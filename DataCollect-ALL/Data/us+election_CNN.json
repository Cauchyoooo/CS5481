        "summary": "A bombshell legal filing from special counsel Jack Smith unsealed Wednesday contains new evidence in the election subversion case against Donald Trump. The filing emphasizes Trump’s fake electors plot and describes the former president’s attempts to sow confusion in the aftermath of the election. Trump and his “private operatives sought to create chaos, rather than seek clarity, at polling places where states were continuing to tabulate votes,” the filing says. It also asserts that Trump said “the details don’t matter” when he was warned that false claims about voter fraud wouldn’t survive courtroom scrutiny."
