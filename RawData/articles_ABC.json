One of Australia's best journalists and top political analysts, she's spent most of her 35-year career in journalism reporting on Australian federal politics, and the country's major policy debates. A journalist, author and essayist, she was formerly the political editor of The Australian Financial Review. Australia's election campaign will not be fought in the way the US race was fought: as a battle between rage or joy. But we should despair that it will feature little of the policy rigour or ambition that economists like Geoff Carmody brought to battles gone by.  Analysis by Laura Tingle Questions are being raised about how alleged war crimes by the Australian Defence Force are investigated, following the response to the Brereton inquiry. Topic:Army The reality of the Middle East conflict is that of an ever-widening fight between two terrorist organisations and an increasingly militant state that is ignoring international calls for restraint, including from its most powerful ally. Analysis by Laura Tingle Climate Change Authority head Matt Kean says expert advice differs to what Peter Dutton says about nuclear and renewables being companions not competitors. Topic:Nuclear Energy Australia's housing crisis is a perfect storm of issues that requires a reset of the housing debate which so far has not been able to happen in the poisonous political competition of 2024. Analysis by Laura Tingle Productivity Commission chair Danielle Wood says she welcomes concessions made by the Albanese government to put clearer scrutiny of proposals for industry assistance into its Future Made in Australia legislation. Topic:Business, Economics and Finance For those with long political memories, there has been a bit of deja vu all over again in federal politics this week. Analysis by Laura Tingle With the national accounts this week showing the economy barely registering a pulse, more oxygen was expended on accusing the treasurer of being mean to the Reserve Bank than on what is happening in the economy. Analysis by Laura Tingle The 2026 census questions on gender and sexual orientation that have been at the centre of a political brawl for the past week have been revealed to the ABC. Topic:LGBT The governor-general will soon receive the final report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veterans Suicide. Grieving families are hoping it will lead to lasting change. Topic:Veterans The Greens and the Coalition seemingly have the government stuck in a game of piggy in the middle, desperately trying to catch the ball as it is thrown between its two major political opponents. Analysis by Laura Tingle Politics is a rough business and not for the faint-hearted but politicians railing about people being vilified should look twice at the way they treat those in wildly unequal positions of power. Analysis by Laura Tingle The opposition leader's capacity to conflate a range of hot button issues, half-truths and misleading assertions is only matched by the federal government's often flat-footed capacity to respond. Analysis by Laura Tingle The idea that Australia may have signed up for \"political commitments\" such as accepting nuclear waste, but we aren't allowed to know, is simply outrageous. Analysis by Laura Tingle The dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975 has long overshadowed another monumental event in Australian political history from that era.  Topic:Federal Parliament This week's inflation numbers have spared the Reserve Bank — and the indebted — the spectre of another rate rise. But it hasn't made the problem go away — for the bank or the government. Analysis by Laura Tingle The CFMEU's history gives us a window into Australia's economic, political and industrial landscape over the past 40 years. Analysis by Laura Tingle After all the bleak headlines of the past couple of weeks, Albanese's cheery optimism may seem a little weird. But some in the government can't believe they're not \"cooked\". Analysis by Laura Tingle It's been a wild week in politics, both here in Australia and across the world. It's a reflection that recent events in the Middle East will continue to dominate and divide voters for some time to come.  Analysis by Laura Tingle Some frame Julian Assange as a free press warrior and others a reckless hacker. As Anthony Albanese backed quiet diplomacy to free him, this unusual move to wield political influence over the legal systems of our democratic allies seems to have been lost in the haze.  Analysis by Laura Tingle An overhaul of the NDIS has left the disability community concerned but minister Bill Shorten says they have nothing to fear. Topic:Disabilities A surge in the polls helped spur the Coalition to announce its nuclear policy. Whether it holds on to that lead will come down to which side can persuade voters that such complex issues can magic up any short-term betterment in their lives. Analysis by Laura Tingle The recent political debates have seen Peter Dutton set the rules of play — it's a strategy that Anthony Albanese will need to counteract quickly to avoid trouble.  Analysis by Laura Tingle Amid the \"direction 99\" controversy, the importance of adequate investment in institutions in order to meet the needs of Australians is once again coming to a head.  Analysis by Laura Tingle In the past 10-15 years, there has been bipartisan support for a range of decisions that profoundly increase the cost of government. Yet the hysterical alarm at increases in the size of government spending fail to acknowledge this. Analysis by Laura Tingle If you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.

By Jarrod Lucas ABC Goldfields Topic:Gold Topic:Gold Topic:Mining Environmental Issues Topic:Nickel Gold has been relentlessly surging to new records. So what's behind the recent demand? Analysis by Ian Verrender The opposition asks Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek to reveal her reasons for granting an Aboriginal protection order over a site earmarked for a tailings dam at the McPhillamys Gold Mine development near Blayney in NSW. Topic:Mining and Metals Industry Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said a recent stock price rise in the company behind the gold mine that she blocked on Indigenous heritage grounds shows some shareholders still see a pathway. Topic:Government and Politics An earth-shaking experiment links the same principles found in your barbecue lighter to the creation of gold nuggets. Topic:Geology Residents in a small Queensland town say gold fever is \"deadset real\" with the prospect of striking it rich drawing thousands of people in each year.  Topic:Gold The head of an Australian mining company says he's committed to trying to get a gold mine built in central western New South Wales, despite federal intervention. However, it could take up to a decade to find and have an alternative site approved. Topic:Gold Commissioner Col Blanch says an internal review is underway into how the trial of two alleged gold thieves was abandoned before it could begin. Topic:Police The Australian share market has ended higher for the ninth-straight session, making it the longest winning streak since December 2015 after strong gains in technology and mining offset a slump in energy stocks. Topic:Financial Markets The environment minister's protection of the headwaters and a section of the Belubula River where the McPhillamys Gold Project mine's tailings dam was to be constructed has been described as a \"dangerous precedent\" by the Minerals Council. Topic:Mining and Metals Industry Two alleged West Australian gold thieves have walked free with all charges against them dismissed, following a police forensics bungle which a defence lawyer argued would have \"undermined public confidence in the justice system\". Topic:Courts and Trials Evolution Mining has confirmed to authorities and the Australian Stock Exchange that it has been targeted in a ransomware attack. Topic:Cyber Crime Only two years after beginning operations at its Pilbara gold project, Calidus Resources has collapsed under debt, even after gold prices recently hit a record high. Topic:Mining and Metals Industry Mining is set to return to the Northern Territory's former centre of gold production, as prices for the precious metal hit record highs this year. Topic:Gold An early 20th century scam involved a promise of diamonds and gold, faux investors, fake letters and a quirky typewriter – all centred on what locals call a \"bloody big hole\". Topic:History Canadian company Agnico Eagle has signed an agreement with traditional owner group Djaara to compensate First Nations people for gold mined at the Central Victorian-based Fosterville Gold Mine. Topic:Gold A gold mine near Orange in the New South Wales Central West has confirmed its waste storage facilities are leaking and farmers in the area are seriously concerned about the potential impacts. Topic:Mining and Metals Industry With Australia holding the biggest share of the world's silver reserves, an 18 per cent price rise over the past six months has people talking — especially when it comes to the silver lining of technology. Topic:Mining and Metals Industry Wars, currency concerns and inflation pressures are driving up the price of physical gold and Australian mining stocks are finally seeing the upside.  Topic:Gold Internal emails show an engineer asked the Ballarat Gold Mine management in May last year not to proceed with a handheld drilling trial without \"minimum\" ground supports \"to ensure that we all get home to our families\". Topic:Workplace Accidents and Incidents The gold price set new records this month, as investors pile in to the safe haven asset amid central bank uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical instability, with many analysts expecting further gains to come.

Some highlights from the day: Before we forget, Arizona and Nevada have still not be called. The states are worth a combined 17 electoral votes and Trump is currently polling ahead in both. And finally, the House of Representatives election race remains ongoing. As of now, the Democrats have won 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218.

What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: Donald Trump has announced his White house chief of staff will be Susan Summerall Wiles, a co-chair of his campaign.

Trump made gains across most demographics, including Hispanic and Black men, once reliable blue constituencies. Senator Bernie Sanders says the party has abandoned working-class voters by cosying up to big-money interests. Others believe Kamala Harris would have pulled off a victory if she'd had more time as the party's candidate. Joe Biden has called on Democrats not to give up hope, declaring the challenge is for his party to get back up again. Slide 1 of 4 Donald Trump says he has a \"powerful\" mandate for his second term in office. Among his priorities are vast tariffs on imports, a mass deportation program, and halting climate action. Trump has named Susie Wiles as his chief of staff, and floated possible roles for RFK Jr and Elon Musk. Former Trump foes such as Hillary Clinton are calling on him to govern for all Americans. Slide 1 of 3 The BOM is warning Australians of a \"shock to the system\" as temperatures rise across parts of the country. A total fire ban is in place across Victoria's Mallee region with much of the state experiencing high fire danger. The high temperatures will move north-east before hitting Queensland.\n\n\n  Slide 1 of 3 The 2024 Melbourne Cup has been won by 100-1 shot, Knight's Choice. Irish-born Robbie Dolan, better known as a singer on a reality TV show, rode Knight's Choice to victory over Warp Speed. Sheila Laxon became the first female trainer to win two Melbourne Cups, partnering John Symons.

The rate is down from 3.8 per cent mid-year and the lowest in 3 and a half years.  According to the ABS, prices rose by 0.2% in the September quarter, compared to the 1% in the three months through June.\n\n  The Reserve Bank is not expected to cut interest rates when it meets next week.

Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money. Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with. Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there. We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services.

California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence. By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights. These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms. We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country. If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.

Donald Trump is headed back to the White House and he's promised to pardon those involved in the January 6 riots. But eight months before Jan 6, a very similar mob stormed a different government building. Armed men, furious about an extension of COVID lockdowns, stormed the state capitol building in Lansing, Michigan. Donald's in, Kamala's out. So what happens next? Join Chas and John as they unpack the fallout from a consequential election with Republican strategist Ford O'Connell and former Democratic Senator Carol Moseley Braun. Sarah Ferguson comes to you from Washington DC following Donald Trump's stunning victory. America's most famous reporter, Bob Woodward, on his surprising optimism about Trump. Plus Laura Tingle with the view from Australia. Donald Trump claims victory in the US election, winning Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and leading in the other four swing states. Republicans gain control of the Senate. Chas and John have the latest. Donald Trump and JD Vance speak to Republican party supporters on election night in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kamala Harris delivers her concession speech in to a tearful crowd at Howard University.  A one-hour special edition of ABC News at 7pm on US Election Day, covering the latest from Washington with Sarah Ferguson and David Speers. Plus the rest of the day's news from home and abroad. It's the tightest, most contentious election in recent US history and the stakes couldn't be higher. Who will win? What will America look like the day after? How will a new president reshape alliances and the global economy? A US election special. Will billionaire media moguls swing the US presidential election? Will a re-elected Trump punish the mainstream media? Should the media believe the opinion polls? Three days out from US Election day, David Speers discusses the campaign with Farrah Tomazin and Jade Macmillan live from Detroit in the key battleground state of Michigan. David interviews former US Ambassador Joe Hockey. US Presidential Elections rely on thousands of people coming together to scrutinise and certify the results. So what happens if they refuse to certify, for political reasons? What could it mean for election day 2024? After a long, long, long campaign, our team of US correspondents sit down in Washington DC with Casey Briggs to dissect all the ups, downs and roundabouts of the US election. Will Biden's garbage gaffe hurt Kamala's campaign? Also, the 1798 law Trump wants to use to carry out mass deportations and with the bro-vote crucial to Trump's election hopes, we ask expert Rachel Kleinfeld why young men are drifting to the right. Elections are an expensive business in America: most people favour spending limits for political campaigns.

Analysis by John Lyons While his 2016 victory may have been fuelled by a willingness to take a gamble on a political unknown, this time the American people know exactly what they are getting. Analysis by Carrington Clarke If you've grown up thinking that Situation Normal is something like the Australian Electoral Commission — an independent electoral authority which operates our voter roll to standard and transparent rules across the country — prepare to be shocked by the Wild West that is voting in America. Analysis by Annabel Crabb Indonesia begins its first-ever joint naval drills with Russia while simultaneously conducting military exercises with Australian forces. Topic:Foreign Affairs North Korea fires at least seven short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast, Japan's defence minister says, shortly after Pyongyang condemns military drills by its rivals. Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War The question about whether a woman can become the president of the United States has been asked time and again. Yet in other parts of the world, the question has already been answered with an emphatic \"yes\". Topic:US Elections So potent is the backlash against identity politics, Kamala Harris has been largely and deliberately silent on the historic nature of her candidacy and potential victory. Analysis by Patricia Karvelas Furious crowds throw mud at Spanish King and call him a murderer after floods devastate the region of Valencia, killing hundreds.  Topic:Floods Maia Sandu has claimed victory in a tense presidential run-off against pro-Russian rival Alexandr Stoianoglo, with almost 95 per cent of the votes counted. Topic:World Politics As Americans face one of their most consequential elections for years, a subtext is running through the conversations of many of those anxiously waiting for election day: could this country face upheaval or even violence in coming weeks? The trauma of the Capitol riots in 2021 remains seared into the memories of Americans.  Analysis by John Lyons History's lesson is that the election of a black woman to the White House goes against the odds and would be a huge break in an almost unbroken conga line of white men. But, of course, it is possible. Analysis by Leigh Sales Analysts said that mounting socio-economic grievances led to the downfall of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which has governed the country since 1966. Topic:Elections Women in the Pacific are 14 times more likely to die from cervical cancer than in Australia, but there are hopes a record philanthropic donation will change that. Topic:Women's Health The Bank of China is on the brink of establishing a branch in Papua New Guinea's capital Port Moresby, a move that is being watched closely by the Australian government. Topic:Foreign Affairs North Korea fires a long-range ballistic missile, marking Pyongyang's first weapons test since South Korea accused the country of sending tens of thousands of soldiers to Russia. Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War After months of delays, Pacific leaders this week completed a tour of riot stricken French Pacific territory New Caledonia, suggesting a Pacific police force could help lower the temperature.   Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Israeli parliament passes legislation that could threaten the work of the main UN agency providing aid to people in Gaza by barring it from operating on Israeli soil. Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party has ruled for almost all of Japan's postwar period. But it lost its parliamentary majority at Sunday's national election. Could smaller parties be key for Japan's future government? Topic:World Politics At the meeting between 26 member countries, proposals to establish new marine protected areas and revise catch limits for krill are rejected, while existing krill management measures are rolled back. Australia says it's a \"backwards step\", putting the Antarctic ecosystem at risk.  Topic:Fishing and Aquaculture Industry Iran's military says the Israeli warplanes used \"very light warheads\" to target border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan and around Tehran.

Topic:ABC The ABC's Days Like These podcast was conceived as a short-term audio offering when COVID-19 up-ended the world, but its stories about life-changing events continue to resonate. Topic:ABC Back in 2017, Bridget Brennan and Isabella Higgins were the only two members of the Indigenous Reporting Team. As referendum day approaches, they reflect on how far coverage of Indigenous affairs has come and how far there is still to go. Topic:Referendums As the fourth season of the beloved series premieres, its impact has been felt far and wide. The show has helped spur on academic research, informed legislation and contributed to the creation of dozens of intergenerational playgroups.

Some highlights from the day: Before we forget, Arizona and Nevada have still not be called. The states are worth a combined 17 electoral votes and Trump is currently polling ahead in both. And finally, the House of Representatives election race remains ongoing. As of now, the Democrats have won 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218.

What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: Donald Trump has announced his White house chief of staff will be Susan Summerall Wiles, a co-chair of his campaign.

Analysis by Julia Baird Tim Winton's sobering, grimly-compelling new book, Juice, is a reminder that knowledge is power — if we can do something with it. Eco-anxiety can only fester if we feel we are unable to effect change. Analysis by Julia Baird Suchita Smith was born with a degenerative condition that leads to short stature and badly-formed joints, causing significant chronic pain. But she loves to dance — and as physical limitations have taken hold, she has learnt to find other ways to do it. Topic:Disabilities Any efforts to kickstart conversations about abuse should be applauded. But as a serious reflection of what domestic violence is really like, It Ends With Us falls short. Analysis by Julia Baird Could it be true that midlife crises are worthy, necessary expeditions and not simply cringey, cliched self-indulgence? The central character in Miranda July's new book, All Fours, thinks so. Analysis by Julia Baird In the past few days, spotlights have narrowed and focused on one face above others: Jill Biden. Will she do what is right for her husband, the country? And what will this mean? Analysis by Julia Baird Last weekend, whilst swimming in what looked like a protected natural rock pool, I was pulled into a dangerous rip that was dumping onto a reef. My mind cleared as I slowed down and I thought: \"So this is it. This is how people drown.\" Analysis by Julia Baird Yet again, the manufacturers of a wildly popular drug, taken by millions of women globally, have not collected data on what this drug might do to a woman's reproductive organs or offspring. Analysis by Julia Baird Jon Owen, the pastor of Sydney's Wayside Chapel, has spent decades caring for the broken, eschewing a comfortable life for one of radical compassion. He's learned he needs to commit to certain regular habits in order to protect his own mental health, writes Julia Baird. Topic:Mental Health For many of us, Mother's Day is a time when our hearts are a bit sore. I miss my own mother so much. I miss her humour, her levity, her wisdom, and the way she made everything seem better. So how should we think about this day when grief is still fresh? Topic:Parenting Dave Tarnowski's disappointing affirmations are making millions on Instagram laugh. But his point is serious: As a man who has lived with depression and anxiety his entire life, he wants to strip stigma from mental illness and make people feel seen. Topic:Happiness It's been more than a decade since Saxon Mullins accused a man of raping her behind his father's nightclub in Kings Cross. Since then she's learned a lot about endurance — and the life-saving power of pop music. Topic:Sexual Offences Now might be a good time to reflect on how devotedly and brutally mastheads and prominent commentators seek to undermine, discredit and destroy women who allege sexual assault, or report on it. Analysis by Julia Baird The steady click of needles and hooks on couches around Australia tells us that knitters have been onto the very real therapeutic benefits of crochet for a long time, writes Julia Baird. Topic:Craft After being diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in 2017, author and commentator Jamila Rizvi drew on the strength of her support network to stay upright. \"Our narratives of illness are, in my view, too focused on stoicism and solitude,\" she says. Analysis by Julia Baird How do you go on when you lose someone you love in a flash, a blink, a moment? When they go to the shops and never return? In the immediate aftermath, is it even possible? Analysis by Julia Baird You might hope we'd think for a moment about what it might be like to confront mortality as a baying mob rifles through your medical records, presses their faces up against your window, screaming, demanding you reveal yourself now. Analysis by Julia Baird One of the greatest myths is that by just being positive, or cheerful, we can somehow erase our problems. What I'm more interested in is the simpler question of: how do we go on?  Analysis by Julia Baird With the number of eyes fixed on Taylor Swift’s glittering ascension, any political figure who would dismiss her as a woman unaware of her own power — or unprepared to wield it — would be a fool, writes Julia Baird. Analysis by Julia Baird In its final week long-time co-hosts Julia Baird and Ellen Fanning pay tribute to The Drum's legacy of sharing, listening and inclusion. Analysis by Julia Baird For awe hunters, the everyday is often the extraordinary and the smallest wonders can be transformative. Their secrets can be yours, too — you just need to open your eyes. Topic:Mental Wellbeing Today, women MPs are no longer staying quiet, bending like pretzels to fit into politics as they once did. Patience is wearing out, writes Julia Baird. Analysis by Julia Baird A landmark report has found the incidence of domestic abuse is greater amongst Anglicans in Australia than the general population.  Topic:Domestic Violence The confidential report, sent to The Drum, indicates the party was made aware of concerns around bullying and intimidation in 2015, with women reporting being silenced at meetings and men engaging in chauvinistic behaviour. Topic:Government and Politics Jozef Maragol and Anet Eyvazians were left shattered when their 16-month-old daughter was pronounced dead hours after they dropped her off at day care. Now, charges have been laid and the date set for a coronial inquest, but questions remain about why it has taken so long to investigate Arianna's death.

Analysis by Ian Verrender It may not be explicitly mentioned by the RBA when it keeps rates on hold, but the biggest risk to the global economy is the United States's debt levels and who wins this week's presidential election. Analysis by Ian Verrender Rupert Murdoch has been a kingmaker around the world for decades but, as Americans prepare to got to the polls, it's another election that has backed News Corp into a corner. Analysis by Ian Verrender What, or more precisely who, is to blame for the inflation episode that has up-ended our lives for the past three years? Analysis by Ian Verrender Solomon Lew has fulfilled a long-held dream by taking the reins at Myer. But it has comes at a time when many shoppers and investors have grown tired of its business model and believe it belongs to a bygone era.

Analysis by Ian Verrender It's a matter of when, not if, the Reserve Bank will take the knife to interest rates, but first home buyers may only see a fleeting, and possibly minuscule, improvement in affordability. Analysis by Ian Verrender While Australian households are amongst the world's most indebted — courtesy of hefty mortgages — Chinese households are stacked to the rafters with savings. That sounds great, but it's causing real problems for the country's economy. Analysis by Ian Verrender A day after oil prices surged, US President Joe Biden warned Israel against military strikes on Iran's oil export facilities for good reason — any attack could ignite another bout of inflation, and possibly plunge the world into recession.

Analysis by Ian Verrender Central banks, including the RBA, subscribe to an old economics theory that unemployment must rise in order for inflation to fall. It's one they should consign to the dustbin. Analysis by Ian Verrender If the latest instalment in the Murdoch family saga tells us anything, it is that while the patriarch no longer jokes about immortality, he's at least retained his dark sense of humour. Analysis by Ian Verrender The Russian and Chinese economies are lurching into ever more perilous territory, threatening the nations' alliance.

We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes: Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services. Go to Activity Controls Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services. Go to My Ad Center Manage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services. Go to About You Choose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads. Go to Shared Endorsements Manage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services. Go to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services My Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity. Go to My Activity Google Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products. Go to Dashboard Manage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number. Go to Personal Info When you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including: You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google. Export your data To delete your information, you can: Delete your information Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account. And finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies. There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including: Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search. When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting. We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases: We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information. If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to: We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies. We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We build security into our services to protect your information All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected. We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including: You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google. Export your data To delete your information, you can: Delete your information We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings: When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems. You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information. We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it. We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data. When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google LLC and its affiliates, including YouTube, Android, and services offered on third-party sites, such as advertising services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to: We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the last changes were published and we offer access to archived versions for your review. If changes are significant, we’ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). The following privacy notices provide additional information about some Google services: If you’re a member of an organization that uses Google Workspace or Google Cloud Platform, learn how these services collect and use your personal information in the Google Cloud Privacy Notice. The following links highlight useful resources for you to learn more about our practices and privacy settings. An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Ltd, Google Payment Corp, and Google Dialer Inc. Learn more about the companies providing business services in the EU. A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations. An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content. Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in \"local storage\" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps. A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices. You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings. Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information. This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user. This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies. A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited. This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality. Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this: A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed. Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies. On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services. If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy. In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches. You can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity. Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us. This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them. You can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services. For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads. For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people. Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services. For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization. Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include: When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities. For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account. For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads. For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly. If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report. For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more. There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this. We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads. You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account. For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account). For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services. For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include: When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services. Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information. For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users. Examples of these services include: When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store. For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information. Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently. For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices. For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you. Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include: For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears. For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information. Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps."

(AP: Chris Szagola) Donald Trump has been given the freedom to comment publicly on witnesses and jurors in the hush money trial that led to his first criminal conviction after a judge modified a gag order imposed on the former US president. In a five-page ruling, Judge Juan M Merchan wrote that the gag order was meant to \"protect the integrity of the judicial proceedings\" and that protections for witnesses and jurors no longer applied because the trial had ended and the jury had been discharged. The order had been in place since March 26, several weeks before the beginning of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about Mr Trump's tendency to rail against those involved in his many legal cases.  The judge said it had been his \"strong preference\" to continue the order stopping the former US president from making comments about the jurors, but he upheld a separate order prohibiting the disclosure of their identities or addresses.  The identities and addresses of jury members are still protected under the gag order imposed on Donald Trump. (Reuters: Jane Rosenberg) \"There is ample evidence to justify continued concern for the jurors,\" Judge Merchan wrote. Others connected to the case such as court staff, the prosecution, and the judge's own family are still protected under the order prohibiting Mr Trump from commenting until he is sentenced on July 11. Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels.  She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. The crime is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors have not said if they would seek incarceration, and it is unclear if the judge would impose such a sentence.  Other options include a fine or probation. The decision — just days before Trump's presidential debate on Thursday with Joe Biden — clears the presumptive Republican nominee to again go on the attack against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, Ms Daniels, and other trial witnesses. Mr Trump's lawyers had asked the judge to lift the gag order completely, arguing there was nothing to warrant restricting Mr Trump's First Amendment rights after the trial's conclusion. Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the ruling \"another unlawful decision by a highly conflicted judge\" and said Mr Trump's lawyers would challenge it immediately.  A lawyer for Stormy Daniels said the restrictions imposed on Mr Trump were \"extraordinary, but clearly justified given the defendant's uncontrollable daily rants\". During the trial, Judge Merchan held Mr Trump in contempt of court, fined him $10,000 for violating the gag order, and threatened to put him in jail if he did it again. Following his conviction, Trump called the gag order \"nasty\".

        "content": "Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:World Politics RFK Jr says he can't bear the sound of his own voice, but he's hoping Americans like what he has to say. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) He's an environmentalist and conspiracy theorist, an anti-establishment figure from one of America's most storied political families, a virile 70-year-old with a host of health issues. It can be hard to get a handle on Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of former president John F Kennedy, but one thing's for sure: his bid for the White House can't be easily dismissed. The independent candidate has fallen short of qualifying for this week's presidential debate, but his polling numbers — up to around 15 per cent — suggest his candidacy could be a deciding factor in who takes the Oval Office in 2024. That's because the winner of the expected Biden–Trump rematch could be determined by a relatively small number of votes in a handful of swing states. If RFK Jr siphons significantly more support from one of the main candidates than the other, it could make all the difference. As America endures the year's first heatwave, Colin McEvers is sweating in his shirt and tie in downtown Annapolis, Maryland, trying to recruit passers-by to support RFK Jr's presidential bid. Colin McEvers says he's collected thousands of signatures in Maryland to get RFK Jr on the ballot. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) \"Hi guys, how are you doing today?\" the towering teenager says, as all 6 foot, 10 inches of him strides towards a couple in their early 40s. \"Sorry to bother you. My name's Colin. \"I'm working for the RFK Jr campaign. We're just trying to get some signatures to get an independent on the ballot for Maryland... as another option besides Biden and Trump, basically.\" Third-party candidates are not guaranteed to get their names on ballots in US elections. The requirements vary from state to state. Here in Maryland, RFK Jr needs 10,000 verified names on a petition. McEvers, the state campaign co-ordinator, says he's personally collected more than 3,000. RFK Jr needs 10,000 verified signatures to get on the ballot in Maryland.  (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) With polls showing a majority of voters have unfavourable views of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the case for a third option is hitting home. \"Trump and Biden are both often off the rails,\" says Karl Klinghard, who's visiting from Tennessee and says he'll \"probably\" vote for RFK Jr in this November's election. \"I think RFK couldn't do any harm,\" he says. \"I like his environmental aspect, and I think he's got a lot to offer, you know just from his background and private industry and all those things.\" Ranard Hall signed the petition in Annapolis because he's always liked the Kennedys.  (ABC News: Bradley McLennan ) Ranard Hall doesn't really know what any of RFK Jr's policies are, but he signs the petition anyway because of the Kennedy connection. \"I was kind of young when John Kennedy got shot, but I always liked [the Kennedys],\" he says. \"I thought it was like a dominant family. \"So, you know, what I'm saying is his grandson or whoever he is, I am going to vote for him.\" RFK Jr was nine years old when his uncle, then-president John F Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963. Five years later, Robert F Kennedy — JFK's brother and the current candidate's father — was also shot dead while he was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. RFK Jr, one of the late Bobby Kennedy's 11 children, has long espoused the view that the death of his uncle was orchestrated by the CIA. Robert F Kennedy, pictured with his wife Ethel and 10 of their children in about 1967. Their 11th child was born after RFK's assassination in 1968. (Getty Images) He's also called for a new investigation into the murder of his father, arguing the evidence suggests the man serving a life sentence for the killing, Sirhan Sirhan, did not fire the fatal shots. Perhaps these experiences helped shape RFK Jr's deep distrust of government, institutions and the media, a worldview that has seen him embrace vaccine conspiracy theories. He's been a vocal advocate of the now-debunked theory that vaccines in children are linked to autism.  During the pandemic, he suggested COVID may have been engineered to target certain ethnic groups, and appeared to back a theory that Bill Gates was using the vaccine to control people via microchip. \"What was yesterday's conspiracy theory is today's truth,\" says Josh Mazer, Maryland Team Kennedy campaign co-ordinator. \"He's simply the most intelligent person in any room I've ever walked into.\" In recent campaign appearances, RFK Jr has appeared to tone down his vaccine rhetoric, but still rails against COVID public health measures. He described them as \"the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known\" during a recent speech at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington DC. RFK Jr spoke at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington DC in June.  (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) The speech also touched on one of RFK Jr's core policy proposals: slashing military funding and getting out of foreign wars. \"We have forfeited our moral authority because we have supported dictators and corrupt regimes and subverted democracy around the globe,\" he told the crowd. Some of the biggest cheers came when he said that, on his first day in office, he would drop all charges against Julian Assange and pardon Edward Snowden. \"Free Assange, free Assange,\" audience members chanted. As news broke on Monday, local time, that Mr Assange had reached a plea deal with US authorities, RFK Jr suggested that a monument be built to the Australian to educate the American public about the importance of free speech. Describing Mr Assange as a “generational hero”, RFK Jr lamented the terms of the deal, which he said meant the US had succeeded in criminalising journalism. While the Libertarians didn't vote him in as their 2024 candidate, he had plenty of fans in the room. \"I like the fact that he's not a politician,\" said Nancy Lou Little, a veterinarian who shares his scepticism about vaccines, America's health regulation bodies and big pharma. \"When I first heard him interviewed, I started crying because he was talking about our health problems. And I've been waiting 35 years for somebody to talk about those.\" Asked what she likes about RFK Jr, Nancy Lou Little gushes, \"Oh my gosh, almost everything\".  ( ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) RFK Jr began his bid as a Democratic candidate, challenging Joe Biden for the nomination. Last October, he announced he was running as an independent. His \"America First\" tendencies and distrust of big government potentially appeals to Republican voters. Yet his credentials as an environmental lawyer who helped clean up the Hudson River in New York, and his rejection of a ban on TikTok, could see win him support from younger, more left-leaning voters. That's the thing with RFK Jr — you can really choose your own adventure. RFK Jr's politics are difficult to neatly pigeonhole.  (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) \"I'm not sure anyone knows where he stands because he is all over the place ideologically,\" says Bernard Tamas, a professor of political science at Valdosta State University in Georgia. \"A big part of his appeal is the fact that Americans are very disenchanted with the political system right now and with both candidates.\" Colin McEvers, the campaigner in Maryland, likes what he sees of the candidate's plans to make first home loans more affordable by guaranteeing government-backed mortgage interest rates. \"I want to own a home in the future, I want to build a family, and it's very hard for people of my age range to do that.\" If you're on social media, you might have come across a couple of recent viral videos this week, neither of which casts the US president in a flattering light. The famous last name and clever use of social media — not to mention his wealthy running mate, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan —are all helping RFK Jr outpoll the other third-party candidates. Recent polling also suggests his campaign is attracting young people and Latinos in particular, and that's a worry for Democrats who have traditionally done well with those voter groups. But Dr Tamas says third-party candidates have historically seen their support wane as election day nears. \"Most people return to want to vote for one of the two major party candidates,\" he says. \"You're not likely to see progressive voters sticking, or large percentages of them sticking, with third-party candidates when they're afraid of Donald Trump going back into the White House.\" While Republicans initially seemed less worried about RFK Jr's potential, their position has started to sharpen. In a recent social media post, Donald Trump referred to him simply as \"Junior\" and suggested he was a \"Democrat plant\". Dr Tamas says he's starting to see signs RFK Jr could be more of a threat to Trump than Biden. \"The fear, I think, is that he is going to take votes from what we call the 'Never Trumpers', the moderates that don't like Biden but don't like Trump either.\" Jack Schlossberg was a vocal opponent of his cousin's candidacy from the outset. \"He's trading in on Camelot, celebrity, conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame... his candidacy is an embarrassment,\" JFK's grandson said in a video posted last year. More recently, the posts by the 31-year-old son of Australia's US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy have taken on a more colourful twist. In a series of videos, Schlossberg adopted various fake personas — including a southerner named Wade, a Russian named Vlad and a New Yorker named Joshua — to describe RFK Jr as a liar who was pumped full of testosterone and who was playing into Russia's hands. Other prominent members of the Kennedy clan have also come out against RFK Jr, describing his candidacy as perilous and saddening. The family, as close to Democratic royalty as it gets, was not happy that a campaign ad played at the Superbowl traded on their name. The Kennedys' connection to the current Democratic president is also founded in their shared Irish Catholic roots. Family members posed at the White House with the president on St Patrick's Day and more than a dozen of them, including five of RFK Jr's siblings, endorsed Biden at a campaign event the following month. At 70, RFK Jr is a relatively young man compared to Biden, 81, and Trump, 78.  He makes a virtue of his physical prowess. Internet users briefly lost their minds over videos of him working out shirtless. Fox News swooned about his \"sheer masculinity\", CNN said there was \"nothing junior about RFK Jr's pecs\". But RFK Jr also has some significant health challenges. His voice is gravelly and strained — a result, he says, of a neurological condition known as spasmodic dysphonia. \"I think it makes it problematical for people to listen to me,\" he told News Nation. \"I cannot listen to myself on TV, I will never listen to this broadcast.\" And then there's the worm. New York Times reporting revealed that RFK Jr claims to have suffered cognitive issues starting around 2010, including memory loss and brain fog, due to a parasite in his brain. During his divorce proceedings, he said that a doctor had told him his problems could be \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\". Shortly after the reports surfaced, RFK Jr leaned in, joking about eating more brain worms. He hasn't produced medical records on said parasite, but his campaign says he has now recovered. His connection with the natural world goes far beyond worms. He has several dogs and is a bird enthusiast who once kept an emu. And he recently introduced his followers to the two ravens who \"join him\" for meditations on his balcony every day, and who he says he's \"taming\". It might seem out there, but perhaps the kind of voter attracted to RFK Jr sees it as part and parcel of his unconventional appeal. There's certainly no sign that news of the ravens or the brain worm have damaged his run. While he didn't make it into the first presidential debate, under rules based on ballot access and poll numbers, it's possible he could qualify for the second one. That kind of airtime is something neither the Biden or Trump campaign is likely to welcome in a contest predicted to come down to the wire. \"I think both candidates, both campaigns should be concerned about RFK,\" says Dr Tamas. \"Because this election is going to be extremely, extremely close.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:World Politics Topic:US Elections Independents US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Take a look back at how the debate unfolded — and how America reacted. By Brad Ryan in Washington DC It's approaching 2am here in Washington, so this is where we'll wrap the blog — but plenty will be said about the debate in the days to come. Here's a quick rundown of what took place: Thanks for coming along for the ride! And if you're looking for a closer look at the key moments from the night, check out this piece from the ABC's North America correspondent Barbara Miller and Basel Hindeleh: By Andrew Thorpe Biden has paid a post-debate visit to a Waffle House in Atlanta, where he was met with a friendly reception — but also faced some questions from reporters on his performance. The president said he thought he did well overall, but \"it's hard to debate a liar\". \"New York Times pointed how he lied 26 times [sic]. Big lies,\" he said. Biden also said it was true that he was sick during the debate, telling reporters \"I have a sore throat\". By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan It's difficult to predict at this stage whether the panic sweeping through Democratic circles will translate into any serious moves to oust Joe Biden. But there are a few names that tend to come up in chatter about possible alternatives. Vice-president Kamala Harris would be an obvious choice, except she isn't polling strongly either. Then there are a couple of prominent governors, including Gavin Newsom in California and Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan. There's also a theory, pushed by some Republicans, that Michelle Obama could emerge as a candidate, despite the former first lady denying she'd be interested. Newsom, for his part, has come out in Biden's defence, appearing on MSNBC to argue that Democrats need to \"have the back\" of the president. By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC I chatted to Michael Murphy after the debate wrapped up at a watch party in downtown DC. He was working an 11-hour shift at the bookstore/pub that hosted the viewing, but tuned into the debate at every chance he could in between running drinks and meals. He said he voted for Joe Biden in the last election but that he thought former president Donald Trump won the debate \"by a landslide\". \"He was just able to clarify and elaborate more on those questions. There were times with Biden where you can see his mind wasn't completely there. There was a lot of tripping over words. It was a lot.\" But Michael's vote isn't Trump's just yet. He says he's still just as undecided and unimpressed about his options as ever. \"Both candidates were super underwhelming to me. I think it was a lot of flak. No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, I think you can see that. \"I mean is this the standard that we're holding our country up to? \"I don't think either one of them represents the American way completely. \"This is one of the strangest elections we've ever had in America. I think on both sides, we feel like they're unqualified. But we have to choose. So here we are.\" By Andrew Thorpe For Robert F Kennedy Jr (remember him?) it seems like the winning move in this debate might have been not to play. That's not to say he didn't try, though — he hosted his own event, complete with lectern and podium, and spliced himself into the footage while responding to moderators' questions. He told NewsNation voters were \"tired of choosing the lesser of two evils\" and wanted a candidate younger than the 81-year-old Biden and 78-year-old Trump (Kennedy is 70). \"Hopefully some of them are going to start looking at me,\" he said. By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC I've just returned from a packed pub in downtown DC, where scores of Americans sat down to tune into the historic debate over beers and burgers. Bingo cards with buzz words like \"Jan 6\", \"Putin\" and \"Make America Great Again\" lay on tables, with punters cheering every time another catchphrase was mentioned. Even here in Washington, in a district known to be a Democratic stronghold, reactions were pretty mixed about who performed better. One man told me he thought Trump \"won by a landslide\". Another said she was impressed with Biden's performance. What was agreed on by those we spoke with is the grave dissatisfaction with the options on the table this election. When former president Donald Trump was asked if he would accept the results of the upcoming election, the room erupted in boos and groans. Moments later, President Joe Biden called Trump \"a whiner\" - a label that was met with laughs and claps. \"Is anyone excited about this debate?\" an MC asked the crowd during a break in debate coverage. \"Noooo,\" the pub groaned back. \"Does anyone feel the American people are being served by this debate?\" \"Nooooo,\" the crowd yelled louder. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Donald Trump has kept everyone guessing on who he's going to select as his running mate, suggesting he'll announce his pick at next month's Republican national convention. He added to the speculation by hinting the chosen candidate would be in Atlanta as he took to the debate stage. Three of the top contenders are rumoured to be Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Ohio Senator JD Vance, and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum. Rubio popped up in the post-debate 'spin room' and took aim at Joe Biden's performance, claiming there were times he \"couldn't understand\" what the president was saying. Burgum took to X while the candidates were still on stage to question whether vice president Kamala Harris should take over part way through. And Vance argued Trump had shown \"so much more energy and clarity\" than Biden. Trump could still go with a surprise choice but for now, the frontrunners appear to be doing what they can to give themselves the best shot in the race. By Emily Clark The two men — who are asking for the American people to again put them in the White House — discussed their golf handicap. Biden: \"Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap when I was vice-president down to a six. By the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?\" Trump: \"That's the biggest lie — that he's a six handicap — of all.\" Biden: \"I was eight handicap.\" Trump: \"Yeah … Never. I've seen your swing. I know your swing. Let's not act like children.\" Indeed. They also exchanged barbs over the allegation Trump once called American veterans \"losers and suckers\". Biden: \"I went to the World War I cemetery. He refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general … [who] told me he didn't want to go there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers. My son was not a loser or a sucker. You're the loser. You're the sucker.\" Biden: \"A four-star general standing to your side who was on your staff said you said it.\" Trump: \"The losers and suckers story is a lie. It's a disgrace.\" Considering just how many legal woes Trump has at the moment and his recent felony conviction, those issues didn't come up a whole lot during the debate. But when Biden did go on the attack, he accused Trump of having sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant. Trump: \"I did not have sex with a porn star.\" By Andrew Thorpe By Emily Clark in Washington DC Planet America host John Barron has this analysis of today's debate: \"Four years ago, when Trump and Biden first debated, it degenerated into an unedifying, unpresidential squabble. \"This time, the mute button kept the cross-talk to a minimum, but given uninterrupted time to talk, Biden struggled to make his points clearly, and on one potentially catastrophic occasion, failed to complete a sentence. \"That seemingly senior moment may well define this campaign, and doom Biden's candidacy. \"Beyond that blank, Biden looked and sounded frail. The White House says he has a cold. He's three years older than Trump, but it looked like 20. \"Trump meanwhile projected confidence, certainly, strength, and simplicity — everything is terrible now and was great when he was in charge. The fact checkers will have a field day with his many distortions, but that's unlikely to matter. \"Many Democrats are now in a panic and looking at whether they can replace Biden. \"Donald Trump, twice impeached, tossed out by voters, whose own vice-president won't endorse him — some of whose former top advisors say he's unfit — must for now be considered the favourite to win a second term in November.\" By Brad Ryan in Washington DC Host broadcaster CNN said in advance that its moderators weren't in an ideal situation to fact-check live, but it would produce some fact-checks afterwards. CNN's fact-checker Daniel Dale has just appeared on the network. He says Trump made at least 30 false claims, and Biden made about nine, based on early counts. Trump's included: But Biden: Other fact-checks around tonight include this from PolitiFact, this from the Associated Press and this from the New York Times. (But no, we haven't had time to fact-check the fact-checks, so sharing these resources isn't an ABC endorsement.) By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Joe Biden stopped by a campaign event just after the debate, striking an upbeat tone in front of his supporters. \"We're going to beat this guy, we need to beat this guy,\" he said to cheers from the crowd. \"And I need you in order to beat him, you're the people I'm running for.\" It was a brief but energetic appearance that stood in contrast to his stumbles on the debate stage. And the president gave no sign that he might be rethinking his candidacy, as some have suggested he should, instead pointing to a rally he has planned for tomorrow. \"Heading to North Carolina!\" he said. By Andrew Thorpe By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Both campaigns are now in spin mode, with each side criticising the other candidate's performance. Joe Biden's campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon issued a statement claiming the president presented a \"positive and winning vision\" for the US, in contrast with a \"dark and backwards window\" from his predecessor. Trump's campaign argued the former president had delivered the \"greatest debate performance\" in history. \"Despite taking a week-long vacation at Camp David to prepare for the debate, Biden was unable to defend his disastrous record on the economy and the border,\" campaign officials Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Vice-President Kamala Harris has just been interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\" she says of Biden's performance. Harris is trying to take the focus off the debate, and put it on Biden's record in office. \"I'm not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I've been watching the last three and a half years.\" Cooper puts to her that Democratic politicians who watched the debate are worried behind the scenes. \"One said it was a disaster and another calls it a trainwreck,\" he tells her. He asks if she's honestly not concerned herself. \"It was a slow start. That's obvious. To everyone. I'm not going to debate that point. I'm talking about the choice in November. I'm talking about one of the most important elections in our collective lifetime.\" By Andrew Thorpe The Australia Institute's Emma Shortis tells the ABC that Biden's clear inability to prosecute Trump's lies about reproductive rights and other issues will have major electoral consequences. By Andrew Thorpe By Andrew Thorpe It's not just American commentators who are united in their takes on the two candidates' performances. Darren Perth: Awkward beginning.  The choice is like choosing to suck on a lemon or a lime.  Both not overly palatable. Mohamed:\nThis is very hard to watch O: How is Biden's age such a big topic when a) he's only three years older than Trump and b) there is hours of video footage of Trump being incoherent, etc - much more often than Biden! weev: It's an agonising contest. A guy who is too old but believes in democratic values versus a slightly younger and more energised chap who relies on lies and bluster with authoritarian tendencies. What a state of affairs. Mary: Please explain how in a country of 300million plus the only candidates for president are a geriatric and a convicted felon ?!! Scott: Same old Trump, can't stay on topic and answer a question, no facts, just rambling. Unfortunately it doesn't feel like Biden is sharp enough to hold Trump to account. Michael Woodley: Biden is doing so poorly in this debate. This could turn the election. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan The US political landscape is famously polarised, and so is the media here. But across the spectrum there appears to be broad agreement that Democrats sense real trouble following Joe Biden's performance. We've already heard from CNN correspondent John King, who suggested some in the party were discussing whether the president should step aside. The conservative network Fox News ran a ticker along the bottom of its post-debate coverage, headed \"Biden's disastrous debate performance.\" And even the left-leaning MSNBC raised the alarm, with presenter Joy Reid reporting the reaction from Democrats was \"somewhere approaching panic\" because of a view that Biden seeming \"extremely feeble\" and \"extremely weak\". It will make for a very difficult environment for any of Biden's supporters to step into with the aim of defending how he did. By If Youre Listening podcast host Matt Bevan As both sides desperately court black voters, Donald Trump accused Joe Biden of previously using the term \"superpredators\" in the 1990s — seen as a racially charged term at the time. In fact, Donald Trump is confusing Biden with his former opponent, Hillary Clinton. In a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, then-first lady Hillary Clinton did use the term, while speaking in support of her husband Bill Clinton's controversial 1994 crime bill. While Biden did support the bill, he did not use the term. In fact, he rejected it in 1997, saying most youth weren't \"superpredators\".

(Reuters: Marco Bello) Joe Biden's poor debate performance has resulted in cries from within his party to replace him as a candidate in the United States presidential election. Mr Biden's supporters had hoped the debate, which aired on Thursday night in the US, would erase worries that the 81-year-old was too old to serve another term. While Mr Biden is only three years older than Mr Trump, 78, concerns over age and fitness in the run-up to the election have weighed more heavily on him. Speaking in a hoarse voice and repeatedly losing his train of thought, Mr Biden's debate performance did the opposite of reassuring the Democratic base of his chances to win the presidential race a second time. It sparked calls for the sitting president to step aside as the party's nominee amid fears of a return of Trump to the White House. A longtime advisor to former president Barack Obama, David Axelrod, said there was a \"sense of shock\" with how poorly Mr Biden started the debate. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. While Mr Biden got stronger as the debate got on, \"by that time, I think the panic had set in,\" Mr Axelrod said on CNN. \"And I think you're going to hear discussions that, I don't know will lead to anything, but there are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\" Van Jones, a Democratic political commentator for CNN, said that Mr Biden \"had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence in the country and of the base, and he failed to do that\". \"We're still far from our convention. And there is time for this party to figure out a different way forward if he will allow us to do that,\" Mr Jones said. Rosemarie DeAngelis, a Democrat who watched the debate at a party in South Portland, Maine, said she felt Mr Biden gave the right answers to Trump but \"didn't have the spark that we needed tonight\". \"That's going to be the challenge going forward. This is only June, this is the first, but can he sustain?\" she said. An unnamed \"top\" Biden donor told Reuters that the president's performance was \"disqualifying\" and that he believed there would be a brokered convention, which is when a party in US politics fails to nominate a presidential candidate on the first round of delegate voting. \"There is no way to spin this. His performance was disqualifying. There is going to be a call for a brokered convention,\" the donor said. \"It cannot be described how bad this performance was.\" Fundraising will \"dry up\" as a result of Mr Biden's performance, the donor predicted. \"Money follows enthusiasm. How can anyone with a straight face say, donate to elect Joe? … I will continue to fundraise for him. What else can we all do? There is no option.\" Several US media outlets reported on Democrat anxiety on Mr Biden's candidacy following his debate performance. If you're on social media, you might have come across a couple of viral videos this week, neither of which casts the US president in a flattering light. It's prompted the White House to fight back. Speaking to anonymous Democratic advisers, strategists and donors, several outlets reported calls from within the party for Mr Biden to step down from the race. \"Democrats melt down over Joe Biden's debate disaster\", USA today wrote. \"Democrats are so panicked over President Joe Biden's faltering debate performance they are actively discussing what was once unspeakable: replacing him on the ticket,\" an article on the American political news site Politico said. \"Biden is toast — calling it now\", Jay Surdukowski, an attorney and Democratic activist from New Hampshire, said on Politico. CNN's chief national correspondent, John King, called the debate \"game-changing\" in that Biden's \"dismal\" performance had started conversations within the party about replacing him. \"There is a deep, a wide, and a very aggressive panic in the Democratic Party,\" Mr King said. \"It started minutes into the debate, and it continues right now. It involves party strategists, it involves elected officials, it involves fundraisers. Donald Trump (left) and Joe Biden faced off in their first rematch since the 2020 presidential election. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) An analysis piece by New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker called Mr Biden's performance \"fumbling\" and the Democratic party \"panicking\". \"Biden is about to face a crescendo of calls to step aside,\" an anonymous veteran Democratic strategist told the New York Times. \"Joe had a deep well of affection among Democrats. It has run dry.\" A few key names have been floated around as Mr Biden's potential replacements. Vice-President Kamala Harris is one of them, but she isn't polling strongly either. Another one is Governor of California Gavin Newsom. Mr Newsom was pressed on whether he would consider stepping in for Mr Biden, but he dismissed the questions, saying, \"I will never turn my back on him\". From the left: Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Andy Beshear and Gretchen Whitmer are some of the names that have been mentioned as Biden's potential replacements on the Democratic ballot. The unnamed Biden donor who spoke with Reuters said they thought Andy Beshear, the popular Democratic governor of Kentucky, a deeply Republican state at the federal level, would be the likely winner. \"He won red Kentucky. He'll be a great candidate who can still bring this home. I don't think Newsom will win.\" The donor also raised the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, and the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, as options. Others who Mr Biden beat during the party's 2020 presidential primary could also try again, including senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Replacing Mr Biden on the ballot would be almost impossible unless he chose to step down voluntarily. All the states have already held their presidential primaries, and Democratic rules mandate that the delegates Mr Biden won support him at the party's upcoming national convention unless he tells them he's leaving the race. Mr Biden has given no indication of wanting to bow out. President Biden headed to an Atlanta Waffle House to greet his supporters after the debate. (AP Photo: Evan Vucci) Pressed about the Democratic concerns that he should consider stepping aside, Mr Biden said: \"No, It's hard to debate a liar.\" \"Let's keep going,\" he said when addressing supporters briefly at a watch party near the debate venue. \"See you at the next one.\" The Democratic National Convention is being held in Chicago, but the party has announced that it will hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Mr Biden before in-person proceedings begin. The exact date for the roll call has not yet been set. If Mr Biden did opt to abandon his campaign, his potential replacements could end up having to lobby individual state delegations at the convention, which hasn't happened for Democrats since 1960 with John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson jockeying for votes.

        "content": "Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:US Elections Donald Trump faced off against Joe Biden in a historic US presidential debate. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Ninety minutes, two commercial breaks and no studio audience. The stakes were high for a historically early US presidential debate between current president Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump. Joe Biden had to show he was up to the job, in the face of mounting concerns about his mental and physical fitness. Donald Trump had to appear presidential and show Americans he wanted to win back the White House to fight for their interests, rather than airing grievances about the 2020 election and the criminal cases against him. But neither man exactly lived up to those expectations, with Biden bumbling and Trump blustering. Look back at our live coverage of the debate. Here are the key takeaways from round one of Trump v Biden. It's hard to overestimate the amount of angst there was in Democratic circles ahead of this debate about whether Joe Biden could put in a robust performance. The White House has repeatedly pushed back on reports that the president is slipping mentally. It's hard to see how the party and the majority of Americans — who, according to polls, think the 81-year-old is simply too old to seek another term — will be reassured by Joe Biden's performance. Less than 15 minutes in, there was a cringeworthy moment when he appeared to lose his train of thought, trailing off on an answer about health care benefits. \"Making sure that we are able to make every single solitary person… eligible for what I've been able to do with the uh… COVID — excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with… uh… look… if… we finally beat Medicare,\" the president said before being cut off. Biden appeared confused for much of the debate while Trump spoke. (Reuters: Marco Bello) Trump took that opportunity to hit back with: \"Well, that's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death.\" Joe Biden's voice was raspy and quiet from the outset and he often appeared to struggle to round off his sentences, tripping over his own words. These are hallmarks of the way the president speaks but are becoming more pronounced with age, and this was a particularly bad night in that regard. Reporters being briefed by the Biden campaign said they were being told the voice issues were due to a cold. Those reports didn't start to filter through until the debate was well underway and will likely to be the focus of scrutiny in the wash-up. In comparison, Donald Trump appeared energetic and his voice was commanding. He too has had some seniors' moments in recent months, confusing people and dates, but on the whole, he was sharp tonight. \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence, I don't think he knows what he said, either,\" Trump said at one point about his opponent. Biden's performance improved a little as time went on, but not enough to reverse an overall impression of frailty. It was a more nimble and disciplined Trump than was on display four years ago. Each candidate had two minutes to answer questions, but Trump often used the beginning of his time to rebut what Biden had said or steer the answer to his pet issues, often the issue of illegal migration on the southern border. Moderator Dana Bash had to press him several times to try and get an answer on whether he would accept the result of the election. \"If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,\" the former president said. Trump deflected a question about accepting election results three times. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) He ignored a question about whether Russian president Vladimir Putin's terms for the war in Ukraine were acceptable by talking about veterans' dislike for Biden. He also tried to avoid directly answering a question about his role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. CNN's up-front rule about not being able to fact-check either candidate's responses in real time also appeared to work to his advantage. Among his wilder claims, that abortion rights allowed babies to be killed after birth. Muted microphones didn't stop the name-calling. Biden went on the attack over Trump's criminal convictions, accusing him of having sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant. \"I didn't have sex with a porn star,\" Trump responded. The jury in Donald Trump's \"hush money\" trial finds the former president guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, a felony that could result in prison time. Biden also brought up the civil cases Donald Trump has faced, with a New York jury finding him liable for sexually abusing writer E Jean Carroll. \"You have the morals of an alley cat,\" Biden fired at his opponent. As they discussed the issue of Trump reportedly referring to veterans as suckers and losers, Biden also went on the offensive. His son Beau served in the military, and Joe Biden claims, without evidence, that it was his exposure to a burn pit in Iraq that led to the brain cancer that eventually killed him. \"My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\" Biden threw jabs at Trump and referenced his felony conviction. (AP: Gerald Herbert) Trump said the sucker and loser quote was made up. Trump accused Biden of being the \"worst president in the history of our country\". Close to the end of the debate, things descended into the surreal with the two candidates getting into an argument over golf handicaps. Trump claimed to be still winning club championships. Biden offered to play him, saying he got his handicap down to a six when he was vice-president. Trump said that this was Biden's \"biggest lie of all\". \"I've seen your swing. I know your swing. Let's not act like children,\" he said. Trump attacked Biden over the economy, claiming his administration oversaw \"the greatest economy in history\". Biden pointed out there were fewer jobs at the end of Trump's term than at the start, but Trump was leaning into what many Americans were feeling. Despite the macro indicators showing the economy is improving, people are still struggling with increased prices and a sense that they are worse off. On abortion, Biden attacked Trump for taking credit for appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to abortion two years ago and said if he is re-elected, he will work to enshrine the right to abortion into law. Both candidates debated policies and made claims about abortion and the economy. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) The Democrats' support of reproductive rights was a factor in their better-than-expected performance in the mid-terms and they are hoping it will be a winner again in November. But even on this question, Biden appeared bumbling at times, and wandered into very odd territory as he tried to counter Trump's claims that migrants crossing the border illegally were raping women. \"There's a lot of young women being raped by their in-laws, by their spouses, brothers and sisters, it's just ridiculous\", Biden claimed. There is no evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, but Trump has highlighted a number of recent cases in which women have been raped or killed by people found to be in the US illegally. Trump several times successfully turned the conversation to the border, hitting Biden on an issue he is seen as vulnerable on. Biden reminded the audience that Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill, but again, his delivery and the nuance of this argument may mean it's lost on many viewers not tuning in to daily politics. There's no denying this debate went badly for the president and the early takes are stinging. \"A debate disaster\", headlines the Atlantic. CNN correspondent John King described it as \"game-changing\". \"There is a deep, a wide, and a very aggressive panic in the Democratic party', he said. On MSNBC, David Plouffe, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, called it a \"Defcon 1 moment\". \"The concern level is quite high\", he told the network. Vice-President Kamala Harris acknowledged President Biden's \"slow start\", but told CNN \"it was a strong finish\". The vice-president said it wasn't about the last 90 minutes, but about the last three and a half years. The idea of Joe Biden calling it quits at this late stage has been raised before, but generally in quiet, respectful terms. That's all changed after tonight, and if he does stay it could be very difficult for Joe Biden to turn things around in the next four months. Joe Biden spoke to supporters at a debate night watch party after the debate.

(ABC News) US President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump will meet on a debate stage for the first of two televised face-offs as they embark on a tight rematch race to win the White House in November. It is the first-ever debate between a sitting president and a former one. Here's what you need to know ahead of the debate taking place on Friday morning in Australia. The first debate will air in the US at 9pm Eastern Time on Thursday, which is 11am AEST on Friday. It will be broadcast live on CNN, from a studio in Atlanta, Georgia, but there will be no audience present. More than four months ahead of the November 5 vote, the CNN debate will be the earliest presidential debate in modern US history. The two candidates last faced off in a presidential debate in 2020.

Jeremy Fernandez will be joined by US and political experts for special analysis after the debate. NewsRadio will be streaming the debate live from 11am AEST. Listen via the ABC Listen app. Follow our live blog for all the updates from the US presidential debate CNN said only Biden and Trump met its conditions for participating in the debate. The candidates had to appear on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency, and receive at least 15 per cent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr did not make the cut. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the debate with \"all tools at their disposal\", CNN said. (Reuters: Mike Segar) CNN has shared some rules that the 90-minute debate, moderated by veteran CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, is set to follow. The moderators \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilised discussion\", CNN said. The first debate between Trump and Biden in 2020 was rife with interruptions and attacks. Strategists say there are risks for both candidates, who are locked in a tight race and share low enthusiasm from voters. Hunter Biden's status as a convicted liar could breathe some life into Republicans' efforts to bring down his father, while complicating the mileage Joe Biden can get out of Donald Trump's legal woes. Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are the oldest candidates ever to seek the presidency and viewers will likely question their cognitive abilities and emotional steadiness. Trump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the president's age. Biden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his volatility and sometimes changing positions on issues, such as abortion. Biden's campaign is hoping to talk about abortion and Trump's about immigration, but CNN's moderators will decide the questions. Some topics that are likely to feature in questions include: Both candidates have had their share of unfavourable news coverage that could come up during the debate. For Trump, that includes his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his conviction on 34 felony counts for involvement in a hush money scheme. The same goes for the legal woes facing Biden's son, Hunter, who was convicted of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun. Then-president Trump and Biden debated twice during the 2020 race. Donald Trump has been found guilty in a hush money trial, but his legal woes are far from over. As he continues his bid to retake the White House, here’s a status update on his other court cases. More than 73 million people tuned in for the first exchange, which devolved into a chaotic shouting match. For the second debate, moderators said they would mute each candidate's microphone to allow the other to speak without interruption for the first two minutes of each debate segment. The candidates behaved more civilly and the mute button was not a major factor. A third debate was cancelled after Trump tested positive for COVID-19 and spent three days in a hospital. He declined to participate in a virtual event. Ahead of the upcoming CNN debate, Trump asked the crowd at an election rally in Philadelphia if he should be \"tough and nasty\" or \"nice and calm\" — so what the tone of conversation will be this time around remains to be seen. \"How should I handle him? Should I be tough and nasty and just say, 'You're the worst president in history?' Or should I be nice and calm and let him speak?\" He has thrown some early blows at Biden and CNN, and accused the moderators of being biased against him. The US broadcaster ABC will host a second debate on September 10, but the network has not yet shared details on where the event will be held. Traditionally, there are three presidential debates, however no third Trump-Biden match-up has been announced yet. Vice-President Kamala Harris accepted a CBS News invitation for a vice-presidential debate on either July 23 or August 13, according to a campaign spokesperson. Trump hasn't named his running mate yet.

(AP: Scott Applewhite/Gerald Herbert/Jacquelyn Martin) How old is too old to be president? As Americans gear up to vote in this year's presidential election, it's a question that's been on a lot of people's minds. Especially as the two oldest candidates to ever run for office in the US are running again — breaking the record for the oldest two people to ever compete for the presidency that they set four years ago. Opinion polling has routinely found that voters don't like this, with more people worried about Joe Biden's age than Donald Trump's. A February Ipsos poll found 59 per cent of voters thought both candidates were too old. A New York Times/Siena poll found nearly half of voters thought Biden was too old to handle the job of president. If successful, Biden would be 82 years old at the start of his second term, four years older than Trump, who would be 78. These concerns were amplified in the wake of Friday's presidential debate, during which Biden appeared frail, spoke quietly and seemed to lose his train of thought. But here's the thing: Biden and Trump are not the only older politicians in Washington DC. In fact, the average age in the US Congress has been climbing for decades and the current Congress is one of the oldest in history. In the early 1980s, the median age of Congress was under 50, but it has been climbing steadily since then to just under 60 today. Politicians are even older in the Senate, where politicians serve longer terms. Around one in five members of Congress are aged 70 or over, but if you look at just the Senate, that rises to about a third of members. Virtually all parliaments around the world are older than the population they represent. You'd expect that: we want people with life and work experience to be making important decisions, and older people tend to have more of that. But the flip side is that many life experiences end up under-represented. For instance, you end up with senior citizens interrogating Silicon Valley moguls about technology platforms that they clearly don't use. \"In general, representative democracy should try to represent their population,\" says Associate Professor Daniel Bessner from the University of Washington. Joe Vogel is a delegate in the US state of Maryland's parliament, the House of Delegates, and says America has changed dramatically since many lawmakers were young. \"We were having these conversations about what mass shooting drills are like in our schools,\" he says.  \"I grew up in a generation where you would sit in a classroom and think of where your hiding spot was or whether you'd have time to run out the door. That is a perspective on these issues that a lot of my colleagues just don't have. \"Many of my colleagues had never lived at a time, had never gone to school at a time when those mass shootings were as common as they are now.\" Joe Vogel, 27, says America has changed dramatically since many US politicians were young. (Supplied: Vogel for Congress) Professor Daniel Stockemer from the University of Ottawa in Canada says a lack of youth representation makes a difference in how parliaments work and what is on the agenda. Campus turmoil and abortion rights have put both Joe Biden and Donald Trump under pressure in another eventful week in US politics, writes Jade Macmillan. \"Young people don't participate that much … one of the reasons is that they are alienated,\" he says. The theory goes that when young people don't participate in elections, they end up less represented in parliament, and that means they become dissatisfied and disinterested in politics. \"We call this the vicious cycle of political alienation,\" Stockemer says. \"If a group is not at the decision-making table, it has very few possibilities to influence policies. \"Just think about gun laws in the US: even young Republicans favour stricter gun laws, young Democrats even more so. \"Older people [in] both parties are more hesitant, and so this is one of the signs that politics is really dominated by older people.\" Stockemer, along with his colleagues, wanted to know more about how many young people were being elected to parliaments around the world. Thousands of hours of work collecting biographical details of parliamentarians led to the creation of the Worldwide Age Representation in Parliaments dataset. He says one thing stood out: \"The US is rather the outlier.\" Europe has some of the youngest parliaments in the world. The United Kingdom, with a median age of 50 in the House of Commons, appears roughly in the middle of the list of countries with relatively complete data. Australia's parliament is a bit older, but the US is in a different league. The United States' outlier status is even more stark when you look at how things have changed over time for the oldest age groups. To look at the over-representation of age groups, Stockemer calculated an \"age representation index\" to compare a group's share of parliament with their share of the population. It shows that people aged 61 or over have rapidly become very over-represented. Most countries are seeing more stability, or where older people are becoming over-represented, it's happening far more slowly. \"But … even stable is no progress,\" Stockemer says. \"If you look at women or minorities ... even if we are far away from parity, we see progress. \"We've seen progress over the past years and decades. For young people, we've seen no progress. If at all, we've seen regression.\" The single biggest contributor to the aging Congress is the aging population. As America has grown older since the baby boom, so have its politicians. It really stands out now, though. Congress has for a long time been about 20 years older than the rest of the country, and that age gap now means a large share of politicians are over the retirement age. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna says she can see that age gap in practice. \"For example, some people talk about press releases and their comms teams, and I'm talking about social media postings, because our generation and generations after me use social media to get our message out there. \"You see it with legislation, with the direction that we run our office in,\" she says. \"And then obviously I had a baby, so we're working on legislation to really change how things run around here.\" Luna was elected in 2022 as the youngest Republican in Congress, with the help of an endorsement from Trump. \"I think [former] President Trump really has an eye for younger talent,\" she says. \"Kudos to [former] President Trump, because had it not been for him, I probably wouldn't be here right now.\" She's also a member of her party's hardline \"Freedom Caucus\", has called herself a \"pro-life extremist\" and believes the 2020 election was stolen. The ABC asked each of the 10 youngest members of Congress for an interview. Luna was the only one to agree. Very much on the other side of the political debate, Joe Vogel isn't in Congress right now, but he wants to be. The 27-year-old was unsuccessful in the Democratic primary election for one of Maryland's congressional districts held in May. Luna and Vogel would probably disagree on almost everything, but not on the role of young people in politics. \"My commitment is to making sure that we have more young folks join in [and] be part of this process,\" Vogel says. Congress may have aged along with the population, but for the representation gap to be this large there must be something else keeping young people out. There's at least one structural factor pushing up the average age a little bit: minimum age limits. You're not allowed to run for the House of Representatives in the US until you turn 25, and you have to be 30 to run for the Senate. Should there also be a maximum age limit? Stockemer thinks it's worth putting on the table. \"There's a retirement age for a lot of people … so we should also ask the question,\" he says. \"We talk about retirement in basically any other field, but not in politics.\" It's actually a popular idea. An overwhelming majority of voters for both parties agree that there should be an age limit for elected officials. But that's easier said than done: instituting age limits in politics would require constitutional change. Daniel Bessner points to a general \"unwillingness to address death\". \"We're not a country that loves thinking about or talking about death. There's a culture of the eternal present in this country, not really in a Zen way,\" he says. \"That certainly leads people, whether you're talking about Strom Thurmond or Dianne Feinstein or Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi, to spend their final years on Earth working incredibly hard in an incredibly difficult position where that would not necessarily have been the case in other cultures.\" Then there are the cultural barriers excluding young people. Luna points to the difficulties people with young families have serving in national office: \"The travel schedule can be pretty harsh … half of the week, every week for the most part, we're up in Washington, DC.\" \"American politics is the last known blood sport. I think that politics around the world can get nasty, but especially here in the states, I feel like it's gotten significantly worse with the rise of social media.\" And that's before you even get elected, she says: \"[You] campaign for two years to get elected. A lot of people can't take time off from work to do that.\" Then there are the views on the maturity or effectiveness of young people in politics that Joe Vogel is keen to dispel. \"The people who sent me here gave me a tremendous opportunity, but it was also a test,\" he says.  \"[They said] 'We want someone with those lived experiences', and now my commitment is to showing the people that sent me here that yes, I can get things done. I've been very committed to demonstrating that young people can be effective and accomplished legislators.\" And then there's the money issue. Running for congress costs a lot, and it's only getting more expensive. On average, winners of congressional seats in 2022 spent about $US2.8 million on their campaigns. The money doesn't usually come directly from the candidate's pocket, but it has to come from somewhere. \"You need to have the connections, the networks,\" Stockemer says. \"It's rather hard for young people to have that.\" Vogel says a lot of his colleagues have other high-paying jobs, or they own businesses or real estate. \"They have other ways to sustain themselves,\" he says. \"I don't have that, right? I have $40,000 of student loan debt that I'm still paying off.\" If you scroll back up and look at the overall average age of American politicians, you'd see that while this congress is one of the oldest on record, the rapid aging in the chamber appears to have been arrested. Take a look at the average age of new members when they first enter congress. Like the overall chamber, we'd seen an aging trend in each freshman class. But it peaked in 2017, and the class of 2023 has a median age of 46.3, the youngest it has been in more than two decades. It could be that we're seeing the beginning of a turning point, but if so, it's not happening quickly. Because once someone is elected, they tend to leave when they're ready, which for most politicians is more than a decade. \"In the US, over 90 per cent of representatives get re-elected from one election to the next,\" Stockemer says. \"And hence, a lot of people, they have their seat and they can stay forever.\" That incumbency advantage is a handbrake on any change, but young politicians hope it is coming. \"Every time I see young folks here in the hallways … I'll take them with me to the house floor and I'll have them sit in those seats with me,\" Vogel says. \"I'll show them how everything works … make them really envision themselves in those settings. \"Because I think when young folks envision themselves in those settings, they start seeing it as possible for them to get engaged and be part of this work.\" Perhaps those efforts are starting to pay off. \"I don't want to do this forever,\" Luna says. \"At that age, I hope that I'm on a Florida beach, nowhere near Washington, DC.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Australia Community and Society Elections Government and Politics US Elections US Elections World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Doug Mills) The indictments — and in some cases, the convictions — of hundreds of people charged with participating in the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, will have to be reconsidered, and possibly dropped, because of a ruling by the US Supreme Court on Friday. Among those charged using a broad interpretation of the obstruction law, now narrowed by the high court, is former president Donald Trump. In its decision, the Supreme Court held that a federal statute that prohibits obstructing an official proceeding may not apply to three defendants who were charged with participating in the US Capitol riot. The earlier decision had allowed a charge of corruptly obstructing an official proceeding — the congressional certification of President Joe Biden's victory over Trump that the rioters sought to prevent — against defendant Joseph Fischer, a former police officer. An explosion caused by a police munition is seen while supporters of Trump riot in front of the US Capitol Building in 2021.  (Reuters: Leah Millis) Although former president Donald Trump is not a defendant in the case, special counsel Jack Smith has charged him separately with violating the same statute. The court, in the decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, took a narrow view of the obstruction statute, saying that prosecutors must show that a defendant \"impaired the availability or integrity\" of documents or other records related to an official proceeding — or attempted to do so. Mr Roberts rejected the Justice Department's more expansive reading of what constitutes obstruction, calling it \"a novel interpretation (that) would criminalise a broad swathe of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists alike to decades in prison\". According to their indictments, Joseph Fischer, Edward Lang and Garret Miller were present at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.  Prosecutors say that all three men entered the Capitol building and assaulted police officers during the riot.  One of the men, Lang, brandished a bat and a stolen police shield, and another, Miller, later called for the assassination of US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on social media. A US flag flies at half-mast outside the Capitol building.  (Reuters: Mike Segar) Federal prosecutors charged the three men with various crimes, including assault on a federal officer, disorderly conduct on the Capitol grounds and obstructing a congressional proceeding.  That last charge is the one at issue in the Supreme Court appeal.  Before trial, the defendants argued that the law the prosecutors had used to charge them with obstruction applied only to evidence tampering, not the violent disruption of a congressional proceeding.  The district court agreed and dismissed the charge, but the US Court of Appeals for the DS Circuit reversed and sent the case back for trial. The Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case, putting the trial on hold while it considered the dispute over the scope of the obstruction law. The Supreme Court's decision does not end the case against the Fischer defendants, who will likely stand trial on their assault and disorderly conduct charges. But it may lead to the dismissal of obstruction charges, or reversal of obstruction convictions, for other January 6 defendants. Defence lawyers for Guy Reffitt, the first January 6 defendant to go to trial, have been ordered to prepare for a re-sentencing. Reffitt was convicted by a jury of five felonies including the obstruction of an official proceeding, and sentenced to seven years and three months. Jacob Chansley, holding the American flag, on the second floor of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. (Reuters: Mike Theiler) The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. Two of the Justice Department's most prominent cases took aim at leaders from the far-right Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. In separate trials, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Proud Boys former chairman Enrique Tarrio, along with their co-conspirators, were convicted of obstructing an official proceeding. Rhodes and Tarrio, as well as some of their co-defendants, were also convicted on other serious felonies such as seditious conspiracy, a Civil War-era law. In cases like this involving multiple felony convictions, legal experts said they do not believe the ruling will lead to drastic changes. One of the first tests of how the ruling could affect defendants in the Oath Keepers case could come as soon as July 26, when Thomas Caldwell will be sentenced. Defendants including Jacob Chansley — also known as also known as the QAnon Shaman — who pleaded guilty solely to obstructing an official proceeding could seek to vacate their sentences, though the Justice Department could then seek to reinstate the other charges that were dropped as part of the plea agreement. The most high-profile defendant facing charges of obstructing an official proceeding is former president Trump. Special counsel Jack Smith is prosecuting Trump in Washington for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In that case, Trump faces four felony counts, two of which involve the obstruction of an official proceeding. But some legal experts say that regardless of the court's ruling, prosecutors still have strong arguments they can use to keep the obstruction charges against Trump alive — namely, that Trump was involved in a conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of votes by getting phoney ballots introduced from slates of \"fake\" electors. Speaking at a campaign rally in Virginia, Trump said his supporters prosecuted for their actions in the attack on the US Capitol should be freed. \"Free the January 6 hostages now. They should free them now for what they have gone through,\" Trump said, as the crowd cheered. \"They've been waiting for this decision for a long time,\" he added.

The 81-year-old president's stumbling, shaky showing against Donald Trump, 78, amplified widely held concerns about his age and acuity.  It's led to despair within the Democratic party, and calls to find a new candidate for the November 5 election. But speaking to a cheering crowd at a campaign rally in North Carolina the following day, Mr Biden gave no indication he was considering moving aside for a younger candidate. \"I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,\" he said. Joe Biden displayed full energy at his first rally after the presidential debate. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz ) \"I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't talk as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. \"But I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. \"And I know, like millions of Americans know, when you get knocked down, you get back up.\" Almost 50 million Americans tuned in to watch the candidates debate in a crowdless TV studio in Atlanta, Georgia, according to preliminary ratings figures.  Trump was also widely criticised, particularly for repeating multiple falsehoods about his record in office, and his opponent's, many of which went unchecked. Vice-President Kamala Harris said Mr Biden had a \"slow start\", but a \"strong finish\". And former president Barack Obama, whom Mr Biden served as vice-president, tweeted \"bad debate nights happen\", but the election remained a choice between someone who tells the truth and someone who lies through their teeth. But the Biden campaign said it raised $US14 million ($21 million) on Thursday and Friday, and posted its single best hour of fundraising immediately after the debate.  The White House said he had a cold and a sore throat. \"I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job. Because quite frankly, the stakes are too high,\" Mr Biden said. Replacing the president as the Democratic candidate for the 2024 election would require his cooperation. That's because every state has now held its primary vote, awarding Mr Biden delegates who are obligated to support him. If Mr Biden chose to stand aside to make way for another candidate, an official decision would need to be made at the Democratic National Convention, which is being held in Chicago on August 19-22. After he left the stage in Atlanta following the debate, he said: \"Let's keep going\".  And campaign spokesman Michael Tyler later said there were no internal conversations about Mr Biden withdrawing. \"We'd rather have one bad night than a candidate with a bad vision for where he wants to take the country,\" he told reporters on Air Force One. At an afternoon rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, Trump told supporters that he had a \"big victory against a man looking to destroy our country\". \"Joe Biden's problem is not his age,\" Trump said. \"It's his competence.\" Donald Trump celebrated his \"big victory\" at a rally in Virginia. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Trump advisers said they thought the debate would bolster their chances in Democratic-leaning states like Virginia, which has not backed a Republican presidential candidate since 2004. Beforehand, some Trump supporters said they were struck by Mr Biden's poor performance. \"I'm scared they are going to replace him and put up somebody more competitive,\" said Mike Boatman, who told Reuters he had attended more than 90 Trump rallies. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. Trump fundraisers said they were fielding enthusiastic calls from donors. \"Anyone who raises money knows there's a time to go to donors, and this is one of those watershed moments,\" said Ed McMullen, who served as ambassador to Switzerland during Trump's presidency. Some analysts say America's allies are now steeling for Trump's re-election. \"The overwhelming feeling from today is that it was a disaster for Biden,\" said Peter Dean, a professor at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney, after attending a \"Trump 2.0\" workshop with Australian officials. \"The mood has changed considerably after the debate and the general view is that if you weren’t preparing for a Trump 2.0 then, that is the smart play and the smart move now.\" The candidates are scheduled to debate again in September, and the Biden campaign said that plan had not changed.

(AP: Scott Applewhite/Gerald Herbert/Jacquelyn Martin) How old is too old to be president? As Americans gear up to vote in this year's presidential election, it's a question that's been on a lot of people's minds. Especially as the two oldest candidates to ever run for office in the US are running again — breaking the record for the oldest two people to ever compete for the presidency that they set four years ago. Opinion polling has routinely found that voters don't like this, with more people worried about Joe Biden's age than Donald Trump's. A February Ipsos poll found 59 per cent of voters thought both candidates were too old. A New York Times/Siena poll found nearly half of voters thought Biden was too old to handle the job of president. If successful, Biden would be 82 years old at the start of his second term, four years older than Trump, who would be 78. These concerns were amplified in the wake of Friday's presidential debate, during which Biden appeared frail, spoke quietly and seemed to lose his train of thought. But here's the thing: Biden and Trump are not the only older politicians in Washington DC. In fact, the average age in the US Congress has been climbing for decades and the current Congress is one of the oldest in history. In the early 1980s, the median age of Congress was under 50, but it has been climbing steadily since then to just under 60 today. Politicians are even older in the Senate, where politicians serve longer terms. Around one in five members of Congress are aged 70 or over, but if you look at just the Senate, that rises to about a third of members. Virtually all parliaments around the world are older than the population they represent. You'd expect that: we want people with life and work experience to be making important decisions, and older people tend to have more of that. But the flip side is that many life experiences end up under-represented. For instance, you end up with senior citizens interrogating Silicon Valley moguls about technology platforms that they clearly don't use. \"In general, representative democracy should try to represent their population,\" says Associate Professor Daniel Bessner from the University of Washington. Joe Vogel is a delegate in Maryland's state parliament, the House of Delegates, and says America has changed dramatically since many lawmakers were young. \"We were having these conversations about what mass shooting drills are like in our schools,\" he says.  \"I grew up in a generation where you would sit in a classroom and think of where your hiding spot was or whether you'd have time to run out the door. That is a perspective on these issues that a lot of my colleagues just don't have. \"Many of my colleagues had never lived at a time, had never gone to school at a time when those mass shootings were as common as they are now.\"' Joe Vogel, 27, says America has changed dramatically since many US politicians were young. (Supplied: Vogel for Congress) Professor Daniel Stockemer from the University of Ottawa says a lack of youth representation makes a difference in how parliaments work and what is on the agenda. Campus turmoil and abortion rights have put both Joe Biden and Donald Trump under pressure in another eventful week in US politics, writes Jade Macmillan. \"Young people don't participate that much … one of the reasons is that they are alienated,\" he says. The theory goes that when young people don't participate in elections, they end up less represented in parliament, and that means they become dissatisfied and disinterested in politics. \"We call this the vicious cycle of political alienation,\" Stockemer says. \"If a group is not at the decision-making table, it has very few possibilities to influence policies. \"Just think about gun laws in the US: even young Republicans favour stricter gun laws, young Democrats even more so. \"Older people [in] both parties are more hesitant, and so this is one of the signs that politics is really dominated by older people.\" Stockemer, along with his colleagues, wanted to know more about how many young people were being elected to parliaments around the world. Thousands of hours of work collecting biographical details of parliamentarians led to the creation of the Worldwide Age Representation in Parliaments dataset. He says one thing stood out: \"The US is rather the outlier.\" Europe has some of the youngest parliaments in the world. The United Kingdom, with a median age of 50 in the House of Commons, appears roughly in the middle of the list of countries with relatively complete data. Australia's parliament is a bit older, but the US is in a different league. The United States' outlier status is even more stark when you look at how things have changed over time for the oldest age groups. To look at the over-representation of age groups, Stockemer calculated an \"age representation index\" to compare a group's share of parliament with their share of the population. It shows that people aged 61 or over have rapidly become very over-represented. Most countries are seeing more stability, or where older people are becoming over-represented, it's happening far more slowly. \"But … even stable is no progress,\" Stockemer says. \"If you look at women or minorities ... even if we are far away from parity, we see progress. \"We've seen progress over the past years and decades. For young people, we've seen no progress. If at all, we've seen regression.\" The single biggest contributor to the aging Congress is the aging population. As America has grown older since the baby boom, so have its politicians. It really stands out now, though. Congress has for a long time been about 20 years older than the rest of the country, and that age gap now means a large share of politicians are over the retirement age. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna says she can see that age gap in practice. \"For example, some people talk about press releases and their comms teams, and I'm talking about social media postings, because our generation and generations after me use social media to get our message out there. \"You see it with legislation, with the direction that we run our office in,\" she says. \"And then obviously I had a baby, so we're working on legislation to really change how things run around here.\" Luna was elected in 2022 as the youngest Republican in Congress, with the help of an endorsement from Trump. \"I think [former] President Trump really has an eye for younger talent,\" she says. \"Kudos to [former] President Trump, because had it not been for him, I probably wouldn't be here right now.\" She's also a member of her party's hardline \"Freedom Caucus\", has called herself a \"pro-life extremist\" and believes the 2020 election was stolen. The ABC asked each of the 10 youngest members of Congress for an interview. Luna was the only one to agree. Very much on the other side of the political debate, Joe Vogel isn't in Congress right now, but he wants to be. The 27-year-old was unsuccessful in the Democratic primary election for one of Maryland's congressional districts held in May. Luna and Vogel would probably disagree on almost everything, but not on the role of young people in politics. \"My commitment is to making sure that we have more young folks join in [and] be part of this process,\" Vogel says. Congress may have aged along with the population, but for the representation gap to be this large there must be something else keeping young people out. There's at least one structural factor pushing up the average age a little bit: minimum age limits. You're not allowed to run for the House of Representatives in the US until you turn 25, and you have to be 30 to run for the Senate. Should there also be a maximum age limit? Stockemer thinks it's worth putting on the table. \"There's a retirement age for a lot of people … so we should also ask the question,\" he says. \"We talk about retirement in basically any other field, but not in politics.\" It's actually a popular idea. An overwhelming majority of voters for both parties agree that there should be an age limit for elected officials. But that's easier said than done: instituting age limits in politics would require constitutional change. Daniel Bessner points to a general \"unwillingness to address death\". \"We're not a country that loves thinking about or talking about death. There's a culture of the eternal present in this country, not really in a Zen way,\" he says. \"That certainly leads people, whether you're talking about Strom Thurmond or Dianne Feinstein or Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi, to spend their final years on Earth working incredibly hard in an incredibly difficult position where that would not necessarily have been the case in other cultures.\" Then there are the cultural barriers excluding young people. Luna points to the difficulties people with young families have serving in national office: \"The travel schedule can be pretty harsh … half of the week, every week for the most part, we're up in Washington, DC.\" \"American politics is the last known blood sport. I think that politics around the world can get nasty, but especially here in the states, I feel like it's gotten significantly worse with the rise of social media.\" And that's before you even get elected, she says: \"[You] campaign for two years to get elected. A lot of people can't take time off from work to do that.\" Then there are the views on the maturity or effectiveness of young people in politics that Joe Vogel is keen to dispel. \"The people who sent me here gave me a tremendous opportunity, but it was also a test,\" he says.  \"[They said] 'We want someone with those lived experiences', and now my commitment is to showing the people that sent me here that yes, I can get things done. I've been very committed to demonstrating that young people can be effective and accomplished legislators.\" And then there's the money issue. Running for congress costs a lot, and it's only getting more expensive. On average, winners of congressional seats in 2022 spent about $US2.8 million on their campaigns. The money doesn't usually come directly from the candidate's pocket, but it has to come from somewhere. \"You need to have the connections, the networks,\" Stockemer says. \"It's rather hard for young people to have that.\" Vogel says a lot of his colleagues have other high-paying jobs, or they own businesses or real estate. \"They have other ways to sustain themselves,\" he says. \"I don't have that, right? I have $40,000 of student loan debt that I'm still paying off.\" If you scroll back up and look at the overall average age of American politicians, you'd see that while this congress is one of the oldest on record, the rapid aging in the chamber appears to have been arrested. Take a look at the average age of new members when they first enter congress. Like the overall chamber, we'd seen an aging trend in each freshman class. But it peaked in 2017, and the class of 2023 has a median age of 46.3, the youngest it has been in more than two decades. It could be that we're seeing the beginning of a turning point, but if so, it's not happening quickly. Because once someone is elected, they tend to leave when they're ready, which for most politicians is more than a decade. \"In the US, over 90 per cent of representatives get re-elected from one election to the next,\" Stockemer says. \"And hence, a lot of people, they have their seat and they can stay forever.\" That incumbency advantage is a handbrake on any change, but young politicians hope it is coming. \"Every time I see young folks here in the hallways … I'll take them with me to the house floor and I'll have them sit in those seats with me,\" Vogel says. \"I'll show them how everything works … make them really envision themselves in those settings. \"Because I think when young folks envision themselves in those settings, they start seeing it as possible for them to get engaged and be part of this work.\" Perhaps those efforts are starting to pay off. \"I don't want to do this forever,\" Luna says. \"At that age, I hope that I'm on a Florida beach, nowhere near Washington, DC.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Community and Society Elections US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Top US Democrats have ruled out the possibility of replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee after a feeble debate performance and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of a second Donald Trump presidency. After days of hand-wringing about Mr Biden's poor night on stage debating Mr Trump, Democratic leaders firmly rejected calls for their party to choose a younger presidential candidate for the November 5 election. Mr Biden, 81, meanwhile, was huddling with family members at the Camp David presidential retreat on Sunday. A number of op-eds over the weekend have called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race.  (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) The New York Times cited people close to the situation as saying that Mr Biden's family was urging him to stay in the race and keep fighting.  The paper said some members of his clan privately expressed exasperation at how his staff prepared him for Thursday night's event. A drumbeat of calls for Mr Biden to step aside has continued since Thursday and a post-debate CBS poll showed a 10-point jump in the number of Democrats who believe Biden should not be running for president, to 46 per cent from 36 per cent in February. \"The unfortunate truth is that Biden should withdraw from the race, for the good of the nation he has served so admirably for half a century,\" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said in an editorial on Sunday.  \"The shade of retirement is now necessary for President Biden.\" Georgia Democratic senator Raphael Warnock, one of several Democrats seen as a possible replacement for Mr Biden, said the president should \"absolutely not\" step down. In the lead-up to the US election, many are concerned that Biden and Trump, the two oldest people to ever run for office in the US, are running again. It's indicative of a broader issue — the average age of the US congress has been climbing for decades. \"Bad debates happen,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press program. \"The question is, 'Who has Donald Trump ever shown up for other than himself and people like himself?' I'm with Joe Biden, and it's our assignment to make sure that he gets over the finish line come November.\" House of Representatives Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who could become speaker next year if his party can take control of the House in November, acknowledged that Mr Biden had suffered a setback, but this was \"nothing more than a set-up for a comeback\". \"So the moment that we're in right now is a comeback moment,\" he told MSNBC. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a leading Biden surrogate, told ABC's This Week program Mr Biden needed to stay in the race to ensure Mr Trump's defeat. \"I think he's the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump,\" Mr Coons said. With Democratic leaders rallying around him, it will be up to Mr Biden to decide whether he wants to end his re-election bid. But other Democrats held open the possibility of choosing a different presidential candidate. Representative Jamie Raskin, a prominent Democrat in congress, told MSNBC that \"very honest and serious and rigorous conversations\" were taking place within the party. \"Whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he's going to be the keynote speaker at our convention,\" Mr Raskin said.  \"He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward.\"  Representative Jamie Raskin said serious discussions were being held by the Democrats.  (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein) During the debate, a hoarse-sounding Mr Biden delivered a shaky, halting performance in which he stumbled over his words on several occasions. Some Democrats later said privately that the showing could prove to be a disqualifying factor. For his part in the debate, Mr Trump made a series of well-worn falsehoods, including claims that migrants have carried out a crime wave, that Democrats support infanticide and that he actually won the 2020 election. Mr Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, told Fox News that Mr Trump was feeling \"great\" after \"probably the best debate of his political career\". Mr Biden headed to Camp David after a frenzied run of seven campaign events across four states following the debate. While the Camp David trip had been planned for months, the timing and circumstances of Mr Biden being surrounded by family members who have weighed heavily in his past decisions to run for the presidency have added to the scrutiny around the visit. The Biden family spent the weekend at the Camp David retreat.  (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Two people familiar with the scheduling said the gathering would include a family photo shoot.  The attendees include his wife Jill, as well as the Biden children and grandchildren. The New York Times said one of the strongest voices imploring Mr Biden to resist pressure to drop out was his son Hunter, who on June 11 became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a felony after a jury found him guilty of lying about illegal drug use when he purchased a handgun in 2018. DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country, a group of some of the most-influential members of the party. The call was part pep talk, part planning meeting for the upcoming national convention, according to two people who were on the call who requested anonymity to discuss private discussions.

Long-time Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon has been taken into custody after surrendering at a federal prison to begin a four-month sentence on contempt charges for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the US Capitol attack. Bannon arrived at the Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut on Monday, local time, the Bureau of Prisons said. Speaking to reporters, Bannon called himself a \"political prisoner\" and said Trump was \"very supportive\" of him. The US Supreme Court has raised the legal bar for prosecutors pursuing obstruction charges in the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump and defendants involved in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. He also slammed Democrats, including Attorney-General Merrick Garland. \"I am proud of going to prison,\" Bannon said, adding he was \"standing up to the Garland corrupt DOJ\". Shortly before he arrived to surrender, a small group of supporters gathered on the side of the road outside the prison.  They cheered as Bannon and GOP Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke during a news conference, holding up flags and signs supporting Bannon. A small group of protesters shouted, \"Lock him up!\" and \"traitor!\" Police had to stop traffic to allow the black SUV Bannon was riding in to pull out of a church parking lot where Bannon's supporters had gathered. A judge had allowed Bannon to stay free for nearly two years while he appealed but ordered him to report to prison on Monday after an appeals court panel upheld his contempt of Congress convictions.  The Supreme Court on Friday rejected his last-minute appeal to stave off his sentence. The rowdy crowd cheered on Steven Bannon, often breaking into chants of, \"USA!\"  (AP Photo: Julia Nikhinson) A jury found Bannon guilty of two misdemeanour counts of contempt of Congress; one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the January 6 attack House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. Defence lawyers have argued the case raises issues that should be examined by the Supreme Court, including Bannon's previous lawyer's belief that the subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege.  Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee. Bannon's appeal will continue to play out, and Republican House leaders have put their support behind stepping in to assert the January 6 committee was improperly created, effectively trying to deem the subpoena Bannon received as illegitimate. Another Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, has also been convicted of contempt of Congress.  He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence after the Supreme Court refused his bid to delay the sentence. Bannon is also facing criminal charges in New York state court alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.  Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges, and that trial has been postponed until at least the end of September. Trump had previously pardoned Bannon, his former chief strategist, in the final hours of his White House term as part of a flurry of clemency action. Bannon had been charged federally with duping thousands of donors who believed their money would be used to fulfil Trump's chief campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border.  Instead, prosecutors alleged he diverted over a million dollars, paying a salary to one campaign official and personal expenses for himself.  His co-defendants were not pardoned.

America's highest court found ex-presidents have significant protection from criminal prosecution — a historic ruling that could have major ramifications for Trump's criminal conviction, as well as his other criminal cases currently before other courts. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records, arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment just before the 2016 presidential election.  His lawyers wrote to the New York judge who oversaw the jury trial, citing the Supreme Court's ruling on Monday, and asked for a delay in the sentencing to consider the decision.  He is scheduled to be sentenced in the hush money case on July 11. Trump claimed he'd had a \"big win\" when the ruling was announced, though the Supreme Court has not spelled out exactly how its decision affects his ongoing legal woes. It has instead left that for a lower court to work out.  But the decision creates a major hurdle for prosecutors who have charged Trump with unlawful attempts to overturn the 2020 election result. The federal trial has almost no chance of going ahead before the November 5 election. The delay in itself is a win for Trump. The Supreme Court was divided along ideological lines. Three Trump-appointed justices joined three other conservatives to hand down a 6-3 majority ruling.  But the court's other three justices warned the decision could lead to \"nightmare scenarios\" where presidents could carry out military coups or order political assassinations without fear of prosecution. Chief Justice John Roberts rejected the dissenters' \"tone of chilling doom\", finding presidents had \"absolute immunity\" for \"official acts\" carried out while in office, but \"no immunity for unofficial acts\". Trump posted on social media:  \"Big win for our constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American!\" For the first time in history, the Supreme Court has ruled that former presidents are protected from criminal prosecution for some – but not all – of what they do in office. Basically, anything that falls within their official job duties is protected. Chief Justice John Roberts, explaining the majority ruling, wrote: \"Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. \"And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.\" He said the president \"is not above the law\", but: \"Congress may not criminalise the president's conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.\" Donald Trump faces three criminal cases (and he's due to be sentenced next week in a fourth, for falsifying business records over hush money paid to a porn star). You can get caught up on all of the cases here. Donald Trump has been found guilty in a hush money trial, but his legal woes are far from over. As he continues his bid to retake the White House, here’s a status update on his other court cases. The decision on Monday, local time, is a potentially huge blow to one of them: a federal case alleging he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Under four criminal counts, he is accused of: In fighting the allegations, Trump's lawyers had argued he shouldn't be prosecuted because a president has \"absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the outer perimeter of his official duties\". Two lower courts rejected that argument, but Trump's lawyers wanted the Supreme Court to take it up, which it ultimately agreed to do. The decision will further delay the case, which had been scheduled to start in March this year. And it could completely derail it. The delay means there is almost no chance it will proceed to trial before the November 5 election.  A lower court will now need to determine which parts of the case can go ahead, and which parts should be struck out – in other words, which of Trump's alleged actions would have been \"official acts\" immune from prosecution, and which are not \"official acts\". As it often is, the conservative-majority court was divided along partisan lines. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein, file) Although the Supreme Court stopped short of making those decisions, it did offer some specific guidance.  It found he had complete immunity for discussions with Justice Department officials, effectively leaving that part of the case against him in tatters. It also found he was \"presumptively immune\" for his interactions with Mr Pence. \"There's no other way to put it — this case is a major win for Donald Trump,\" says Claire Wofford, a political scientist at the College of Charleston who specialises in the US legal system. \"What I see, bottom line, is a very narrow path for this prosecution to go forward.\" One of the justices went even further than the others, potentially creating another roadblock for the prosecution. Justice Clarence Thomas — who has attracted recent controversy over revelations he's accepted travel and gifts from big Republican donors — issued a separate opinion, questioning prosecutor Jack Smith's appointment to the role of \"special counsel\" to run the Trump case. He argued that role was not recognised under law, and Mr Smith was therefore just a \"private citizen\". \"A private citizen cannot criminally prosecute anyone, let alone a former president.\" None of the other justices signed on to that opinion, but it could give a lower court a basis for challenging Mr Smith's authority to prosecute Trump. The ruling leaves many practical questions unanswered.  But some legal experts — including the three Supreme Court justices who opposed the majority decision — say the ruling gives any future president largely unfettered power to commit crime without accountability. Some fear that will inevitably lead to corruption in the Oval Office. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned: \"To the extent that the majority’s new accountability paradigm allows Presidents to evade punishment for their criminal acts while in office, the seeds of absolute power for Presidents have been planted. And, without a doubt, absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" And Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissenting judgement backed by two of the other justices, warned it elevates the president to \"a king above the law\". \"When [the president] uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organises a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\" Dr Wofford says the significance of the ruling ultimately depends on who is elected president in future. \"If, as many people fear, Donald Trump is just the first of many presidents who will go on and try to seize power and become more and more autocratic, then the ramifications of today's decision are hard to understate,\" she says.  In a series of social media posts, Trump said the \"brilliantly written and wise\" decision \"should end all of Crooked Joe Biden's witch hunts\".  \"Many of these fake cases will now disappear, or wither into obscurity,\" he predicted. Later, President Joe Biden held an evening press conference to blast the court for setting a dangerous precedent that meant \"there are virtually no limits on what the president can do\". \"This decision today has continued the court's attack in recent years on a wide range of long-established legal principles in our nation, from gutting voting rights and civil rights, to taking away a woman's right to choose, to today's decision that undermines the rule of law of this nation,\" the president said. The matter will return to US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan. She will have to decide which parts of the case can stand, and which parts will need to be thrown out. The timeline is unclear, but Dr Wofford warns: \"I can say with 100 per cent certainty you're not going to see a quick resolution of this case in any way, shape, or form.\" The judge will need to give both sides an opportunity to file briefs, and they may need to argue in front of her in person in Washington DC, Dr Wofford says. If Trump is elected president on November 5, he has indicated he will make sweeping new appointments across the government, including in the Justice Department, who would likely drop the case. He could also potentially pardon himself. \"Come November, if President Trump is re-elected the president of the United States, these charges go away,\" Dr Wofford says.  \"And that's the end of it right there.\" ABC/AP Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Jade Macmillan Topic:World Politics Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Patrick Samanksy) An article in Vanity Fair alleged that Robert F Kennedy Jr sexually assaulted a former family babysitter in the late 1990s. Mr Kennedy told a podcast he was \"not a church boy\" and had \"so many skeletons in my closet\" when asked about the allegation. He is running as an independent candidate against Democrat Joe Biden and Republican contender Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has responded to an allegation he sexually assaulted a former family babysitter, saying he has \"so many skeletons in my closet\". Mr Kennedy, often referred to by his initials as RFK Jr, made the comments on a podcast on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published an article detailing the sexual assault allegation. The article said that in 1998 RFK Jr and his then-wife Mary Richardson hired 23-year-old Eliza Cooney as their live-in babysitter. Robert F Kennedy Jr announced his entry to the 2024 presidential race as an independent candidate after initially challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. (Reuters: Mark Makela) Ms Cooney told the magazine that Mr Kennedy touched her leg during a business meeting, appeared shirtless in her bedroom asking her to rub lotion on his back and groped her in the family kitchen. She said she kept the alleged assault secret until the #MeToo movement began in 2017, when she told her mother. Ms Cooney told two close friends and a lawyer in 2023 when Mr Kennedy announced his presidential campaign. When asked about Ms Cooney's allegations, Mr Kennedy said, \"I am not a church boy.\" \"I had a very, very rambunctious youth,\" he told podcaster Saagar Enjeti. \"I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\" When pressed if he denied the sexual assault allegation, Mr Kennedy said, \"I'm not going to comment on it.\" Robert F Kennedy Jr struggled with memory loss and brain fog so severe his friends were concerned he had a tumour. Instead, he says, doctors found a parasite.  The article also spoke of RFK Jr's struggles with addiction in his youth, a \"sex diary\" leaked to the New York Post in 2013 but which Mr Kennedy denies keeping and his anti-scientific claims about vaccines, among other controversies. He denied a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal — which Vanity Fair said appeared to be a dog — belonged to a canine. He said it was the carcass of a goat. Vanity Fair said Mr Kennedy texted the photo to a friend last year, saying the friend might enjoy a restaurant in Korea that served dog on the menu. \"Hey @VanityFair,\" RFK Jr wrote on social media platform X, \"you know when your veterinary experts call a goat a dog, and your forensic experts say a photo taken in Patagonia was taken in Korea, that you've joined the ranks of supermarket tabloids.\" The article said the digital file's metadata showed that the photo was taken in 2010, the same year Mr Kennedy was diagnosed with a parasite in his brain. He has since fully recovered, his campaign has said. The details of the photograph have not been independently confirmed. Vanity Fair said it spoke to Kennedy family members and friends on and off the record for the article, and that behind the scenes some of his siblings were \"furious\" over his candidacy. \"I've spoken to Bobby about this race, about what's at stake, about the importance of supporting Joe Biden, of the impact of the Trump presidency on our country and on the world,\" his sister Kerry Kennedy told the magazine. \"And I was clearly unpersuasive.\" RFK Jr ditched decades of Kennedy family allegiance to the Democratic Party when he announced his independent run for the White House. It can be hard to get a handle on Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of JFK, but one thing's for sure: his bid for the White House can't be easily dismissed. He is the nephew of assassinated Democratic president John F Kennedy and the son of US attorney general and New York senator Robert F Kennedy, who was also assassinated when running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. RFK Jr said at the time of announcing his run as an independent candidate that it was \"very painful\" to separate from the party of his political family dynasty, but that Americans deserved an alternative to the two-party system. He originally challenged Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, but announced just months later he was running as an independent. He has been called a potential election \"spoiler\" by standing to take votes away from both major-party candidates, Mr Biden and the Republican contender Donald Trump. While it's difficult for outside candidates to garner enough support to take on the established parties, they can peel off enough for votes from one candidate to give their opponent victory. The former environmental lawyer is polling at a 9 per cent average, according to American political analysis website 538.

(Supplied: Brian Firebaugh) With his oversized straw hat and bushranger beard, Brian Firebaugh is perhaps the least likely person you'd expect to be a TikTok sensation. The first-generation longhorn cattle rancher was catapulted to internet stardom from the paddocks of his property in central Texas. \"Howdy y'all, my name's Cattle Guy,\" Brian shouts in his southern twang, greeting his half a million followers before launching into another lesson on life on the land. His account takes users to the cattle yards of the southern US, where he explains everything from snake spit to hay prices to city folk who may never set foot in the country. But Brian stands to lose a lot more than his global following should the US government's attempt to ban the booming app go ahead and lock out America's 170 million users. Brian Firebaugh overcame homelessness and addiction before buying a ranch and becoming a TikTok star. (Supplied: Brian Firebaugh) The 42-year-old credits TikTok with delivering him a new source of livelihood, a powerful marketing tool, a winning place on a Netflix reality TV series and, incredibly, his adopted son. \"This app has been monstrous for us … it's drastically changed my life,\" he said. \"People look at my videos and say, 'Hey, I really like that cow, is she for sale?' … So the success of our business is driven off TikTok. \"To do it away, man you're taking food off my table and I have a problem with that.\" Brian Firebaugh travelled to Washington DC to protest the ban. (Reuters: Craig Hudson) Now he and seven other TikTok creators are suing the US government over its attempt to ban the app from US devices — a move Brian describes as an \"egregious\" violation of First Amendment rights to free speech. \"If you ever have politicians that want to take your rights away under the cloak of national security, and they do it so swiftly that they don't give you time to fight it, that should raise everyone's eyebrows,\" he said. America is home to 170 million TikTok users — the platform's largest global market. (Reuters: Magali Druscovich) Once written off as a corner-of-the-internet home to dancing teens, TikTok has evolved into one of the most popular, distrusted, geopolitically complex juggernauts to enter the mainstream. The app's explosive ascent has reshaped popular culture and modern life, and deepened tensions between the world's two biggest superpowers. A report by Oxford Economics, commissioned by TikTok, says it also contributed $US24.2 billion to the American economy last year. And now, it's triggered a set of complex legal battles that will pit Americans' fiercely protected right to free speech against concerns for national security. Legislation to ban the world's most popular social media app was featured as a footnote in a multi-billion-dollar foreign aid package passed by members of Congress in April. Its passing signalled a rare feat for an institution chronically unable to agree on the most basic of legislation. ByteDance is a private Chinese tech company that owns TikTok and other video sharing apps. (Reuters: Thomas Suen) Concerns for national security have cast a shadow of distrust over the Chinese social media app, owned by tech giant ByteDance — a private company based in Beijing with numerous global investors. Many US politicians view the app as a potential vehicle for mass surveillance and covert propaganda by its global adversary — a Trojan horse for Chinese influence. While evidence of these claims has been scant, a 2023 study found sensitive political subjects that the Chinese government might seek to suppress, such as Taiwan, Tibet and Tiananmen Square, were largely missing from TikTok compared to apps like Instagram. TikTok argues such analysis is misleading and that the app is much newer compared to other social media platforms. But a former ByteDance executive has also alleged the company's Beijing offices have a special unit of Chinese Community Party members tasked with guiding \"how the company advanced core Communist values\". Joe Biden announced the bill as part of a $US95 billion foreign aid package. (AP: Evan Vucci) President Joe Biden, who has an account on TikTok, signed the law into effect earlier this year, sparking outrage among users who account for roughly half the American population and the app's biggest global market. By signing the bill, the president issued TikTok an ultimatum: sell the app to a US competitor by January 2025, or watch it disappear from app stores on millions of devices across the country. The move marked a significant shift in decades of policy that favoured an open, free and interoperable internet, said Tim Edgar, a Harvard University law lecturer and professor of computer science with Brown University. \"The golden age of US tech where US tech companies dominated the globe is starting to come to an end,\" he said. \"Here we have Congress not regulating the tech industry to protect privacy, but instead singling out a single company and basically saying, 'We don't like you because you're Chinese'.\" TikTok's dominance is staggering. A 2024 study found TikTok usage has now eclipsed all other social platforms, with the average American user spending at least an hour per day on the app. And it's no wonder. TikTok's secret sauce lies in its sophisticated algorithm that can gobble up hours of attention among even the most disciplined users. A New York creator hosts a TikTok livestream about the news of the day from their bedroom. (Reuters: Magali Druscovich) As Americans' trust for mainstream news has been in steady decline, TikTok's role as a news source has climbed. Today the app stands as the number one news source for young Americans — many of whom will be headed to the polls to vote in November's presidential election.  This has not gone unnoticed by the Biden and Trump campaign teams, who have both sought to use TikTok to bridge the divide between young Americans and the two geriatric candidates. While Biden's administration has been busy courting social media influencers, his TikTok account features posts of an apparently agile aviator-wearing president. And despite his own attempts to axe the platform while in office, Trump's recent debut on TikTok depicts a strongman arriving to rapturous applause at a boxing match. In April, ByteDance bit back when it released a statement that made clear it had no intention of selling the app or its algorithm. \"Foreign media reports of ByteDance selling TikTok are not true. ByteDance doesn't have any plan to sell TikTok,\" the company said. Instead, the social media giant has launched legal action against the US government for what its CEO Shou Chew has described as an \"obviously unconstitutional\" ban. Testifying before Congress in March, Mr Chew stressed that ByteDance \"is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government\" and does not share its data with the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok's CEO Shou Chew was hauled before Congress for a grilling over his suspected links to China. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) The five-hour grilling before a US House committee hearing saw the Singaporean-based CEO interrogated over his suspected links to China as some senators invited ridicule after referring to TikTok as Tic Tac — a brand of breath mints. Mr Chew pointed to an initiative known as Project Texas, which TikTok implemented to ensure data collected from American users was stored by a US company on US soil. But the $US1.5billion project wasn't enough to assuage US officials' concerns for privacy and child safety. TikTok has also since disclosed that, in 2022, the company offered the US government the power to shut down the platform's US operations via a \"kill switch\" in a further attempt to address national security concerns. Back on the ranch and miles from Congress, Brian Firebaugh has been busy preparing for a brutal summer. He credits TikTok with keeping his cattle business afloat during years of punishing drought. Having served in the US Marines, Brian said he was diagnosed with PTSD and a traumatic brain injury which led him to homelessness and severe alcohol addiction. He eventually sought treatment and saved enough money to buy a small ranch where he began making TikToks. Brian Firebaugh and his wife had long wanted to adopt a child. (Supplied: Brian Firebaugh) His videos grew so popular he became eligible for the TikTok rewards program which sees US creators paid as much as $US1,000 per million views on high-performing content. His online presence caught the attention of a Netflix producer who enquired about Brian appearing on a TV series named The Trust — a reality game show set at a seaside mansion. \"At first I said I have no interest in being on a reality TV show — I run a ranch,\" he said. But then he learned about the \"life-changing sums of money\" at stake. He and his wife April had long wanted to adopt their first child but had not been eligible due to Brian's unreliable income as a rancher amid years of volatile climate conditions. \"I went on there so I could win that thing so we could adopt this little baby boy,\" he said. Brian won the Netflix reality series in March, taking home tens of thousands in prize money. Brian with wife April and son Rooster at home in Texas. (Supplied: Brian Firebaugh) With the additional cash, Brian said adoption authorities approved him and his wife to adopt a child. By April, they were introduced to their new little boy, nicknamed \"Baby Rooster\". \"He was three pounds with fiery red hair sticking up in a mohawk,\" Brian recalled with a grin. \"He owns my smile now.\" TikTok creator Talia Cadet posts video reviews of Black-owned businesses and products. (Supplied: Talia Cadet) Talia Cadet is another TikToker who joined the legal action to stop a ban that she said would \"decimate\" the online community, which follows her for book reviews and recommendations in the nation's capital. \"We're talking about people's livelihoods, and people's ability to connect with others that look and live like them, to find people they see themselves in. People who are otherwise silenced,\" she said. Talia said the government had not provided any concrete evidence to substantiate its claims of national security concerns, and until that happened, she would not be satisfied. \"If data and privacy is such a concern, let's see sweeping legislation for all current and future apps to abide by,\" she said. Members of Congress heard similar grievances firsthand from angry TikTokers when the app prompted them to contact their local representatives over the matter — inundating congressional offices with a deluge of calls. But, Professor Edgar said, this \"clumsy\" display of advocacy ultimately backfired as it supported the view that TikTok wields too much power over domestic politics. TikTok creators protested outside Congress earlier this year. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein) In an effort to reframe the situation, the White House has told reporters the law is \"not about a ban, it's about divestment\". If it were to sell, the app's non-Chinese investors are rumoured to have expressed interest in buying the app, which is valued in excess of $US100 billion by some estimates. Professor Edgar anticipates the Chinese government could block the sale of the app, should it come to that. If it were to be banned, the app wouldn't disappear from phones straight away, but would instead be removed from app stores on US devices. This would result in the departure of investors and advertisers, along with a gradual decline in user experience. Until then, legal cases will be fought in the court system with ByteDance expected to lean heavily on the constitution's First Amendment. \"Any law that impacts a fundamental right, like freedom of expression, must serve a compelling governmental interest and it has to be narrowly tailored to serve that interest,\" Professor Edgar said. \"That means [the government must prove] there aren't other less restrictive ways of achieving the government's goals. And I think they may have trouble with both of those.\" The US Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in ByteDance's legal challenge against the US legislation in September with a ruling expected by early December. The challenge has been consolidated with the action brought by TikTok users. If the court upholds the law, ByteDance has until January 19 to divest or be banned.

(Reuters: Charly Triballeau/Pool) Donald Trump was due to be sentenced in his hush-money case next week, but it has been postponed by at least two months so the judge can consider a new request from Trump's lawyers. Trump's legal team wants the opportunity to argue the conviction should be overturned because of this week's Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. Judge Juan Merchan will rule on the request on September 6, with sentencing pencilled in for September 18. A New York judge has delayed Donald Trump's sentencing for criminal conduct until September at the earliest, after the former US president asked for a chance to argue he should have been immune from prosecution. The former president's sentencing, for falsifying business records to disguise hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, had been set for July 11. But it faces potential complications after the US Supreme Court ruled on Monday, local time, that ex-presidents have some immunity from criminal prosecution in some circumstances. The postponement delays the sentencing until at least September 18, well after this month's Republican National Convention, where Trump is set formally to accept the party's nomination for president in this year's race. There was no immediate comment from Trump's campaign or Manhattan prosecutors, who brought the case. The court ruling on Monday granted broad immunity protections to presidents for \"official acts\" carried out during their term in office. It also restricts prosecutors from citing any \"official acts\" as evidence in trying to prove a president's \"unofficial acts\" violated the law. Hours after it was issued, Trump's lawyers requested that New York Judge Juan Merchan set aside the jury's guilty verdict and delay the sentencing to consider how the ruling could affect the hush-money case. The judge wrote that he would rule on September 6, and the next date in the case would be September 18 \"if such is still necessary\". Trump's legal team has argued that Manhattan prosecutors placed \"highly prejudicial emphasis on official-acts evidence\", including Trump's social media posts and witness testimony about meetings at the White House. Prosecutors said before the judge's ruling that they believed those arguments were \"without merit\" but that they would not oppose adjourning the sentencing for two weeks as the judge considered the matter. In May, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from an attempt to cover up a $US130,000 ($195,000) hush-money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Stormy Daniels gave a graphic account of a sexual encounter with Trump during her testimony at the New York hush money trial. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 after meeting him at a celebrity golf tournament. Trump has repeatedly denied that claim, saying at last week's debate with President Joe Biden: \"I didn't have sex with a porn star.\" Prosecutors said the Daniels payment was part of a broader scheme to buy the silence of people who might have gone public during the campaign with embarrassing stories alleging he had extramarital sex. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels and was later reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years behind bars, though legal experts say the maximum sentence is highly unlikely in Trump's case. Other potential penalties include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge, which would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment. Trump is the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime.

(AP Photo: Jose Luis Magana, file) Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, federal prosecutor and legal adviser to Donald Trump, has been disbarred in New York after a court found he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. Mr Giuliani actively contributed to the fallout following the 2020 presidential election, the court said. He is facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, federal prosecutor and legal adviser to Donald Trump, has been disbarred in New York after a court found he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. On Tuesday, local time, the Manhattan appeals court ruled Mr Giuliani, who had his New York law license suspended in 2021 for making false statements around the election, is no longer allowed to practice law in the state, effective immediately. \"The seriousness of respondent's misconduct cannot be overstated,\" the decision read. The man once dubbed \"America's mayor\" \"flagrantly misused\" his position and \"baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country's electoral process\". \"In so doing, [the] respondent not only deliberately violated some of the most fundamental tenets of the legal profession, but he also actively contributed to the national strife that has followed the 2020 Presidential election, for which he is entirely unrepentant,\" the court wrote. Photos of Giuliani with what appeared to be hair dye running down his face went viral in 2020. (News Video) Mr Guiliani, 80, said on Tuesday that he was not surprised to lose his law license in his home town, claiming in a post on the social media platform X that the case was \"based on an activist complaint, replete with false arguments\". The former mob prosecutor was admitted to the New York bar in 1969 but before pleading Trump's case in November 2020, Mr Giuliani had not appeared in court as an attorney since 1992, according to court records. A spokesperson for Mr Giuliani, Ted Goodman, said the former mayor would appeal the \"objectively flawed\" decision by the mid-level state court. He also called on others in the legal community to speak out against the \"politically and ideologically corrupted decision\". Donald Trump's former personal lawyer files for bankruptcy just days after being ordered to pay $217 million to two former Georgia election workers he falsely accused of fraud following the former US president's 2020 election loss. Mr Giuliani's attorney, Arthur Aidala was more measured, saying his legal team was \"obviously disappointed\" but not surprised by the decision. Mr Aidala said they \"put up a valiant effort\" to prevent the disbarment but \"saw the writing on the wall.\" Mr Giuliani argued in hearings held last October that he believed the claims he was making on behalf of the Trump campaign were true, but the court, in its decision, said it was not convinced. \"Contrary to respondent's allegations, there is nothing on the record before us that would permit the conclusion that respondent lacked knowledge of the falsehood of the numerous statements that he made, and that he had a good faith basis to believe them to be true,\" the decision read. Among other things, the court said it found that Mr Giuliani \"falsely and dishonestly\" claimed during the 2020 presidential election that thousands of votes were cast in the names of dead people in Philadelphia, including a ballot in the name of the late boxing great Joe Frazier. He also falsely claimed people were taken from nearby Camden, New Jersey, to vote illegally in Pennsylvania city, the court said. \"These false statements were made to improperly bolster respondent's narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client,\" the decision read. In May, WABC radio suspended him and cancelled his daily talk show because he refused to stop making false claims about the 2020 election. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington. A board in May recommended that he be disbarred, though a court has the final say. He filed for bankruptcy last year after being ordered to pay $US148 million ($222 million) in damages to two former Georgia election workers over lies he spread about them that up-ended their lives with racist threats and harassment. An Arizona grand jury indicts the former president's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their efforts to use so-called fake electors to try to overturn Mr Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 US presidential election. Mr Giuliani on Monday asked a federal judge to convert his bankruptcy case from a reorganisation to a liquidation, which would mean most of his assets would be sold off to help pay what he owes creditors. At the end of May, he had about $US94,000 in cash on hand while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $US237,000 in the bank, according to court documents. Mr Giuliani is also facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. He's charged in Georgia with making false statements and soliciting false testimony, conspiring to create phoney paperwork and asking state politicians to violate their oath of office to appoint an alternate slate of pro-Trump electors. The Arizona indictment accuses Mr Giuliani of pressuring Maricopa County officials and state legislators to change the outcome of Arizona's results and encouraging Republican electors in the state to vote for Trump in December 2020. Mr Giuliani built his public persona by practicing law as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan in the 1980s, when he went after mobsters, powerbrokers and others. The law-and-order reputation helped catapult him into politics, governing the United States' most populous city when it was beset by high crime. The Republican was lauded for holding the city together after the September 11 terror attacks, when two hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,700 people. But after unsuccessful runs for the US Senate and the presidency, and a lucrative career as a globetrotting consultant, Mr Giuliani smashed his image as a centrist who could get along with Democrats as he became one of Trump's most loyal defenders. He was the primary mouthpiece for Trump's false claims of election fraud after the 2020 vote, infamously standing at a press conference in front of Four Seasons Total Landscaping outside Philadelphia saying the campaign would challenge what he claimed was a vast conspiracy by Joe Biden and fellow Democrats. Lies around the election results helped push an angry mob of pro-Trump rioters to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an effort to stop the certification of Mr Biden's victory.

The president dialled into a call with worried members of his campaign team and told them he wasn't going anywhere, according to two sources familiar with the call. This past week was arguably the worst of Joe Biden's 2024 campaign. And it might have been one of Donald Trump's best. \"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running … no one's pushing me out,\" Mr Biden reportedly said on the call.  \"I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win.\" The president met with 24 Democratic governors and the mayor of Washington, DC, on Wednesday evening, local time, to reassure them he is up to the job. The Democratic governors of New York, Minnesota and Maryland expressed confidence in him and said they had an honest discussion after Mr Biden's debate performance. \"We were honest about the feedback that we were getting,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting at the White House.  \"The president is our nominee,\" he said. \"The president is our party leader.\" He added that, in the meeting, Mr Biden \"was very clear that he's in this to win.\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she felt confident after the meeting. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said Mr Biden's debate performance against Republican former president Donald Trump was bad but added that he felt Mr Biden was fit for office. Nearly a dozen of the state leaders attended the meeting in person, but only three spoke with reporters afterwards. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who participated in person, posted his reaction on social platform X: \"I heard three words from the President tonight — he's all in. And so am I.\" Mr Biden's campaign said the president reiterated his determination \"to defeat the existential threat of Donald Trump at the ballot box in November\" and discussed the importance of electing Democrats up and down the ballot. Kathy Hochul, Wes Moore and Tim Walz after the White House meeting.  (AP Photo: Jacquelyn Martin) \"All participants reiterated their shared commitment to do everything possible to make sure President Biden and Vice President Harris beat Donald Trump in November,\" it said.  Asked on Wednesday if Mr Biden was considering stepping down, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \"Absolutely not.\" Despite such reassuring sentiments, a major Democratic donor, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, also called on the president to exit the race.   He said: \"Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous.\" The statement was first reported by The New York Times. Mr Biden spoke to Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, on Tuesday, and senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader in the Senate, on Wednesday, a White House official said. It was supposed to ease concerns about his mental and physical fitness, but instead Joe Biden's debate performance only enhanced them. Now, the pressure on the president to pull out of the election race is intensifying. He also spoke with House Democrat Jim Clyburn on Wednesday, whose office said afterwards they had a long, private conversation. Mr Clyburn — a kingmaker of sorts within the Democratic Party and who was instrumental in Mr Biden's 2020 win — told CNN on Wednesday that the party should hold a \"mini-primary\" if Mr Biden steps aside, the first senior party member to talk publicly about how, exactly, replacing Mr Biden as a candidate would work. Mr Clyburn, who said on Tuesday that he would back Ms Harris as the presidential candidate if Mr Biden were to depart, added: \"If she were to be the nominee, we need to have a running mate and a strong running mate. \"And so all of this would give us an opportunity, not just to measure up who would be good to be at the top of the ticket, but also who would be best in second place.\" Mr Biden's halting, shaky debate performance against Trump in Atlanta last week sparked calls for him to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate for the November 5 election.  Trump repeated a well-worn slate of falsehoods, including that he won the 2020 election. Democrats raised fresh concerns about Mr Biden on Tuesday, with one house member calling for him to drop out and former speaker Nancy Pelosi, a long-time ally, saying it was legitimate to ask whether Mr Biden's performance in Atlanta was an \"episode\" or a condition. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. The president has said he was tired after two foreign trips and the White House has said he had a cold. His campaign has held damage control calls with donors, and Mr Biden has shown no signs so far of abandoning his quest for a second term. White House chief of staff Jeff Zients held a call with demoralised White House staff on Wednesday as well, acknowledging that it had been a challenging few days while stressing that the Biden team had a record to be proud of and more work to do. A handful of governors are potential rivals to Mr Biden if pressure for him to step aside were to increase, but many of them also speak on his behalf on the campaign trail. Ms Harris is the likely successor if Mr Biden does step aside, multiple sources told Reuters. However, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear have all been mentioned as possible replacements to Mr Biden if he decides to bow out as the 2024 candidate.

(ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Christine Cloud never thought her life would end up like this.   At age 63, she's been forced to move back home to live with her 83-year-old widower father. \"I can't afford to pay rent on my own, and he can't afford to make his house payment on his own,\" she says.  The retired doctor's office manager had to make the move after the monthly rent on her Las Vegas two-bedroom apartment was hiked from $US1,200 to $US1,500 ($1,800-$2,200). And it's not just housing costs that have skyrocketed.  \"Everything's up,\" she says. \"Gas prices are crazy, food's gone way up. Eggs, bread, milk, meat, the basics just went through the roof.\"  Christine Cloud moved back in with her father after she was hit with a 25 per cent rent hike. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Christine, who used to be a registered Democrat, is quick to ascribe blame to that party.  So, despite some apprehensions, she's planning to vote for former Republican president Donald Trump in November. \"It's, like, lesser of two evils,\" she says.  \"Since 2020 things have like taken a dive. It's not working. It was not like that when Trump was president. \"[Trump's] a little scary. He is. But I think that's why he was effective, because people are a little afraid of him.\"  Christine Cloud sees this election as a choice between two evils. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) The sun-drenched state of Nevada's been suffering from some of the highest inflation in the nation. Housing is a particular pain point. By one estimate, rents in the Las Vegas area are 30 per cent higher than they were in January 2020. It's also difficult if you're trying to buy.  The median home listing price in Vegas has increased from around $US343,000 in January 2021 to about $US460,000, even as interest rates have climbed dramatically. Christine switched her allegiance away from the Democrats in 2020. She was motivated in part by the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the nation, some of which were marred by violence and property damage. She was angered to see some members of the party supporting them. \"I just thought, the Democrats are crazy,\" she says. \"I've been in this group that's crazy all this time.\" Border security, which she thinks the Republicans are much stronger on, is also a major issue for her in the upcoming election. But it's inflation that's the main driver of her vote.  Many of Nevada's jobs are dependent on tourism, and they don't always pay well. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Christine is an example of the problem President Joe Biden's campaign is facing in Nevada.  The state has voted for the Democratic candidate at the past four presidential elections.   Biden won the state by more than 2 per cent over Trump in 2020. But most recent polling shows Trump has opened a lead in the state. One recent poll found the economy was the key issue for nearly a third of voters, and for 45 per cent of Trump supporters. There are countervailing economic narratives at play in the US. The Biden administration points to high economic growth and low unemployment as proof of the success of his economic policies, including his aggressive moves to support industrial production in the US. Christine says she's not swayed by this argument.  \"I know that they say that about unemployment and all that. But people in their day-to-day lives, they feel it in their pockets.\" Biden's term has been bedevilled by high inflation. It's come well down from the 9.1 per cent recorded in June 2022, but it's still running at above 3 per cent, which is higher than the Federal Reserve's 2 per cent target. What caused inflation to spike is highly contested. A huge amount of stimulus was pumped into the economy by both the Trump and Biden administrations as they tried to insulate the economy during the COVID pandemic. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the trade sanctions that followed also caused prices to spike around the world. But fairly or not, many voters lay the blame at Biden's door and it's the compounding of those price increases that is particularly difficult for his administration to overcome. On average, prices are now up about 20 per cent since Biden took office. In recent times, wage increases have outstripped price rises, leaving workers better off on average. But \"Bidenomics\" does not seem to be working for Biden politically with people like Christine. Nevada is known globally for its liberal gambling laws and the bright lights and shows of the Vegas strip. The state has ridden both boom and bust over time. Huge wealth was generated through the discovery of gold and silver, but it's the tourism industry that's now the backbone of the economy. It was badly hurt during COVID, but it's mostly bounced back. When the ABC visited in June, the state was sweltering in an extraordinary, record-breaking heatwave. In a garage gym, with air-conditioning and multiple fans running at full capacity, personal trainer Will McMichael was putting his client Eliza Turner through her paces.   Will McMichael is one of Nevada's many California transplants. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Dressed in a \"Veterans for Biden\" tank top, he leaves no doubt as to who he'll be voting for at November's election. But his words of support aren't as enthusiastic an endorsement as you might expect. \"I'm not a Biden stan,\" he says. \"I think that he is competent, which makes him 1,000 times better than the felon.\" Will, 41, moved to Nevada six years ago, one of the many Californians who've shifted to the neighbouring state in recent years. The former soldier originally moved to the state as a firearms instructor. When the ABC asked him what he saw as the biggest issue at the election, he answered, \"For voters in Nevada, always, economy, economy, of course.\" But for him personally, it's about the very future of the US — what some pollsters have come to calling \"saving democracy\" when trying to gauge sentiment. \"The major issue for me in this election is stemming the tide of autocracy,\" Will says.  \"I think that Trump has pretty much told us he is an autocrat.\"  Trump's failure to accept his loss at the 2020 presidential election, and his continued support for those involved in the January 6 riot on the US Capitol, remain a concern for his detractors. He's still facing a federal trial over his role on the historic day, although it's unlikely to occur before the election.   And while he has been found guilty of falsifying business records during the 2016 election campaign, his sentencing has been postponed as his lawyers argue a recent Supreme Court ruling means his conviction should be overturned. Eliza says she doesn't understand how Trump's still one of the major candidates for commander-in-chief.  \"It's just unbelievable to me that we have a literal convicted felon as a frontrunner to the Republican Party and very likely has a chance at becoming the president again,\" she says. For Eliza Turner, LGBTQ rights and the cost of living are key election issues. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) But that doesn't mean she's a lock to vote for Biden.  As a transgender woman, she says the top issue for her would \"kind of be the obvious thing — LGBTQ rights, specifically transgender rights, which are obviously a very hot-button topic this year\".  But coming in a close second is the cost of living.  \"The economy in general is at a pretty bad state right now,\" she says. \"I started off four years ago doing pretty well financially, in a relatively decent job and doing pretty well in living here.  \"But each year, it's just becoming harder and harder just to get by. And at this point in time, I'm more or less living just month to month.\"  Eliza's considering supporting a third-party candidate, but says she's weighing the potential impact of her vote carefully.  \"Maybe I shouldn't do a protest vote this time,\" she says.  \"Maybe I should just swallow my pride and just vote for Biden again to do my part to keep things from getting exponentially worse.\" Democrats have traditionally counted on strong support from the Latino community. In Nevada, where almost 30 per cent of people identify as Hispanic or Latino, it's crucial. David Damore, a political scientist at the University of Nevada, says about 60 per cent of the state's Latino population is Democratic. Another 20 per cent is Republican, and the remaining 20 per cent is non-partisan, he says. But conservatives are making concerted efforts to woo the so-called \"Latino vote\". Among them are the LIBRE Initiative, a group that advocates for free-market policies in Hispanic communities. Eddie Diaz, the group's strategic director in Nevada, says he's constantly hearing complaints from Latinos about rising living costs. \"Inflation has hurt people a lot,\" he says. \"And right now they see that that's coming from the Democrat party, right? That they're not delivering on their promises to solve this whole economic crisis.\" Eddie Diaz talks politics in Spanish on a local radio station, where the LIBRE Initiative has bought airtime. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Many Republicans have long believed that eventually Latinos would cross the political aisle. Then-president Ronald Reagan declared back in 1983, \"Latinos are Republicans – they just don't know it yet\". Eddie subscribes to that thinking. \"I feel, as Hispanics and Latinos, we're more of a conservative base,\" he says.  \"We believe in family, we believe in God and we believe in hard work. But the messaging was not out there.\" Others in the community see things differently.  The Voto Latino organisation, which claims to have registered more than 1 million Latino voters since 2012, is endorsing Biden. It points to Trump's policies \"that separated parents from their children at the border and put children in cages\", and says he poses an \"unprecedented threat\" to Latinos. In contrast, the group praises Biden's expansion of healthcare coverage and price cuts for prescription drugs. On the southern border of the US, the Texas governor has taken drastic steps to keep migrants out of the country, and to reshape the political debate inside it. The Republicans are also contending with disunity within the right-wing cohort. The LIBRE Initiative isn't actively pushing people to vote for Trump. It's affiliated with right-wing donor Charles Koch, who backed Nikki Haley's bid in her bitter Republican primary contest against the former president.  So instead, LIBRE is focused on getting people to vote Republican in some of the other races, like Senate seats, which will be decided on the same day as the presidential election. On a personal level, Eddie says he's disappointed it's once again a choice between Biden and Trump. \"As much as I like Trump's policies, he's still a divisive person,\" he says. \"I don't know if he's going to be the one that's going to be able to unite the country.\" He may not be able to unite the country but if Trump is able to win Nevada in November, it's likely he'll be on his way back to the White House. — with Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Analysis by Peter Martin Cost of Living Inflation US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Four members of the Democratic Party voiced concern about Mr Biden's future as party leader on a leadership call, following his performance in the presidential debate, which was widely panned. The 81-year-old is doubling down on campaigns in swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan that will prove crucial in an increasingly tight race against Republican Donald Trump. An embattled United States President Joe Biden is facing escalating pressure to withdraw from the presidential race, with about a dozen fellow Democrats now calling on him to step aside. During a leadership call with several Democratic Party members on Sunday, four more of Mr Biden's colleagues expressed concern about his candidacy, urging him to let another nominee stand in his place, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. According to reports from US media outlets NBC News and The Washington Post, Representatives Jerrold Nadler, Adam Smith, Mark Takano and Joseph Morelle were among those who called on Mr Biden to drop his re-election bid. The senior House Democrats sit on the Judiciary, Armed Services, Veterans Affairs and House Administration committees respectively. As the race to become president of the United States continues to heat up, members of the Democratic party fear for their leader, Joe Biden. They also suggested Vice-President Kamala Harris, seen as the likeliest candidate to replace Mr Biden in the November 5 election were he to bow out, could perform well. Representatives Richie Neal, Rosa DeLauro, Maxine Waters, and Robert C \"Bobby\" Scott are said to have defended the president in the two-hour discussion, the Washington Post reported. Mr Biden has faced mounting calls to end his re-election bid after a halting performance against Republican Donald Trump in the June 27 presidential debate. The president's occasionally incoherent performance re-ignited fresh criticism about his age and raised questions about his ability to do the job for another four years. But he has vowed to stay in the race, dismissing calls for him to drop out as \"nonsense\" in a fundraising email on Saturday. Asked in Harrisburg whether the Democratic Party was behind him, Mr Biden told reporters \"yes\". Joe Biden's performance against Donald Trump in the US presidential debate has opened up deep party cracks on his re-election candidacy. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) Democratic senator Chris Murphy told CNN's State of the Union the coming week was crucial for the president to convince voters he is \"the old Joe Biden\". \"The president needs to do more,\" Murphy said. \"I do think the clock is ticking.\" Prior to Sunday's leadership call, five politicians publicly called for Mr Biden to step down, including Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives from a battleground district, with others said to be poised to join in. Two letters are circulating among House Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said. Meanwhile Mr Biden on Sunday worked to shore up support with campaign stops in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The 81-year-old received a rousing welcome at a black church in Philadelphia and later travelled to the state capital of Harrisburg for an event with union members. Black voters are a critical part of his support base but recent public opinion polling has shown their support for him softening. The church bishop, referring to Mr Biden's Republican challenger without naming him, chided those who \"make an issue of the president — that he is conditioned with stammering and not being able at certain times to bring forth words — while another person lies fluidly and you never challenge his lies.\" In a Friday interview with ABC News, Mr Biden said only the \"Lord Almighty\" could persuade him to drop out, dismissing the prospect that Democratic leaders could join forces to try to talk him into standing down. A Democratic National Committee (DNC) member from Florida, Alan Clendenin, joined calls urging Biden to step aside on Sunday. \"Joe Biden will be remembered by historians as one of the finest presidents in American history, but this election is about the next four years, not the last three and a half,\" Mr Clendenin said. The DNC has steadfastly supported Mr Biden since his debate stumbles so any defections could suggest a deepening of the crisis. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. Pennsylvania is one of the half dozen or so states alongside Wisconsin and Michigan that can swing Democratic or Republican and is expected to play a central role in determining the outcome of what has been a tight race. Sunday's trip — Mr Biden's 10th to Pennsylvania during the 2024 election campaign — is part of a July voter outreach blitz by the Democratic Party that includes a $50 million media campaign aimed at events such as the Olympics, and travel by the president, the first lady, Ms Harris and her husband to multiple battleground states. Mr Biden will visit swing state Nevada on July 16 and 17, the White House said on Sunday, where he will deliver remarks at the NAACP National Convention and UnidosUS Annual addressing black and Latino audiences. He will also travel to Austin, Texas on July 15, where he will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the LBJ Presidential Library. Pressure from Congress is expected to ramp up in the coming days as politicians return to Washington from a holiday recess and donors mull their willingness to keep funding his campaign. Mr Biden is also preparing to host dozens of world leaders at a NATO summit in Washington this week and hold a rare solo news conference.

In the days since his disastrous televised debate performance, he's been under pressure from within and outside his own party to step aside for a younger candidate. He's responded to the ongoing speculation by writing to his colleagues in Congress and phoning into a TV show to insist he's not going anywhere. Here are some of the key developments from another eventful day in Washington. Biden tweeted out a letter that he has sent to Democrats in Congress. It said he was \"not blind\" to the \"good faith fears and worries\" held by voters and members of his party. But, he wrote, he was \"firmly committed to staying in this race\". He argued he had a \"deep obligation\" to the Democratic Party voters who had chosen him as their candidate. \"It was their decision to make. Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned. The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party?\" Biden said the \"question of how to move forward\" had been \"well-aired for over a week\", but it was time for it to end. \"We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us.\" Shortly after the letter was released publicly, Biden called into one of his favourite TV shows — MSNBC's Morning Joe — for an apparently impromptu interview.  He said he was getting \"so frustrated by the elites\" in his party. \"I don't care what the millionaires think,\" he said. And he dared any Democratic challengers to take him on at the party's convention in Chicago in late August. “Any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention.” He laughed when host Mika Brzezinski, a vocal Biden supporter, asked if he had been tested for any conditions that might explain a debate night \"where you couldn't finish sentences\". \"If there was something that was wrong that night, it's not like it comes and that's one night and it goes away. That's why I've been out, I've been testing myself, I've been tested everywhere I go, going out and making the case. The night of that debate, I went out. I was out til 2 o'clock in the morning that very night, that very night. It drives me nuts, people talking about this.\" While there's been a growing number of people inside his party pushing for him to stand aside, others are going in to bat for him. Nevada congressman Steven Horsford, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, pledged his ongoing support on social media. Biden held a virtual meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus on Monday evening, local time. Meanwhile, one of the state governors touted as a possible replacement for Biden, Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, ruled herself out.  Asked by AP if she would consider becoming a candidate this year if Biden stepped down, she said no. As Joe Biden faces increasing calls to step aside from the presidential race, here are the Democrat voices speaking out against him so far. \"It's a distraction more than anything,\" Whitmer said. \"I don't like seeing my name in articles like that because I'm totally focused on governing and campaigning for the ticket.\" And possibly Biden's biggest supporter, first lady Jill Biden, was back out on the campaign trail telling voters she was \"all in\".  \"For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he’s all in,\" she told a crowd in North Carolina. \"That’s the decision that he's made. \"And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in too.\"  (Jill Biden teaches English and writing at a community college.) Donald Trump has questioned Biden's mental acuity for years, but he largely stayed out of the conversation about his age since the debate. Following Biden's MSNBC interview, though, Trump also phoned into one his preferred TV shows and did an interview of his own. On Fox News' Hannity program, Trump took the opportunity to say Biden looked weak and pale onstage during the debate. \"It was a strange evening, I will tell you. It was a strange debate, because within a couple of minutes, the answers given by him, they didn't make a lot of sense.\"  He predicted Biden would stay in the race.  \"He's got an ego and he doesn't want to quit,\" Trump said. The speculation about Biden's candidacy is crashing into a big week with world leaders in Washington. Christine Cloud never thought she'd be forced to move in with her father in retirement, but the rising cost of living is biting in Nevada. Now, she's an example of Joe Biden's big problem in the crucial swing state. NATO leaders are meeting in the US capital from Tuesday, local time, for a summit marking the 75th anniversary of the alliance. Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles will attend parts of the summit. Although Australia is not a NATO member, it has a formal partnership with NATO. Biden will have his first face-to-face talks with Britain's new prime minister, Keir Starmer, at the White House on Wednesday. He will then host an event with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday. He's also scheduled to give a rare press conference that day. The White House said it was not hearing any concerns about Biden from allies headed for Washington. National security spokesman John Kirby said: \"We’re not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all, quite the contrary. The conversations we’re having with them in advance is they’re excited about this summit, they’re excited about the possibilities and the things we’ll be doing together, specifically to help Ukraine.\" During his MSNBC interview, Biden said: \"The rest of the world's looking, our allies are looking for US leadership.

(Reuters: Yara Nardi) In a year where almost half the world is heading to polls, it's unsurprising we've seen multiple international elections in just a few days. It can be hard to keep up with the surprise swings, new leaders, resignations, and campaign speculation. So we've rounded up the latest election news from around the grounds in one handy spot. Tap the links below to jump to each section. French politicians from a left-wing coalition are working out their next steps with President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance, after election results gave them the bulk of seats in a hung parliament. Mr Macron's centrist group did better than the polls had predicted in Sunday's parliamentary election. France's government and new left-wing coalition found a way to stop the far-right National Rally party getting power. But forging a path through the country's political deadlock is a much-bigger challenge.  But it was the left-wing Popular Front coalition that came first, and is now promising to select its own prime minister within a week. That could be a struggle – the left doesn't have enough MPs in parliament to form a majority, and may need to reach out to the centre. Meanwhile, the far-right has lost its momentum for now, as France enters a new period of political deal-making. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal submitted his resignation, but has been asked to stay in power in a caretaker capacity to \"ensure the country's stability\" and to see out the Paris Olympics, which kick off later this month.

(AP: Vahid Salemi) Former heart surgeon Masoud Pezeshkian has won Iran's runoff presidential election, besting hardliner Saeed Jalili. Iran has elected its first reformist president in two decades. Can he deliver change? A vote count offered by authorities put Mr Pezeshkian as the winner, with 16.3 million votes to Mr Jalili's 13.5 million in Friday's election. Mr Pezeshkian's win sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high over the Israel-Hamas war, Iran's advancing nuclear program, and a looming US election that could put any chance of a détente between Tehran and Washington at risk. The Kremlin congratulated Mr Pezeshkian on his victory, and said Russia hoped its partnership with Tehran would continue. Meanwhile, White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States was not ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran under the new president.

(Reuters: Claudia Greco) When Britons overwhelmingly voted for Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party in a landslide win that ended 14 years of Conservative government, they elected the most diverse parliament in history. The newly-installed parliament includes a record 242 female MPs, 22 more than after the last election in 2019. The Tories have been punished by voters at the ballot box for a series of scandals. Experts say the party's next steps aren't clear. Black, Asian and ethnic minority MPs now represent about 13 per cent of the House of Commons, up from 10 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, British opposition leader Rishi Sunak has appointed his shadow cabinet following a historic election defeat where a record number of cabinet ministers lost their seats. Most notable, former prime minister David Cameron has resigned from his role as Foreign Secretary. This week, Sir Keir will visit the White House to have his first face-to-face meeting with US President Joe Biden after being congratulated over the phone following his victory. And speaking of the US president… Several senior Democrats have called for US President Joe Biden to step aside. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Mr Biden says it's time for questions about his candidacy for the US presidential election to end after some House Democrats urged the 81-year-old to step aside. Writing to congressional Democrats, Mr Biden says his party had one job — which is to defeat Donald Trump — and any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity only helps the Republican leader. At the same time, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has rejected speculation Mr Biden is being treated for Parkinson's disease, saying if he were ill it would have been picked up on routine medical examinations. Adam Smith is the latest Democrat to ask Mr Biden to end his re-election bid, telling CNN Vice-President Kamala Harris would be a better choice ahead of the November election. \"Well look, I think he should step aside,\" Mr Smith said. \"I think it's become clear that he's not the best person to carry the Democratic message, and here's the thing: we have an incredibly strong message and record to run on, and all respect to the president, he's done a great job. \"Personally, I think Kamala Harris would be a much better, stronger candidate.\" ABC/wires Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Analysis by Kathryn Diss Topic:Elections Analysis by Nassim Khadem Analysis by Riley Stuart Elections France Iran, Islamic Republic Of Political Parties and Movements US Elections United Kingdom United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Evan Vucci) There has been a wave of new pressure on US President Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic candidate. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and celebrity George Clooney are among those casting doubts on his ability to win against Donald Trump in November. Analysts say concerns are likely to grow and it's only a matter of time before he decides to go. Political pressure is continuing to mount on US President Joe Biden to step aside over fears he will lose to Donald Trump in the November presidential election. The slow drip of criticism from within the Democratic Party turned into a sudden flurry of grave pronouncements on Wednesday (local time). Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Biden must decide quickly whether to stay in the 2024 White House race. Hollywood star George Clooney, a Democrat who co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Mr Biden last month, withdrew his support with a damning opinion piece in the New York Times saying the 81-year-old was not the same man he was in 2020. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has privately signalled to donors he's open to a Democratic candidate other than Mr Biden, Axios reported. And Senator Peter Welch became first Democratic senator to explicitly call for the president to step aside, writing in an op-ed that he needs to withdraw \"for the good of the country\". Analysts say the momentum of criticism is unlikely to slow down and \"the clock is ticking\".  So will Biden keep digging his heels in or is he likely to go? Since his halting debate performance against 78-year-old Trump nearly two weeks ago, Mr Biden has sought to stem defections by Democratic politicians, donors and other allies. As the race to become president of the United States continues to heat up, members of the Democratic party fear for their leader, Joe Biden. The president has repeatedly insisted he is the best person to beat Trump, and has said he just had a bad night at the debate. Senior Democratic Congressman Joe Courtney told ABC News Breakfast there's been \"very spirited discussions\" within the party this week about Mr Biden's ability to lead the country over the next four years.  He said Mr Biden's address to NATO leaders in Washington this week was reassuring, but in terms of the debate: \"You can’t unsee that\".  \"I think he did well yesterday with the NATO speech, and he has to keep that up,\" he said. \"I think that's what a lot of his supporters and admirers, like myself, are looking for … We really don't want to look back after November and think that history is going to judge us poorly with how this all unfolds.\" Ms Pelosi, who is a close friend of the president, declined to say definitively that she wanted Biden to run. But her remarks, which ignored Mr Biden's repeated insistence that he is staying in the race, suggested he could face a fresh wave of calls from fellow Democrats to exit the race.  \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said in an interview with MSNBC.  \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\" Bill Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, said Ms Pelosi's comments were sending a message. \"Nobody can accuse Nancy Pelosi as being naive, she knew exactly what she was doing,\" he told ABC's RN Breakfast.  Dr Emma Shortis, senior researcher in international and security affairs at The Australia Institute, agreed that Ms Pelosi's comments were \"carefully calibrated\". \"Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are really senior figures in the Democratic Party, which suggests to me that Biden is in a fair bit of trouble and he hasn't recovered in the way that he needs to,\" Dr Shortis said. \"Like anything in politics, once that momentum starts the story begins feeding on itself, it's very difficult to break that.\" Joe Biden has been under pressure to deliver remarks without the help of a teleprompter following the presidential debate. (Reuters: Yves Herman) In his opinion piece, Clooney wrote: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010.  Just a few weeks after helping the president raise tens of millions at an LA fundraiser, George Clooney is calling on Joe Biden to step aside. It's deeply damaging on several fronts. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Reporters asked Mr Biden at a NATO summit about Clooney's op-ed, and he pivoted to a show of support by union leaders. And when queried about whether he had Ms Pelosi's support, he responded by raising a triumphant fist. Meanwhile, when his campaign was asked about Clooney, and remarks made by Ms Pelosi, they pointed to a letter he sent Democrats in Congress saying he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and beating Trump. \"The White House has done everything it can do to stop it [the criticism] and Mr Biden himself intervened forcefully early in the week to indicate that he wasn't going anywhere, and that it was time for the conversation to end,\" Mr Galston said.   \"But clearly, especially elected Democrats are very, very worried about the outcome of the Fall elections and are not taking their cues from the president.\" Dr Shortis said at the moment it looks like Mr Biden is committed to staying in the race, but the pressure could get too much. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. \"All of those public statements are very clear, but his position may very quickly become untenable,\" she said. \"I think he will keep digging his heels in until he doesn't.\" She said part of the reason he has been holding on for so long is due to a lack of succession planning. \"There was a whole field of young, diverse, vibrant candidates in the Democratic Party, and neither Biden nor the party have done anything to build them up, to support them, or build their profiles,\" she said \"It is a catastrophic failure.\" Vice-President Kamala Harris is pitted as the party frontrunner to replace Mr Biden if he were to step aside. \"I think part of the reason he hasn't stepped aside is because, for whatever reason, he feels that Harris can't, or shouldn't do it,\" Dr Shortis said.  Ultimately Mr Biden has the final say as to whether he stays or goes. And he will need to make that decision soon. \"The clock is ticking,\" Mr Galston said.  \"Congress is going on another break at the end of the week and I cannot imagine that this situation can go on much longer than that.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Jade Macmillan Topic:World Politics Topic:Explainer Elections Foreign Affairs US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

The president said: \"If I slow down, I can't get the job done.\" Look back on our blog to see how it all unfolded. By Caitlin Rawling It is nearly 1am in Washington DC so we will end our live coverage here. Here are some of the key moments from Joe Biden's presser: You can look back at all of the developments below, or  download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Esther Linder North America correspondent Barbara Miller has looked at where Joe Biden left critics and supporters alike after his performance at the US president's first major press conference in eight months, where he answered questions from reporters unscripted. Saying he had unfinished business, that the \"gravity of the situation\" meant he had to seek a second term, and mixing up the names of his vice president Kamala Harris and presidential opponent Donald Trump, Biden gave a \"meandering but passable\" performance. Read the full analysis here: By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan With the intense speculation over Joe Biden's future consuming so much attention, there hasn't been quite as much paid to who Donald Trump is going to announce as his running mate. What had been a long list of options is widely reported to have been narrowed down to three: Florida senator Marco Rubio, Ohio senator JD Vance, and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum. Each offers potential advantages and pitfalls. Rubio, for example, could help Trump gain support among Latino voters, but he might have to move out of Florida due to the US constitution preventing a presidential and vice-presidential candidate living in the same state. Vance has shifted from a \"never-Trump guy\" to - in the words of one US media outlet - a \"MAGA king\". But he might not help the former president with swing voters. And Trump is reportedly drawn to Burgum's reputation as a \"self made man\", but he doesn't have a lot of national name recognition. Trump keeps teasing the VP announcement, and it could come at a rally he has planned in Pennsylvania over the weekend. But he likes to keep everyone guessing, and there's still a chance it might not be revealed until next week's Republican convention instead. By Esther Linder Age and wisdom aside, the eternal meme-ability of Joe Biden's gaffes will live on.  Researcher and expert on US domestic politics at the United States Studies Centre, Victoria Cooper, has told News Radio that the US president won't be able to live down recent gaffes, as he defends his decision to continue his bid for re-election. Within the first few minutes of today's long-awaited press conference he mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as \"Vice President Trump\" and earlier, introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\". \"Moments like this aren't necessarily reflective of the cognitive abilities of the president for example, they're often just a gaffe, but they do become sort of social media memes,\" she said.  \"They become these snackable moments that people like to replay.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Donald Trump kept an uncharacteristically low profile in the immediate aftermath of the debate, preferring to watch on as Democrats started tearing themselves apart. But in recent days he's publicly mocked the man he calls \"Sleepy Joe\", and took to Truth Social to highlight Joe Biden's early press conference slip-up. Trump has also ramped up his attacks on vice-president Kamala Harris, who's considered one of - if not the - most likely person to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, if he steps aside. Biden's candidacy crisis has been a gift for the former president, and he might be hoping his successor stays in the race if Trump believes it gives him the best chance of winning. But he'll want the spotlight back on his own campaign when the Republican National Convention gets underway in Milwaukee next week. By Esther Linder NATO talks delayed the start of the US president's unscripted prime-time address, but it finally got underway later Thursday night local time. Brad Ryan in the Washington DC bureau has summed up Joe Biden's so-called \"big boy press conference\" in a few key moments: By Caitlin Rawling Professor Brendan O'Connor says the gaffes Biden made will overshadow his detailed answers on the questions asked about his policies. \"These verbal faults of his misspeaking, that is going to be what  a lot of the press coming out of this is, not some of his more detailed answers to some of the questions,\" he told News Channel. You can watch the full interview here: By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan One of those members of Congress we mentioned earlier who called for Joe Biden's withdrawal post-press conference was Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. He told CNN there's \"not a single number out there\" that suggests Joe Biden can win November's election, and he argues it's too risky to stick with the president in case he repeats his debate performance at a later date. \"This needs to be resolved, I don't know, in the next five to seven days, because we just went 10 days where the story was not Donald Trump promising totalitarianism, it was how is Joe Biden going to do in the 'big boy' press conference?\" he said. \"This is the moment, and in the next 96 hours perhaps is the moment to set aside the poetry, the loyalty and the love, and ask yourself a hard question, which is, 'are you sure he's going to win?'\"  By Caitlin Rawling Over a dozen high-ranking Democrats have asked President Biden to step down, both before and after his solo press conference, this morning. It comes amid growing speculation about the president's health. You can read more of which Democrats have asked Biden to step aside  in Brianna Morris-Grant's story here: By Esther Linder The constant question on everyone's lips is whether Joe Biden is too old to be contesting the US presidential race at the age of 81 (his 82nd birthday is a couple of weeks after the November 5 election). Dr Emma Shortis, a senior researcher at the Australia Institute and historian of US and global politics, spoke to ABC News Channel about today's press conference and what it means for the octogenarian in the Oval Office. \"Recovery for Joe Biden at this stage is almost impossible because he effectively needs to prove that he is not too old and he is too old. \"I don't think he has done the job that he needed to in reassuring particularly his colleagues in the Democratic Party,\" she added. Dr Shortis called the succession of the presidency, whether now or after the election, a \"strategic nightmare\" for the Democratic Party. She noted senior Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries comments about \"candid conversations\" within caucus left the door open for a new candidate, which could well be vice-president Kamala Harris. By Nelli Saarinen The discussion on Joe Biden's press conference and whether it did enough to assure those doubting him focuses too much on his gaffes, says Matt Bevan, host of the ABC Podcast America, If You're Listening. \"The more crucial thing is that he's just not communicating very well\",  Bevan said. \"He starts a point and then he gets distracted by something and goes off on another tangent, or he'll throw in little side comments that don't really make sense unless you're really leaning in and listening very hard to what he's saying and you know all the back story.\" By Nelli Saarinen Is this the final nail in Biden's attempts to stay in the race? This press conference was a disaster and has only raised more questions rather than allay fears he wasn't up to the job. Scott Good on him. He has done a fantastic job for the free world. The position is more that one person. Too much media hype … Shame on them, but what’s new Peter This is so hard to watch. I’m not sure how much longer I can look at this trainwreck. This election is too important to have this insecurity. Stephanie Joe is a lovely and gracious man, but I'm afraid it's time for him to pass the baton to a younger person. Too many gaffes for a world leader. Peter Enderby Seems to me the problem with presidential politics - so much focus on the individual, whether they're up for it, whether they are healthy, energetic, smart or crazy (not to name names). It takes the focus away from the actual policies and puts it on the person, good or bad. Josh By Esther Linder John Barron, host of ABC show Planet America, reckons this performance may have quelled murmurs in the Democratic Party of replacing Joe Biden with a younger, less gaffe-prone candidate. \"If the knives were going to come out into the open, we were going to see them,\" he told ABC News Channel following the end of Biden's solo press conference. \"We have heard ... that literally dozens of Democratic members of Congress are ready to break out into the open and call on Joe Biden to step down, but this performance may well have been good enough to halt that. He says the Biden campaign has been doing internal polling on the popularity of Kamala Harris, the most obvious replacement if Biden were to go. By North America correspondent Barbara Miller In a post on X, the Biden-Harris campaign has homed in on President Biden's Putin gaffe. While it might seem strange to  highlight it, the thinking is likely it's better to own it and try and focus attention on the interaction between the president and the Ukrainian leader in its immediate aftermath. By Caitlin Rawling  Since Biden addressed the media, three more leading Democrats have urged him to stand aside from the presidential race. Politico is reporting Congressman Scott Peters says Biden should withdraw.  Congressman Jim Himes also says he no longer believes Biden is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump. Representative Eric Sorensen has tweeted: \"I am hopeful Biden will step aside in his campaign for President.\" By Esther Linder ABC's North America correspondent Barbara Miller was in the room for Joe Biden's first solo press conference this year, and told ABC's News Channel that the gaffes will be remembered above all from today. \"This was a man digging in again, that was very clear,\" she said of the \"tense and controlled\" atmosphere in the room, where Biden had a list of specific reporters to call on and White House aides controlled the roving microphones. \"There is no real acknowledgement still of just how deep the concerns go about Joe Biden's presidency,\" she said. \"I didn't get the sense that this was a guy who was levelling with his audience. He was very confident, very proud of his achievements.\" By Esther Linder Bruce Wolpe, senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre and former Democrat staffer, spoke to News Channel just earlier about Joe Biden's work to shore up his future and possible second term as US president. \"I think the tide has been halted and will now roll back,\" Mr Wolpe said. \"If he has another gaffe, another problem, another freeze up later in July, August, September, that is when a cataclysmic event will happen, but for now I believe he is secure.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Joe Biden's two verbal stumbles today - mixing up Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and Ukraine's president with Russia's - will dominate headlines out of this press conference. But overall, this was a stronger performance than the president's dismal debate two weeks ago. Biden remained defiant, insisting he's best qualified to take on Donald Trump and that he's going to \"finish the job\" he started. He spruiked his record in office, attacked Donald Trump as a threat to domestic and global security and dismissed calls to take a cognitive test, arguing that no matter what he did, \"no-one's going to be satisfied\". Trump has already started mocking the president over the Harris/Trump gaffe, with the sarcastic comment, \"Great job, Joe!\" But what really matters now is whether Biden has done enough to settle anxious Democrats — or if the momentum that had been building around calls for his withdrawal had already gone too far. By Esther Linder Planet America host John Barron is speaking to ABC News Channel and characterised Joe Biden's performance as \"strong\" despite today's name-swapping gaffes. \"This is his strong suit, foreign policy, characterising Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as threats to NATO,\" he said. \"If this Joe Biden had turned up two weeks ago at that debate we would not be in the situation. \"This was a perfectly competent performance by somebody who for his many faults knows foreign policy inside out.\" By Caitlin Rawling The press conference has wrapped up but here are some pictures of Biden during it.

So it was a high-stakes gamble to do an unscripted prime-time media conference with a press pool that has been starved of access (his last one was eight months ago). Here are some of the stand-out moments. Biden's press conference was delayed because he was tied up with other commitments at the NATO summit he'd been attending. And he was still giving a brief speech at the summit when his press conference had been scheduled to start.  Look back on our live blog to see how events unfolded. America's cable news networks, which were waiting for the press conference, broadcast that speech live. It was also covered by all the national news bulletins, which aired soon afterwards. So an unusually large audience saw this awkward moment from the president before his press conference even began. Biden: Now I want to hand over to the President of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination. Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin... There's a pause and some polite applause, but Biden quickly realises his error. Biden: President Putin? He is going to beat President Putin! President Zelenskyy. I am so focused on beating Putin... Zelenskyy: I am better. Biden: You are a hell of a lot better. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Biden quickly realised his error, recovered tidily, and made a bit of a joke. But it's still the kind of slip-up that very much fits in the categories of \"things Biden supporters hoped he wouldn't say\" and \"things Biden haters will turn into viral content\". It's hard to know whether Biden's pre-presser error was a simple slip of the tongue or a sad sign of decline. But many will diagnose from afar. And on a day that was widely considered Biden's last shot at turning the tide, it was definitely not helpful. Biden began the press conference with some prepared remarks, which he read from a teleprompter. He criticised Putin as a \"murderous madman\" who was \"on the march\", and argued the case for a strong, well-supported NATO alliance. He also spoke to some new data showing inflation was down and prices had fallen. He pointed to a fall in undocumented migration at the southern border. And he spoke about efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. There were some verbal stumbles and words running into one another, but this isn't atypical for Biden, whose tendency to mutter and mumble has long been the subject of critique.  Overall, it was a spirited, confident speech under high pressure. But these weren't the off-the-cuff remarks everyone had been waiting to watch. Predictably, the first thing Biden was asked about was the growing list of people concerned about his candidacy.  \"My question for you is: how are you incorporating these developments into your decision to stay and, separately, what concerns do you have about Vice-President Harris's ability to beat Donald Trump if she were at the top of the ticket?\" Biden began his response by saying: \"Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice-President Trump to be vice-president [if] I think she was not qualified to be president.\" Unlike earlier, when he called Zelenskyy \"President Putin\", he didn't notice he'd mixed up some names this time. But Donald Trump did, and quickly had a dig on social media. The president's age, acuity and health were always going to dominate this press conference. He no doubt knew that. But he still seemed to bristle a little at some of those questions. He insisted he was the \"most qualified person to run for president\".  \"I beat [Trump] once and I will beat him again\", he said. He said past presidents had come back from worse polling numbers at this point in an election campaign and won. He pointed to an \"incredibly successful\" NATO conference as evidence his presidency was not damaging for America's standing. And when he was asked about reports that he'd privately acknowledged he needed to go to bed earlier than in the past, he insisted they were not true. \"What I said was, instead of my every day starting at 7 and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more.  \"And I said, for example … instead of starting a fundraiser at 9 o'clock, start it at 8 o'clock. People get to go home by 10 o'clock. That's what I am talking about.\" Since he \"made that stupid mistake in the debate\", he said, his schedule \"has been full bore\". \"And where's Trump been? Riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball? I mean, look, he has done virtually nothing. And I have done — I don't know how many, don't hold me to it — roughly 20 major events. Some of them with thousands of people showing up.\" He won't \"travel into 15 time zones a week before\" the next debate, Biden said, referencing the jet lag that was offered as an explanation for his poor performance at the first debate. (He'd travelled to Europe more than a week before the debate, but he had spent the week leading up to it at his Camp David retreat.) He then said: \"I love my staff, but they add things, add things all the time. I am catching hell from my wife.\" This explanation seemed to contradict what he had said previously about his staff and his travel schedule. According to several reports, he told a fundraiser after the debate: \"I decided to travel around the world a couple times, going through I don't know how many time zones — for real, I think it was 15 time zones... I didn't listen to my staff.\" Biden said he understood why some Democrats in Congress might be nervous about his candidacy, given his poor polling in some states. \"The truth of the matter is, I understand the self-interest. If they think that, you know, running with Biden is going to hurt them then they will run away. And I get it.\" But he suggested their fears were unfounded. \"How accurate does anybody think the polls are these days? I can give you a series of polls where you have, likely voters, me versus Trump, where I win all the time. And in some of them he wins all the time. When the unlikely voters vote, he wins sometimes. \"The bottom line is, all the polling data right now, which I think is premature, because the campaign really hasn't even started, hasn't started in earnest yet.  \"Most of the time, it doesn't start until after September, after Labour Day. So a lot can happen.\" Before the press conference, there were 14 Democrats in Congress publicly calling for Biden to step aside. (Here's a full list.) Three more joined the list shortly after the press conference concluded. The first was Connecticut congressman Jim Himes, who tweeted that Biden's \"legacy as a great president is secure\", but: \"He must not risk that legacy, those accomplishments and American democracy to soldier on in the face of the horrors promised by Donald Trump.\" California congressman Scott Peters followed up with a statement soon after, which said in part: \"The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course... We must find a candidate from our deep bench of talent who can defeat Donald Trump.\" Then, Illinois congressman Eric Sorensen tweeted: \"I am hopeful Biden will step aside in his campaign for president.\" Biden's candidacy remains under a cloud, but he's given every indication he'll keep fighting. His next opportunity will be at a rally in Detroit on Friday, local time, where he'll be joined by actor Octavia Spencer, according to Variety. He'll also do another one-on-one interview, this time with NBC's Lester Holt, due to air in the US on Monday.

His accounts were reinstated in 2023, but he faced tougher penalties if he broke the rules again. Now those restrictions will be rolled back.  The move comes five months out from the US federal election, with Mr Trump set to be formally named as the Republican party's nominee next week.  He was banned after his supporters rioted in Washington DC during a joint session of Congress formalising rival Joe Biden's election victory.  Here's how Meta described it: \"We indefinitely suspended then-US President Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts following his praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\" He was also banned from X, which was then called Twitter. In response, Mr Trump launched a social media platform he called Truth Social in February 2022. Donald Trump's Twitter account was suspended in January 2021. The ban meant all his tweets were removed.  His accounts have since been reinstated on X and on Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram.  Elon Musk allowed Mr Trump to return to X in November 2022, shortly after buying the platform. Meta reinstated him a few months later in March 2023.  But when it allowed him back on its platforms, Meta said it was doing so with \"new guardrails to deter repeat offences\". Typically, when someone is re-instated after an offence, repeat offences might see them barred from their accounts for somewhere between one and 30 days. But if Mr Trump broke the rules again, he would have copped harsher penalties.  Here's what Meta says on its policy page: \"When a public figure's restriction has expired and they regain access to Facebook or Instagram, they will be subject to heightened penalties to deter repeat offences.  \"While most new violations will trigger a one-month restriction from creating any content, more serious violations will merit a further two-year restriction.  \"As always, we may also disable any account that persistently posts violating content, despite repeated warnings and restrictions.\" Mr Trump has been active on Facebook and Instagram, however he has only posted on X once since being reinstated.  Meta says it has a responsibility to allow people to hear from the presidential nominees in the lead-up to the election.  Here's what Meta wrote in a blog post: \"With the party conventions taking place shortly, including the Republican convention next week, the candidates for President of the United States will soon be formally nominated.  \"In assessing our responsibility to allow political expression, we believe that the American people should be able to hear from the nominees for President on the same basis.  \"As a result, former President Trump, as the nominee of the Republican Party, will no longer be subject to the heightened suspension penalties.\" And, essentially, Meta he'd not broken these rules since being reinstated: \" … these penalties were a response to extreme and extraordinary circumstances, and have not had to be deployed.\" Because Mr Trump is about to be formally endorsed as the Republican party's nominee for the upcoming federal election. In Australia, the political parties choose their leaders internally, but the US process is much more of a public spectacle. Candidates within the same party compete with one another to be named as their party's pick.  And the parties typically don't formally endorse their nominees until a few months before the election.  In previous years there's been much more of a competition between potential candidates but, because Mr Trump has such a strong supporter base, it's been almost certain he'll be the Republican candidate.  The Republican Party will formally name Donald Trump as its presidential nominee next week.  (AP: Rebecca Blackwell) Americans will vote for their next president on Tuesday, November 5.  Donald Trump is 78 years old. That's three years younger than Democratic US President Joe Biden. Joe Biden is 81 years old.  He'll turn 82 a fortnight after the vote.  Joe Biden will recontest his presidency in the upcoming election.  (Reuters: Marco Bello) Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Social Media Topic:Government and Politics Topic:Social Media Topic:World Politics Social Media US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Joe Biden is attempting to restablise his shaky election campaign, addressing concerns about his age in a speech to supporters. Twenty Democratic members of Congress are now publicly calling on the president to exit the race for re-election, and donors have reportedly frozen $US90 million in funds. Mr Biden is campaigning in Detroit, in the swing state of Michigan. Democrats remain split over Joe Biden's candidacy for US president, with some piling on pressure to force him out of the election race as others push back and try to protect him. A day after closing the Washington NATO summit and gifting his opponents two highly shareable gaffes, the president campaigned in the battleground state of Michigan. He joked about his age with local supporters, and told them: \"I promise you I'm OK.\" \"I'm only 41,\" he quipped as he spoke to an assembled group in a Detroit restaurant. \"For the longest time I was too young,\" Mr Biden said, \"because I was the second-youngest man ever elected to the United States Senate. \"And now I'm too old. \"But hopefully, with a little bit of age comes a little bit of wisdom. And … in this moment, I think the alternative is not much of an alternative.\" Mr Biden later spoke at a campaign rally in Detroit, walking onto the stage to chants of, \"Don't you quit,\" from the crowd.  \"You've probably noticed there's been a lot of speculation lately,\" he said during an energetic and relatively stumble-free performance. \"I am running and we're going to win. I'm not going to change that.\" Oscar-winning actor Octavia Spencer greeted Joe Biden in Michigan and spoke at his campaign rally. (AP: Jacquelyn Martin) He also complained he had been taking a \"hammering\" for his errors while Mr Trump had been given a \"free pass\". \"People would rather talk about how I mix up names,\" he said. \"I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley 'Nancy Pelosi'.\"  The Biden camp has pointed to polling conducted since last month's debate, as it attempts to restabilise an election campaign knocked off course by intensifying doubts about Biden's fitness for office. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll has Mr Biden leading Mr Trump, 50 per cent to 48 per cent in a head-to-head match-up (2 per cent of respondents were undecided.) It is a slight improvement for Mr Biden on the previous month's poll, conducted before the debate, which found the men were tied on 49 per cent each. However, the change is within the margin of error (of 3.3 per cent) And when third-party candidates are introduced, Mr Trump edges ahead, 43-42. (Robert F Kennedy had 8 per cent, Cornel West 3 per cent, and Jill Stein 2 per cent.) \"Polling continues to show the same race we've been seeing, right? One that is close and unaffected by the debate,\" Biden campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said. He said campaign donations \"exploded\" during the president's post-NATO press conference on Thursday, local time. \"We hit seven times our average.\" But two more members of Congress joined the list of Democrats publicly pressing the 81-year-old president to move aside for a younger candidate. The calls from Colorado's Brittany Petterson and California's Mike Levin mean there are now 19 House Democrats and one senator publicly asking Mr Biden not to run. The US president took a high-stakes gamble on an unscripted prime-time media conference with a press pool that had been starved of access for months. Ms Petterson called on Mr Biden to \"pass the torch to one of our many capable Democratic leaders so we have the best chance to defeat [Republican candidate] Donald Trump\".  Mr Levin said he made the decision after hearing from hundreds of constituents in the fortnight since Mr Biden's debate against Mr Trump.  \"Making this statement is not easy,\" he said in a letter given to LA TV station KTLA. The New York Times is reporting that major donors have meanwhile frozen $US90 million ($132 million) in pledged donations while Mr Biden remains the candidate. Hakeem Jeffries, the most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, said he requested a meeting with Mr Biden, which was granted after his major media conference yesterday. \"I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward,\" Mr Jeffries wrote in a letter to colleagues after the meeting. He did not voice a personal view either way. But some senior Democrats have expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom, one of the Democrats often touted as a possible replacement for Mr Biden, said he had been responding to such suggestions with \"delete, delete, delete, delete\". In an interview excerpt published by CBS, Mr Newsom said he was \"all in, no daylight\" as a supporter of Mr Biden. And influential South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn told NBC he was \"ridin' with Biden\". Asked if he believed Mr Biden was \"still the same man\" as he was in 2020, Mr Clyburn said: \"Physically, I don't think so. Mentally, I do think so.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Barbara Miller Analysis by Jade Macmillan Topic:World Politics US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Former US president Donald Trump has been injured in a shooting at his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.  ABC News journalist Phoebe Hosier was in the crowd when shots rang out, just 12 minutes into Trump's speech. \"From my perspective, I ducked down straight away and I found the crowd's reaction to be mixed,\" Hosier said. \"Initially, only a few people just in front of us ducked down, along with myself and a few others around us, but there were others who didn't seem so perturbed about the gunshots we were hearing.\"  Hosier was about 50 metres from where Trump had been speaking on stage.   The former president was seen grabbing at his right ear before dropping to his knees, swarmed by Secret Service agents. \"A few men jumped up and started swearing,\" Hosier said.  \"We heard people saying 'f*** Obama, f*** the terrorists' amid numerous profanities we heard earlier in the rally.  \"So there was real anger.\"  After a few moments, Trump was escorted off stage to safety as blood trickled down his face.  Mr Trump was rushed off stage by Secret Service agents as blood trickled down his face.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) That's when chants of \"USA!

One of the dead is 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who the FBI said fired several shots in the former US president's direction from a rooftop on a property next to the rally. Mr Trump was also injured in the incident, and could be seen bleeding from the ear as he was rushed from the stage by the Secret Service, pausing to raise a fist in the air as his supporters chanted \"USA, USA!\". The FBI is investigating the shooting, and the Secret Service is facing questions from congressional leaders as to how a man with a rifle was able to get into a position with a clear line of sight to the former president. Warning: This blog contains some images and information that readers may find distressing. Take a look back at how the events unfolded below. By Andrew Thorpe This is where we'll leave our live coverage of the assassination attempt against former US president Donald Trump. A quick recap: Trump was addressing a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when several loud noises rang out and he dropped to the ground, clutching his ear. With blood on his face, he was then escorted from the stage by Secret Service agents, pausing to raise his fist in the air to chants of \"USA! USA!\" from the crowd. It later emerged 20-year-old Pennsylvania man Thomas Matthew Crooks had fired several shots at Trump from a rooftop outside the rally venue, before being shot dead by police snipers. One rallygoer was killed and two others remain in a critical condition. Trump's campaign says he is doing fine. It is the first time a US president or former president has been wounded in an assassination attempt in more than four decades. I'll leave you with this piece from North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan, who has taken a look at the broader consequences of the shooting, and how it's likely to impact the presidential contest. By Andrew Thorpe Donald Trump has posted for the  second time on his Truth Social platform since the assassination attempt, saying it was \"God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening\". \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" he wrote. You can read the full statement below. By Andrew Thorpe The ABC's global affairs editor John Lyons says it's incumbent on everyone involved in US politics right now — including Donald Trump — to \"lower the temperature\" of the political discourse in the wake of Trump's assassination attempt. \"Already there are conspiracy theories going around on social media in America [that are] completely untrue,\" he says. \"The major one is that Donald Trump's Secret Service detail had been reduced — in other words, trying to blame the Biden administration for this. \"In fact, that's not true. Donald Trump has repeatedly praised his security detail. He's very close to them, they've been sitting behind him in his various court cases, and so the fact that he was exposed for political reasons by [his] opposition is untrue. \"Somehow, Donald Trump as well has to try to calm that down.\" Lyons points out that as Trump was being escorted off the stage by his protective agents, he shouted out \"Fight, fight.\" \"Sure, these were very emotional times, he was obviously traumatised — someone had just tried to kill him — but even that sort of rhetoric, to the unhinged extremes in America, it's very, very dangerous.\" By Andrew Thorpe Leaders from around the world have condemned the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, mostly following a very similar pattern — they're appalled or sickened by the incident, political violence is never acceptable, their thoughts are with the victims and they're praying for Trump's speedy recovery. The Kremlin's statement is a little different. \"Moscow does not think that the attempt to eliminate the politican was organised by the current government,\" it reads. \"However, the atmosphere created around Trump [by the current administration] provoked the attack. \"Putin does not plan to call Trump.\" By Andrew Thorpe It looks like the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability will  be formally investigating the shooting, in addition to the FBI's investigation. Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle — a Biden appointee who worked for PepsiCo before joining the Secret Service in 1995 — has been asked to testify before Congress on Monday, July 22. By Andrew Thorpe James Comer, a Republican congressman who chairs a congressional oversight committee, has questions over how a man with a rifle was able to get into a position with a clear line of sight to the former president. \"I have already contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and am also calling on Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing,\" he says. \"The Oversight Committee will send a formal invitation soon.\" The ABC's Brett Worthington has the full story here: By Andrew Thorpe The New York Times has posted an incredible photo that appears to show a bullet streaking past Donald Trump's head at the moment of his assassination attempt. They've spoken to a retired FBI special agent, who says the shutter speed with which the photo was taken means it's likely the image has in fact captured \"the displacement of air due to a projectile\" — even if capturing such a photo would be a \"one-in-a-million shot\". By Andrew Thorpe The FBI has identified the suspected Trump rally shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park, close to where the rally was held. He was not carrying identification, so his identity was confirmed using DNA analysis, the bureau said. His exact motives for the shooting are still unclear. A registered Republican, he nevertheless donated to a progressive political action committee on the day President Biden was sworn in. The ABC's Annika Burgess has taken a look at what we know about Crooks — including his small-town background, and the weapon he likely used in the attack. By Liana Walker Former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison tells NewsRadio today's events showed Donald Trump is a \"tough and determined\" character. \"I think that imagery [after Trump was shot] will send a strong message about him,\" says Morrison, who met with Trump in May. \"It was a strong and defiant President Trump there, within seconds of being literally under fire.\" He tells the program the United States has a \"vibrant\" democracy with a culture different to Australia's. \"It will prevail, it will get through today as it's got through these times in the past,\" he says. By Andrew Thorpe The ABC News Verify team has been working overtime today dealing with the flood of pictures and videos coming from the scene. Here's what they've been able to reconstruct of the incident, from multiple live video feeds, maps, emergency reports and eyewitness videos and accounts. You can watch the video above, or read the story below: By Andrew Thorpe Celebrity news site TMZ has obtained footage taken by a rally attendee, which the ABC has verified, showing Thomas Matthew Crooks lying on the roof and aiming a rifle, moments before he opens fire and is shot by snipers. The footage drives home the amount of time Crooks had to line up his shot — at least long enough to be spotted and filmed by people on the ground a significant distance away. By Andrew Thorpe No matter how you try to slice it, the fact someone was able to set up on a rooftop with a line of sight to Trump while carrying a rifle is a failure on the part of the Secret Service. While former presidents do receive a level of Secret Service protection, Trump's status as the presumptive nominee of a major party means he is eligible to receive a similar level of protection to that of a sitting president. Areas near the site of a pre-planned event like a presidential campaign rally would typically be cleared by agents well ahead of time, even if they are outside the cordoned-off area that makes up the rally venue itself. As Pennsylvania police stated, an open-air venue makes achieving that level of security more difficult — but an obvious vantage point like the one from which the shooter fired should have been locked down without question. Not to mention that rallygoers say they were able to see the shooter on the roof while Trump was speaking, and alerted police minutes before the first shot was fired. ABC reporter Annika Burgess has that story here: By Tessa Flemming  An update on Trump via the Republican National Committee website. \"As was communicated earlier this evening, President Trump is doing well and grateful to law enforcement and first responders for their fast action,\" the statement on the RNC website read. \"President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States. \"As our party's nominee, President Trump will continue to share his vision to Make America Great Again.\" By Tessa Flemming  By Tessa Flemming  Here's what we know so far about the man the FBI identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks. By Tessa Flemming  The airspace over Bethel Park, the hometown of the suspect in the Trump rally shooting has been closed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA said on Sunday airspace was closed \"effective immediately\" for special security reasons. By Tessa Flemming   Slippery Rock mayor Jondavid Longo, whose town neighbours Butler, was in attendance at today's rally. He says he heard the \"crack of gunshots\" which he initially— in disbelief—thought was a \"firecracker\". \"Certainly not something here in the heart of Butler County which is a staunch Trump territory, certainly not here,\" he tells ABC News channel. Mr Longo says he quickly covered his wife and then scanned the immediate vicinity. It was then he saw a bloodied Trump, which elicited a \"a mix of emotions\". \"Of course, it was inspirational to see President Trump stand up and shove his fist in the air to let us know he was OK but more than that (that) he was still in the fight with us,\" Mr Longo said. \"It was also a sense of relief in that my family and friends around me were safe.\" Watch the full interview below: By Tessa Flemming  Associated Press is also reporting the FBI has named Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, as the subject involved in Trump's assassination attempt. AP adds the suspect comes from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The town about 70km from Butler, the site of the rally. By Tessa Flemming  Reuters is reporting the FBI has identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the \"subject involved\" in the attempted assassination of Trump. By Dannielle Maguire The Associated Press is reporting the shooter is a 20-year-old man from Pennsylvania. \"Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press the assailant who opened fire at the rally was a 20-year-old man from Pennsylvania. \"They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that hadn’t yet been publicly released.\" This comes after FBI special agent Kevin Rojek told a press conference he was not identifying the shooter. We still have not had confirmation of the shooter's name.  And we have not had any confirmation about the shooter's motive.

Trump was in the city of Butler in Pennsylvania, 590 kilometres west of New York City and 53km from the city of Pittsburgh.  The former president began speaking to a large crowd gathered shortly after 5pm Eastern Time in Butler, Pennsylvania. (AP: Evan Vucci) He was attending an afternoon rally as part of his campaign ahead of the November 5 presidential election, and was scheduled to speak at 5pm Eastern Time (7am AEST). He has not yet announced his running mate for vice-president, and was expected to make that call this week.  Video of the incident shows Trump, wearing his signature red MAGA hat, stepping onstage waving to the song God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood.  To the sides of the stage are huge signs with \"Pennsylvania is Trump Country\" as a giant American flag hovers overhead.  Trump was speaking about illegal immigration onstage when a shooter opened fire. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) He begins making claims about immigration numbers since the 2020 election. Mid-sentence, the former president stops talking as a popping sound rings out and he grabs his right ear.  Donald Trump grabs his ear on stage before ducking to the ground after shots were heard. Supporters gathered behind him start to scream and duck for cover as more popping noises are heard.  Trump looks around him and then drops behind the lectern as Secret Service agents can be heard shouting: \"Get down, get down, get down, get down.\" Secret Service agents rushed the stage to cover the former president after he was grazed on the ear by a bullet. (AP: Evan Vucci) The agents form a pile on top of Trump as more shots are heard and the crowd descends into screams. \"What are we doing? What are we doing?\" can be heard from the microphones onstage. It appears there is just a two-second gap from the first popping sound to the third.  Donald Trump sheltered behind a lectern onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, as blood ran down his face. (Getty: Anna Moneymaker) A fourth round of popping sounds rings out as more Secret Service agents run onstage and form a huddle before three heavily armed soldiers with assault rifles join them as they prepare to move Trump away.  \"Hold, hold. Are you ready? Onto you. Move! Move!\" \"Go, go.\" We can hear someone shouting: \"Hawkeye's here.\"   Hawkeye is a special counter-assault team that's part of the Secret Service, which guards all former and current US presidents and their families.  One of the agents says \"shooter's down\" which is repeated by another agent.  \"Shooter's down,\" is heard again several times. Secret Service agents surrounded the former president in a protective huddle after he was injured. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Once a soldier in black fatigues is in position on the stage, the agents say \"we're clear\" and allow Trump to stand up from where he has been crouching behind the lectern.  He asks them to \"let me get my shoes\" twice. \"I got you, sir. I got you, sir,\" he is told. \"Hold on, your head is bloody,\" one of the agents says. The former president has a bloodied ear and cheek as he's lifted up by the circle of Secret Service agents. Mr Trump asked the agents to wait before escorting him offstage, saying \"let me get my shoes\". (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) The crowd starts to cheer and clap as Trump stands, evidently relieved he appears not to be seriously injured.  The former president looks shaken, but as his Secret Service detail begins to escort him off stage he asks them to \"wait\" and puts a defiant first in the air to further screams and cheers from the people in the stands around him.  Donald Trump raises a fist after shots were fired at a rally, grazing his ear. July 14 2024. (AP: Gene J. Puskar) They erupt in a chant of \"USA\" as he moves offstage in a huddle, half-carried by his security detail, shaking his fist repeatedly.  The agents bundle him towards a waiting black SUV parked to the side of the stage as people continue to cheer and scream.  Trump raises his fist again before being whisked away with his team in the car.  A group of Secret Service agents bundles Trump into a car to take him to a local medical facility. (AP: Evan Vucci) Trump's campaign team put out a statement shortly after the incident saying that the former president was \"fine\" and that he was being given medical attention at a local facility.  \"President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act,\" spokesperson Steven Cheung said. Trump was bundled into a waiting black SUV by his security detail as the rally descended into chaos. (AP: Evan Vucci) Trump posted on social media several hours after the incident that \"much bleeding\" took place after hearing the sound of shots. \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,\" he wrote.  Authorities have said two people are dead, including the shooter, and two are critically injured. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) The Secret Service confirmed in a statement that the shooter and a rally attendee were dead, and two more people were critically injured.  The rally location has been declared an active crime scene after police evacuated people from the site. President Joe Biden said \"there is no place in America for this kind of violence\" in a press conference shortly after the incident.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Law, Crime and Justice US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

An attendee was killed and two others were critically injured. The shooter, who was on the roof of a nearby building, was also killed.  The FBI and other agencies are investigating what they've called an assassination attempt. Donald Trump has thanked Secret Service agents who rushed him off stage during a shooting at a campaign rally that left an audience member dead and two others critically injured. Mr Trump said a bullet grazed his ear before he was taken away, with his fist in the air and blood on his face, during the incident in Butler, in western Pennsylvania. The shooter, who the FBI named as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed, authorities said. Screams tore through the crowd and Mr Trump grabbed at the side of his face and ducked behind a riser during the shooting, which is now being investigated by the FBI and Secret Service as an assassination attempt. Secret Service agents rushed Donald Trump off the stage. (AP: Evan Vucci) In the early hours of Sunday, local time, the FBI confirmed the identity of the shooter as 20-year-old Crooks. Earlier, the local county district attorney, Richard Goldinger, told America's ABC News the shooter had been on the roof of an adjacent venue, so did not go through security screening. FBI Special Agent Kevin Rojek said investigators were working to identify a motive. There was no reason to believe there was any ongoing threat, Pennsylvania State Police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said. \"We are absolutely not taking for granted that this was a lone wolf attack,\" he said. \"And so we would be looking at additional information that could point us to anyone else that may have had a hand in this.\" In an earlier statement, the Secret Service said \"multiple shots were fired from an elevated position outside of the rally venue\". \"US Secret Service personnel neutralised the shooter, who is now dead,\" it said. The Trump campaign released a statement shortly after the shooting that said he was \"fine\". Mr Trump is covered by Secret Service agents on the stage.  (AP: Evan Vucci) Later, Mr Trump posted to social media: \"I want to thank The United States Secret Service, and all of law enforcement, for their rapid response on the shooting that just took place in Butler, Pennsylvania.  \"Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured.  \"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.  \"Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead.  \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.  \"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.  \"Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening.  \"GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" Mr Trump was surrounded by security at the campaign rally. (AP) US President Joe Biden has spoken to Mr Trump, the White House said. Earlier, the president described the attack as \"sick\". \"It's one reason we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. \"The idea that there's political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of. \"Everybody must condemn it.\" Mr Trump has left hospital, according to US media. It's the first apparent assassination attempt on a US president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Police began vacating the area shortly after Mr Trump left the stage. Some attendees were in tears. Republican congressman Ronny Jackson said his nephew was wounded at the rally.  \"He was grazed in the neck. A bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding,\" he told Fox News. Police snipers returned fire after the shots rang out at the rally. (AP: Gene J Puskar) Bryant Brzozowski described the scene as \"crazy\". \"I was behind the former president, so I didn't see what happened. We just got down, and I covered two little girls when other people covered my fiance,\" Mr Brzozowski told the ABC. He said he saw police and paramedics attending to a man, dressed in a shirt displaying an American flag, who was lying on the ground. \"I don't know if it was a shooter or somebody who got shot,\" he said. \"All I saw was he was holding his stomach when the other two paramedics or cops were attending to him.\" An aerial map showing the location of the stage and the location of the gunman. (ABC News) Corey Cumisckey, who was at the event with his wife and children, told the ABC nothing seemed out of the ordinary before the shots were heard. \"Trump was talking and all of a sudden some shots rang out, or what sounded like shots, and then there was some return fire,\" he said. \"I kind of got up to see what was going on. And they had the president on the ground. And then, you know, a couple of seconds possibly later, they came up with him and off the stage he went.\" Donald Trump grabs his ear on stage after shots were heard at a rally.  Mr Cumisckey said his wife was \"extremely upset\" and questioned whether her children should have been at the event. \"I disagree. I think you should be able to bring your kids to an event like this and it's unacceptable for something like this to happen,\" he said.  Secret Service agents watch the crowd after the shooting.  (AP: Evan Vucci) \"It's really unfortunate that things have heated up to this level.\" Mr Trump is due to be endorsed as the Republicans' presidential candidate at the party's national convention in Milwaukee, which begins on Monday. The rally in Butler was the last one scheduled before the convention. The convention will go ahead as planned.  \"President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th president of the United States,\" a statement from the Republican National Committee said. His son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted a photo of his father shortly after the shooting. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, thanked well-wishers for their \"love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today's senseless violence\". \"I love you Dad, today and always,\" she tweeted. Republican congressman Steve Scalise, who survived a shooting in 2017, blamed Democrat leaders for \"fuelling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America\". Former president Bill Clinton said he and wife Hillary, who ran against Mr Trump in the 2016 election, were \"heartbroken for all those affected\".  Australia's ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said it was a relief Mr Trump was safe. \"All Australians are shocked by the attack on former president Trump at his campaign rally this evening in Pennsylvania,\" he said.  \"Violence has no place in our democracies.\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson posted on social media that he was praying for Trump.

(Four Corners: Christopher Gillette, Reuters: Marco Bello) The last thing I expect to get sitting in Anthony Scaramucci's Manhattan boardroom is a lesson in astrology. But when you're talking Donald Trump, the conversation can veer in any direction. \"He fits his astrological sign, the Gemini, where there's like two people inside of one body,\" says Scaramucci, who is wearing white sneakers with his investment banker business suit. \"He has a soft side to him and can be charitable. And then the flip side is a man that's loaded up with a lot of anger and mendacity, also some self-loathing and high levels of narcissism.\" Anthony Scaramucci had known Donald Trump for years before he was asked to work with him. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) Scaramucci is one of several former White House insiders from Trump's first term as president who I've sat down with in recent months in a bid to understand more about the man — and his next mission. The United States is fast approaching what could be a pivotal moment in its democracy if Trump is re-elected in November, and those who had a front row seat the first time around aren't holding back. Scaramucci has known The Donald for two decades. The New Yorkers hit it off while working at TV network NBC; investment guru Scaramucci was a finance commentator, billionaire businessman Trump was hosting hit reality show The Apprentice. \"He lives in a triplex apartment, this sort of garish, triplex apartment. It'd be like if [King of France] Louis the 14th smoked crystal meth and then decorated,\" Scaramucci says.  \"You would think that with that kind of wealth, he would be an insider. But he's sort of shunned by the establishment, so this gives him this huge chip on his shoulder.\" Donald Trump is seeking a return to the White House. (Reuters: Marco Bello) Scaramucci cites a story he says he heard about Trump \"where he wasn't invited to a country club that he was desperate to get into … one of these famous golf clubs out here. And so then he went on to build 18 golf courses\". Trump's companies currently own 15 golf courses and have three more planned. When Trump won the Republican nomination for president in 2016, he convinced Scaramucci to join his team. \"My wife didn't want me to go work for him … But I didn't listen.\"  \"I engaged my ego and my pride, which are obviously your enemies in life. When I got fired, unceremoniously, I stayed loyal to him.\" After being part of Trump's transition team, the president appointed Scaramucci as White House director of communications, reporting directly to him. He lasted just 11 days. He was sacked after having what he thought was an off-the-record chat with a journalist in which he proffered expletive-filled character assessments of his colleagues. \"He's incredibly transactional,\" Scaramucci says of Trump. \"He'll socialise with you and be charming and gregarious and get you to do something for him. And then if it serves his interest to run you over with the car, he'll run you over with the car.\" Scaramucci's loyalty only stretched so far. Trump labelled him a disgruntled former employee, tweeting: \"I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence.\" Today Scaramucci points to a report by The Washington Post's Fact Checker team that Trump made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims over his four-year term. \"Mr Trump has practised the big lie for five decades, and it works for him,\" he says. \"We're living in a … post-truth society … and he represents that\" Miles Taylor isn't so eloquent in his assessment of Trump. \"He's just a f***ing idiot,\" he says. Taylor was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security but he's more famous for being \"Anonymous\", the unnamed senior official who penned an excoriating portrait of the dysfunction inside the Trump administration for The New York Times in 2018. As we meet in Virginia, he tells me Trump wasn't up to the top job. Miles Taylor, AKA Anonymous, leaked information about Donald Trump to The New York Times. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) \"When Donald Trump was president, I remember crossing that threshold into the Oval Office, and not only was this guy not bringing his A game, he didn't have a game. He was winging it,\" he says. \"We would often find him in meetings completely distracted. He would go off on tangents and tirades. He would often repeat himself.\" Taylor says Trump's office was \"like a crowded New York bagel shop\". \"You might be talking about a classified issue and someone who doesn't have a security clearance comes walking through … and he's getting phone calls and he's telling people to tweet things out.\" Taylor's most bizarre interaction with Trump was when he says the president phoned with an idea to build a moat along the southern border with Mexico in a bid to stop migrants crossing into the US. \"And he goes off on this tangent talking about how we should actually get snakes and alligators and fill this 2000-mile moat on the border so that if someone falls into the moat … they're facing the threat of snakes and alligators who might come after them.\" \"He's just a f***ing idiot.\" Taylor says the team provided a back-of-the-envelope cost estimate for the project, which Trump then said was too expensive. Trump has previously called the moat story and the New York Times article \"fake news\". Taylor says he's a lifelong conservative and \"more Republican than Donald Trump\". \"But putting politics aside, engaging with the man, you realise he's an idiot. He is highly incompetent.\" Two years after writing the New York Times article — which Trump had previously suggested was an act of \"treason\" — Taylor resigned and outed himself. Trump tweeted that he'd never heard of him (despite them being photographed together in the Oval Office) before saying he should be prosecuted. Taylor isn't the only former senior administration official reportedly labelled a traitor by Trump and his supporters. Of the six men who served as Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton lasted the longest, at 17 months. I've travelled to Washington DC to meet with Bolton, as well as several intelligence experts, former ambassadors and government officials. John Bolton advised Trump on national security.  (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) Bolton says he thought the weight of the office of the president would instil discipline into Trump. He was wrong. \"Frequently, he was the one doing most of the talking during the intelligence briefings,\" he says. \"He had huge gaps in his knowledge of international affairs. \"He once asked White House chief of staff John Kelly if Finland was still part of Russia. It went downhill from there.\" Trump has accused Bolton of making up stories about their time working together. Bolton recalls trying to brief Trump while they were flying on Air Force One to a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Bolton was attempting to explain the comparative nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US, he claims Trump was transfixed on a FIFA World Cup football match on TV. But of deeper concern to Bolton was Trump's apparent infatuation with Putin. \"I do think he felt envious of the autocrats, because they could do pretty much what they wanted without constraint,\" he says.  \"They seemed like big guys. They were tough and confident, and I think he wanted to emulate them. Although he didn't exactly know how.\" For every critic of Trump I meet in the US capital though, there's an ally with a different story. Former senior Trump administration official Gordon Sondland scoffs at the idea that the former president was in awe of dictators and despots and wanted to be like them. Former ambassador Gordon Sondland backs Donald Trump. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) \"I remember being with President Trump shortly after he met with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un,\" says the former ambassador to the European Union. \"And the media was excoriating him over being too friendly … as if he was seduced by this short Korean man who is a murderer and a thug.\" \"We were in the car, and I said, 'Mr President, cutting through the bullshit, tell me about Kim Jong Un.'\"  \"And he looked at me with a smile and he said, 'If that motherf***er had a knife, he could have gored me in the stomach.'\" \"That told me everything I needed to know about his soberness when it came to these people.\" Like many other senior administration officials, Sondland was eventually sacked by the president. He acknowledges Trump is not a conventional leader but says he can be a man of the people. \"A lot of presidents would stay up until the early hours reading thick briefing books,\" Sondland says. \"That's not how Trump got his information. He got his information over the telephone and in person … in fact, the joke was he would ask the janitor who was mopping the floor, 'What do you think about this or that?'\" Former acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf says his interactions with Trump were always about what was best for the American people. \"I don't know anyone who loves their country more and is more patriotic than the president,\" he says. \"He's a great boss. He's a challenging boss. He wants results at the end of the day. And I think he pushed us.\" Chad Wolf says Donald Trump is a patriot. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) In 2020, The Washington Post reported that Wolf was one of Trump's favourite cabinet secretaries because he did not push back at the president's ideas like his predecessors did. Wolf agrees that there needs to be people surrounding a leader who will challenge them when necessary, but says in Trump's first term some staffers and government agency personnel didn't understand how it works. \"Instead, they continue to say, 'Well, it's a bad idea,' and, 'My opinion's more important than yours, even though I wasn't elected,'\" he says. \"If you're not on board with the president's agenda, you need to step aside.\" Some tip that should Trump be re-elected, he will once again appoint Wolf to a senior post. \"You need people to salute and say, 'I got it,'\" Wolf says. Should he win back the presidency, Trump has vowed to pursue \"retribution\" for himself and the Americans who feel they've been left behind by wokeism and liberal politics. But the plan for his second coming isn't all talk; he's supported by a coalition of conservative groups with a plan for power known as Project 2025, and has made dismantling institutions in Washington that he feels have wronged him, such as the Department of Justice, a top priority. That sends a chill up the spine of Peter Strzok. Peter Strzok's team investigated interference in the election Donald Trump won. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) Strzok was a senior official in the FBI's Counterintelligence Division who led the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election won by Trump. He was forced to resign when private texts that denigrated Trump were made public. \"According to The Washington Post, I was the first person — dubious honour — that he accused of treason,\" Strzok says. Treason carries the death penalty in the US. The counterintelligence specialist, though, believes it's Trump who is a threat to the United States and the constitution. \"If you look at it from an intelligence professional's perspective, Trump is a counterintelligence nightmare,\" he says.  \"He had very well-known alleged proclivities for pretty women. He had … susceptibility to flattery [and] a strange sort of affection for strong men and authoritarians … Trump hit so many of these different areas that were in fact intelligence vulnerabilities.\" Then there's the fact Trump is now a convicted felon — in May he was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign – and is facing the prospect of three more criminal trials. The three trials will allege Trump conspired to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden, unlawfully tried to change the outcome in Georgia, and mishandled classified documents after he left office. Trump denies any wrongdoing in the first trial and has pleaded not guilty in the other two. \"If you go back and you look at the entire history of the United States of America, no current or former president has been indicted, ever, let alone for, initially, 91 criminal counts,\" Strzok says. Anthony Scaramucci is no longer loyal to Donald Trump. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) Back in Anthony Scaramucci's Manhattan boardroom, I ask him who he is going to vote for come November. \"I'm a lifelong Republican. I don't agree with a lot of the Biden policies,\" he says. \"But I'm willing to accept four years of policies I may not agree with to ensure that we don't have a direct threat to the system that's made the country so prosperous and so, so peaceful.\" Scaramucci knows though, that millions of his countrymen and women are itching to see Trump return. \"He's their great white hope, or their great orange hope. He is the orange wrecking ball that can smash into these institutions that they feel have been unfair to them.\" Donald Trump did not respond to an interview request from Four Corners.

Mr Trump has survived the shooting, which is being investigated as an assassination attempt. More details are expected on the suspected shooter, who was killed in the incident, and possible motives, as the FBI undertakes an investigation. Several minutes before a series of shots were fired towards Donald Trump at a political rally in the United States, a gunman was spotted on a nearby rooftop, according to witnesses. Mr Trump was in the middle of a speech when the volley of \"pops\" were heard. The former president grabbed at his ear, and blood was seen streaming down his face as he was swarmed by Secret Service agents. He turned to the crowd and lifted his fists in the air before being escorted off stage. The incident at the event in Butler County, Pennsylvania, is being investigated as an assassination attempt. A witness, named Greg, told the BBC he had alerted to police to a man sprawled on top of a building just outside the event. He was surprised that Mr Trump's speech was still allowed to go ahead. \"I'm thinking to myself 'Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage' … the next thing you know, five shots ring out,\" he said in a video interview. Secret Service agents rushed Donald Trump off the stage. (AP: Evan Vucci) Mr Trump's campaign say he was \"fine\". The suspected gunman and at least one attendee are dead, local prosecutors said. Greg said he tried to alert the authorities for three to four minutes. He believes they were unable to see the suspected gunman due to the slope of the roof. \"Why is there not Secret Service on all of these roofs here?\" he asked.  \"This is not a big place.\" Another witness shared a similar story with CBS news. He said while he and other attendees were waiting for Mr Trump to take the stage, they noticed two police officers \"looking for something or somebody\". \"I was looking around myself and seen [sic] a guy on top of one of the building go in-between one of the buildings to the next,\" he said. \"I went and told the officer he was up there, and when I went back to my spot, people could still see the person from where they were standing.\" He tried to tell the officers where to position themselves to see the suspected gunman. But at that point, \"that's when the shots started\".  Authorities have confirmed the suspected gunman was positioned on a roof on a building outside the event.  A series of shots, two dead and a bloodied ear: what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania at the former president's campaign rally. Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said the suspect fired \"multiple shots toward the stage\" and was on \"an elevated position\" outside the rally venue.  Images from the scene show a building surrounded by authorities, positioned over Mr Trump's right shoulder from where he was was speaking. Those who attend Mr Trump's campaign rallies are subject to security screenings and their belongings are searched for weapons.  There are also typically law-enforcement officials stationed on nearby rooftops when possible. Mr Trump asked the agents to wait before escorting him offstage, saying \"let me get my shoes\". (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) The witness who spoke to the BBC said they could clearly see the man on the roof holding a rifle.  \"He had a rifle, we could clearly see a rifle,\" he said. \"We're pointing at him, the police are down there running around on the ground, we're like 'Hey man, there's a guy on the roof with a rifle' … and the police did not know what was going on,\" he said.  He later saw police shoot the gunman. \"They crawled up on the roof, they had their guns pointed at him, made sure he was dead. He was dead, and that was it — it was over.\" Police snipers returned fire after the shots rang out at the rally. (AP: Gene J Puskar) The attack was the first attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Professor Claire Finkelstein from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said the assassination attempt had been \"very close\". \"As we know, the shooter was shooting from the right hand side at an elevated position,\" she told ABC News. \"No weapons should get into the immediate area, given the the searches that they do and the equipment that they have for searching for weapons. \"But it's very difficult to control an outdoor area, and all of the positions from which a shooter could fire with a long gun.\"  The FBI early Sunday named Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the shooter in the assassination attempt. The agency said the investigation remains active and ongoing. The political leanings of Crooks were not immediately clear.  Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $US15 to a progressive political action committee on January 20, 2021, the day President Joe Biden was sworn into office. Professor Finkelstein said given a rise in violent rhetoric around political events, future outdoor rallies may be called off. She noted similarities with the John F Kennedy assassination in 1963. \"[He] was famously killed in an open air circumstance in some similar way from somebody at an elevated position on a building at a lookout site,\" Professor Finkelstein said. \"When you are in an open air situation, security is very tenuous at best. And that may mean they are, for now, simply be off the table.\" Mr Trump was surrounded by security at the campaign rally. (AP) Professor Finkelstein said more about the motives of the shooter was likely to unfold in the coming days and weeks. But, like with the Kennedy assassination, there may never be a full picture, especially not by the time of the November election.

Just hours before his own assassination, president Abraham Lincoln signed the paperwork to establish the Secret Service in 1865. Initially tasked with combating currency counterfeiting, the Secret Service took on protecting the US president after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901.  Donald Trump, as a former president, still has Secret Service protection. (AP: Evan Vucci) Today, the Secret Service maintains permanent protection on the president and vice-president, their families and their predecessors. It also offers temporary protection to high-profile politicians, presidential candidates and visiting heads of state.  The Secret Service includes both highly-visible bodyguards and advancers that assess threats in before the politician arrives at an event. The bodyguards were the first to storm the stage and cover Mr Trump when the gunfire rang out in western Pennsylvania. The Associated Press reported that a heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with a president and presidential candidate and is tasked with confronting would-be attackers. Pennsylvania state police, at a press conference after the shooting, said the Secret Service was the lead agency tasked with ensuring Mr Trump's safety. It was also responsible for assessing threats in advance. The Secret Service didn't attend the press conference but in a statement said a suspected shooter fired \"multiple shots\" at Mr Trump, killing one spectator and critically injuring two others. The Secret Service confirmed it killed the shooter, who the FBI later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crook. The attempted assassination occurred at an outdoor afternoon rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.  Mr Trump was standing on a stage when he was shot from a nearby rooftop. Secret Service agents covered Donald Trump after he was shot at a campaign rally. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) The AP is reporting that the roof, despite being outside the campaign event, was less than 150 metres from where Mr Trump was speaking. FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said his agency was working with the Secret Service to determine what precautions the Secret Service had in place before the rally.  Pennsylvania State Police deputy commissioner George Bivens defended the Secret Service and said it was difficult to secure an open venue.  \"In their defence, what I would want to say is it's incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker,\" he said. \"The investigation will really give us an opportunity to take a look at where any failures occurred and what can be done better in the future.\" Witnesses have told news outlets, including the BBC and NBC, that they saw a man climb onto a roof outside the event. They say they flagged what they saw with police.  Rally attendees have told media that they had to pass through security checkpoints, including magnetometers, which are metal detectors commonly used to detect handguns.  The shooter was outside these checkpoints. It's not the first time a US politician has been shot. Four presidents have been assassinated and others shot. In recent years, Democrat Gabby Giffords and Republican Steve Scalise both survived shootings.  In May, a man was sentence to 30 years in prison for attempting to kidnap then-US house speaker Nancy Pelosi and attacking her husband with a hammer. Before that, 13 people were arrested after plotting to kidnap Michigan's governor.  FBI director Christopher Wray in December told a Senate committee that protecting Americans from terrorism was his agency's top priority. He said the terrorism threat was as complex as ever. \"The greatest terrorism threat to our homeland is posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalise to violence online, and who primarily use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets,\" he said. Mr Trump has had a Secret Service detail since 2015. CNN is reporting his protection was strengthened recently but it remains unclear what prompted that. The FBI has confirmed there will be a long investigation into what happened, to determine what took place and how the shooter was able to get into position. That investigation could take months.  In the meantime, the Secret Service is already facing the prospect of congressional summons to answer politicians' questions. Secret Service agents swarmed the stage after Donald Trump was shot. (AP: Evan Vucci) \"There are many questions and Americans demand answers,\" said James Comer, a Republican congressman who chairs a congressional oversight committee. \"I have already contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and am also calling on Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. The Oversight Committee will send a formal invitation soon.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Australia Federal Government Government and Politics US Elections Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Thomas Matthew Crooks has been named as the \"subject involved\" in the incident, the FBI said in a statement. Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service snipers at the scene, was from Bethel Park, close to where the rally was held on Saturday local time. Bethel Park School District released a photo of former Bethel Park High School student Thomas Matthew Crooks.  (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) Bethel Park School District confirmed in a statement that Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022.  This is what we know so far about the suspect and how the shooting played out.  Look back at the day in our live blog as Donald Trump arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention following attempted assassination. Mr Trump was injured when multiple shots were fired at the stage, but the former president's campaign says he is doing \"fine\". The near assassination of Donald Trump was a seminal moment in US history. Through multiple live streams, map data, and eyewitness videos, here’s how the rally shooting played out over 11 minutes and 9 seconds.  One attendee was killed and two critically injured in the incident, according to authorities.  Crooks had not been attending the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He is suspected of carrying out the attack from a rooftop on a building outside the event. Witnesses said they alerted police to a gunman on the roof of the building, which was about 120 metres away from the stage where Mr Trump began giving an address at around 6:02pm (8:02am Sunday AEST). They spotted the suspected shooter several minutes before shots rung out and Mr Trump fell to the ground, rising moments later with blood streaming down his face. The suspected gunman was spotted on the roof of a building about 120 metres from the stage where Donald Trump was speaking.  (ABC News: Digital News Graphics) So far, the FBI has only released Crooks's name, age and where he lived.  They earlier said the gunman was not carrying identification, so they analysed his DNA to provide a biometric confirmation of his identity.  Bethel Park, where Crooks lived, is about an hour south of Butler.  The Federal Aviation Administration said on Sunday that the airspace over the Bethel Park was closed \"effective immediately\" for special security reasons. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a statement from the Bethel Park School District. \"Our school district will cooperate fully with the active law enforcement investigation surrounding this case, and as such, we are limited in what we can publicly disclose,\" the statement read. \"The school district wishes to express its sincere wishes for a speedy and complete recovery for Mr. Trump and those in attendance at the Saturday event who may have been physically harmed or emotionally impacted by these tragic events.\"  He received a $US500 ($740) \"star award\" from the National Maths and Science Initiative, according to a local media report. State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican and the upcoming election would have been the first time he was old enough to vote. When Crooks was 17 he made a $US15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Crooks's father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son. Two officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, saying an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene. A series of shots, two dead and a bloodied ear: what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania at the former president's campaign rally. AR-style rifles are common in mass shootings in the US, said Professor David Smith from the United States Studies Centre. They are affordable, lightweight and semi-automatic, meaning they can fire multiple rounds quickly.  Mr Trump was discussing border crossing numbers when the shots, at least five, were fired. He released a statement on his Truth Social platform describing the moment he was struck. \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,\" he wrote. Up to a dozen of the deadliest mass shootings in the US since 2006 have involved an AR-15. Semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 have been banned in the past, but are currently widely available in most states.  President Joe Biden has been calling to reinstate a nationwide ban that expired in 2004. \"One of my fears is that even though most of the major assassination attempts of the 20th century actually led to significant advances in gun control, this one will not,\" Professor Smith told ABC News channel. \"This doesn't seem like a moment where Americans are going to ask themselves whether things have gone too far with this violence. \"Instead, this seems more like a moment that is going to accelerate the current polarisation.\" The FBI, which is leading the investigation, told reporters that it's too early to say whether the shooter acted alone and have not provided a motive. But police do not believe there is \"any other existing threat out there\". The FBI is calling for people with video of the event or information to share it with authorities. Trump was bundled into a waiting black SUV by his security detail as the rally descended into chaos. (AP: Evan Vucci) Professor Claire Finkelstein from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said we are likely to learn more about possible motives in the coming days. She noted there has been an increase in political violence.  \"We have seen an increase in violent rhetoric around political events of all sorts, and political cause,\" Professor Finkelstein told ABC News.  \"And the irony is, of course, that Trump himself has fomented some of this violent rhetoric.  \"I think this is a lesson to all of us about how dangerous it is for politicians to increase the violent rhetoric around their campaigns and around their causes.\" A group of Secret Service agents bundles Trump into a car to take him to a local medical facility. (AP: Evan Vucci) Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle have briefed President Joe Biden. They are working with law enforcement partners to respond to and investigate the shooting, Mr Mayorkas said on X. Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson also said the House will conduct a full investigation of the attack on Trump's campaign rally. \"The American people deserve to know the truth,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We will have Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and other appropriate officials from DHS and the FBI appear for a hearing before our committees ASAP.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Analysis by Jade Macmillan Shootings US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Does your dad sometimes yell for you when he is actually talking to the dog?  Misnaming is a common cognitive slip which has been in the spotlight after US President Joe Biden's unfortunate press conference where he mixed up the name of his own vice-president Kamala Harris with his political nemesis, Donald Trump. Earlier, Mr Biden had to correct himself after introducing Ukrainian's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\" to an audience of journalists. The gaffes have not helped quell growing speculation about the fitness of the current president to do the job for another four years if he wins another term in November. However, brain scientists say misnaming people is not always a sign of cognitive decline, but rather a \"common slip-up\" that can be brought on by stress, not enough sleep, or a lack of concentration.  Clinical Neuropsychologist and Senior Research Fellow at Flinders University Stephanie Wong said the brain tends to group names which are related or sound the same.  Under stress, without proper sleep, or if we are not concentrating, the brain will reach for those similar sounding or grouped names when we speak.  That is why family members commonly misname one another, and could be an explanation of Mr Biden's mix-up with Ms Harris and Mr Trump.  \"It seems to be related to the way our brains process language,\" Dr Wong said.  \"When you bring to mind one thing, it is likely that your brain will also be activating similar neural patterns for related names or objects. \"And so, because it's sort of like a network, the likelihood you might bring up a related name is higher, because they're all kind of linked, and stored in close proximity.\"  Dr Stephanie Wong said under certain conditions the brain will reach for similar sounding or grouped names when we speak. (Supplied) A study from researchers at Duke University in 2016 found misnaming happening most frequently between family members and close friends — regardless of age.  Sorting names into categories is one way our brains try to keep up with the onslaught of information  we take in when awake.  \"Really, this is an efficiency thing,\" Dr Wong said.  \"The brain kind of organises names that are similar in a similar sort of region so that this information can be kind of retrieved faster.\" Neuroscientist Damian Holsinger from the University of Sydney specialises in Alzheimer's disease and said it would be unfair to assume Mr Biden is in a state of cognitive decline based only on naming slip-ups.  \"There is no correlation,\" he said. \"This is probably aged-related memory decline, not dementia.\"  Dr Holsinger said brains do not produce new neurons, the nerve cells which send and receive messages to your brain, and so over time the total number starts to decline. The ability to forget and remember varies from person to person, say experts, but we need a balance of both. \"From about the age of 40 onwards, the entire body starts slowing down. As we age, we do forget things.\" However, age is not the only thing which might cause a brain to reach for the wrong name. Sleep plays a critical role in memory and retention.  \"Sleep is critically important, we have linked sleep, to memory loss, dementia,\" Dr Holsinger said.  \"When we sleep it gives our body and our brains time to actually get rid of all the toxins that are in the system.\" So, should you be worried if you start calling your mum the name of your goldfish? Dr Wong said while it is good to be cautious, you are probably fine.  \"Slipping-up saying the wrong name is very common,\" she said. \"But if this is something that is quite uncharacteristic, and if it does become particularly worse, then someone might be worried about cognitive decline or dementia\".  Dr Holsinger admits he is often apologising for calling someone by the wrong name.  \"I actually do say that to people, I'm sorry, I'm really bad with names,\" he said.  It can feel like some people are more likely to get it wrong than others, and Dr Holsinger thinks that could be true.  \"Every single person is different, and there are certain things I emphasise that you may not. \"You might actually be very focused on people's names, right? For me, the face of the person and the person's behaviour is probably more important than the person's name.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:World Politics Analysis by Virginia Trioli Topic:World Politics Topic:Explainer Alzheimer's and Dementia Public Health Sleep US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

What started as a peaceful rally on a sunny Saturday afternoon ended in chaos and confusion as a volley of shots were fired at former president Donald Trump, leaving him alive, but with blood streaming from his ear. Here's what ABC News Verify has been able to determine from multiple live video feeds, map data, emergency reports, and eyewitness videos and accounts. As more footage from the event continues to emerge, questions are now being raised as to why authorities were unable to stop the former president from being shot. Follow our live coverage of the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump.  The rally was being held here at the Butler Fairground, about 55km north of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. Special stands and a stage had been erected at the site for the event. Trump had been billed to take the stage at 5pm local time but doesn't appear until about 34 seconds past 6:02pm, when the song \"God Bless the USA\" by Lee Greenwood plays him in. The rally stage is facing to the north-west with audience stands behind, and those three buildings you can see in the satellite imagery directly behind them. To Trump's left there is another series of large buildings and a car park. After greeting the audience, Trump officially takes the stage. His first words into the microphone are \"this is a big crowd, this is a big, big beautiful crowd.\" A video that began circulating after the initial publication of this story shows the shooter — revealed by the FBI to be 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks — crawling across the roof next to the fairground car park. The eyewitness video shows Crooks lying on his side 111 seconds before he shoots Trump. The actual shooting isn't shown, but ABC News Verify has matched the audio in the video of the former president speaking against live feeds of the rally to determine the timing. As the shooter begins to move, a man tries to grab the attention of an off-screen police officer before a woman is heard yelling \"he's on the roof!\". At 25 seconds past 6:11pm, a rally attendee near the shooter's position shouts out \"he's got a gun!\" as people around him panic. Video posted by TMZ shows the long-haired man in a prone firing position on a building near the car park, north of the stage. A live stream feed from Right Side Broadcasting network — corroborated with live feeds from Associated Press and Reuters — shows the first shot was heard at 33 seconds past 6:11pm Eastern Daylight Time. Footage taken by a rally attendee and posted on TikTok shows a sniper appearing to react quickly. Looking northwards, Trump is showing a graph about US immigration figures and says \"take a look at what happened\" when he is cut off. Three shots can be heard from the same weapon in under three seconds. Between the first and second shots, the former president clutches his ear and winces slightly, indicating the first bullet found its mark. The second shot rings out and Trump begins to crouch behind his podium. Crowd members behind him holding \"You're Fired\" placards — the catchphrase Trump used when hosting the reality TV show The Apprentice — begin to realise what is happening. The third shot is heard, and three members of his security team are almost instantly on top of Trump, shielding him with their bodies. Four seconds later, another four shots are heard, followed by a rapid three-shot burst from what sounds like a different firearm. Then, 11 seconds later, there is one more gunshot. While there is extensive vision of snipers positioned around the rally site, at the time of publication it is unclear who killed the shooter, and from where they were firing from. Eyewitness video taken in the aftermath shows the shooter's body on a building next to the northern car park approximately 130 metres away from the stage where Trump was speaking. It's still unclear exactly how Crooks accessed the rooftop without being stopped, but street map data and satellite imagery of the location shows multiple access points, including from the adjacent buildings and car park. As more Secret Service agents and armed escorts rush to Trump's side, the microphone picks up the security team trying to coordinate their exit strategy. Footage taken by Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford shows the guards trying to get the former president up on his feet. Screams of \"We love you, Trump!\" are heard from the crowd. The security team is ready to move after a path from the stage to his SUV is cleared. Trump is heard asking to collect his shoes before leaving. Meanwhile, approximately 50 metres north of the stage, bystanders try to help a person who had been shot in the crossfire. Police in the live feed and in eyewitness video are seen carrying a bloodied victim away. An unnamed emergency department doctor wearing a USA T-shirt covered in blood is later filmed describing how the victim had been shot in the head and the man had attempted to save their life with CPR. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Gugliemi would announce later that in addition to the gunman, one audience member was killed and another two were critically injured. Back on stage, Trump raises his fist in the air and the crowd cheers, chanting \"USA\" as his team escorts him down the stairs and off the stage. It takes 22 seconds for him to reach his vehicle. Trump throws out one last fist pump to the crowd before a few more agents enter behind him and close the door. His vehicle begins driving away at 41 seconds past 6:13pm EDT. It all took just 11 minutes and nine seconds.

One X user posted photos from a location in the US on Sunday (local time), where physical retailers were already selling similar products. Within hours of the shooting, products with Vucci's photo could also be found on Chinese ecommerce sites such as Taobao.  Look back at the day in our live blog as Donald Trump arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention following attempted assassination. The FBI continues to investigate the shooting, which occurred prior to the Republican Party's National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As Mr Trump called on his countrymen to \"stand united\" and \"show our true character as Americans\", world leaders sent well wishes and condemned political violence. In an opinion piece published on Monday, Mr Albanese said he was relieved Mr Trump was safe and wrote that: \"We all need to be on guard against those seeking to use misinformation to create division.\" \"This is a time for unity, for calm and for allowing authorities in the US to do their jobs. And it is a moment to reflect on the responsibility we have to maintain our harmony here at home.\" The FBI have named Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Pennsylvania, as the \"subject involved\" in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Earlier, in a social media post soon after the incident, Mr Albanese called the shooting \"concerning and confronting\".  \"There is no place for violence in the democratic process,\" Mr Albanese posted on X. \"I am relieved to hear reports that former president Trump is now safe.\" Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote on X he was appalled by the scenes at the rally, while Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"sickened\" by the shooting. In Japan, where former prime minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated in 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: \"We must stand firm against any form of violence that challenges democracy.

Look back through our blog to see how the day's events unfolded.   By Tessa Flemming  This is where we'll leave our live coverage of the aftermath of an assassination attempt against former US president Donald Trump. A quick recap:  Joe Biden has given an Oval Office address to the nation, appealing for unity. The man killed at the Butler rally was identified as Corey Comperatore, 50. Former US first lady Melania Trump released a statement, calling the shooter a \"monster\". Trump arrived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the Republican National Convention. Trump gives his first interview post shooting, saying that turning his head likely saved his life. You can look back at all of the developments below, or download the ABC News appandsubscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Tessa Flemming  One video shows the shooter — revealed by the FBI to be 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks — crawling across the roof next to the fairground car park. The eyewitness video shows Crooks lying on his side 111 seconds before he shoots Trump. The actual shooting isn't shown, but ABC News Verify has matched the audio in the video of the former president speaking against live feeds of the rally to determine the timing. As the shooter begins to move, a man tries to grab the attention of an off-screen police officer before a woman is heard yelling \"he's on the roof!\". Read more from the ABC News Verify team below:  By Tessa Flemming  John Hart, US government and politics specialist at Australian National University, says he's been \"surprised\" how little air time firearm regulation was getting in the wake of the  shooting. \"(There's been) very, very little discussion about arms control,\" he tells ABC's Afternoon Briefing. \"And it seems to me that the explanation behind this event, at the moment, is guns. \"Until something is done about regulating firearms in the United States, the possibility is that this will occur again and again and again.\" Mr Hart posits a lack of hope for genuine gun control could be behind the lack in coverage. And as for whether the event will change Trump's stance on gun control, Mr Hart's answer is unequivocal. \"You're not going to get Donald Trump on the Republican convention talking about gun control.\" Watch the full interview below:  By Tessa Flemming   Australian leaders, including Anthony Albanese, have expressed their condolences and reiterated the need for calm amid the US shooting. \"I think the problem with some of the events is that they can almost be normalized,\" Mr Albanese told ABC Melbourne Radio. Liberal Senator James Paterson also hoped to avoid similar political division in Australia, but noted \"troubling signs that there are trends towards violent means being used.\" Watch more here:  By Tessa Flemming  Rico Elmore had spoken at the rally in Pennsylvania before Donald Trump took the stage. When the former president was shot at in an assassination attempt, he was seated metres away. \"If you ever watched a scary movie and those blood curdling screams, that's what you heard,\" Mr Elmore told 7.30. He then tried to help save the life of 50-year-old volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore, who had been hit with one of the bullets. It would be in vain. \"Adrenaline kicked in and that's when I turned around and I heard a lady call for a medic,\" Mr Elmore, a member of the Air National Guard, said. \"I jumped over the barrier, the barricade, and ran up into the bleachers.\" \"Around him were many, many people. So I got there … and there was a towel that somebody had … I held the towel against the victim's head. And another gentleman, I believe it was a doctor, tried to provide CPR.\" Watch the full interview tonight on 7.30, on ABC iview. By Elissa Steedman About 2,400 delegates from each US state will officially nominate the Republican Party's official presidential candidate. It's considered a formality because the former president has been the party's presumptive nominee since March, when he amassed the required 1,125 delegates. According to the Associated Press, Trump has been awarded 2,268 delegates total. Trump is expected to officially accept the nomination on Thursday night, local time.  The Republican Party will also adopt a new platform at the convention. The Washington Post has reported the platform will remove opposition to same-sex marriage and drop calls for a national ban on abortion, instead saying such policies should be left up to each state. By Tessa Flemming  Sara Meger, senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Melbourne, says the growing distrust of mainstream media has fuelled misinformation. \"Almost immediately, we saw social media flooding with different narratives of disbelief, of whether or not this was an inside job or some kind of plant or patsy, or even some sort of staged affair,\" she tells ABC News Channel. \"This political polarisation that has led to deep mistrust amongst people over what they get from mainstream media sources, from politicians, and what they call the establishment. \"And it's happening on both sides.\" Watch the full interview here:  By Elissa Steedman So far, Trump has indicated he will keep his schedule as originally planned. That means his next public appearance should be Tuesday, local time at the Republican National Convention.  Here's what he wrote on Truth Social: \"Based on yesterday's terrible events, I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter', or a potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.\" The former president isn't scheduled to speak until Thursday, though. The former president told conservative news outlet The Washington Examiner his speech will be \"a lot different\" to what it would have been two days ago.  He is expected to announce his running mate at the convention. By Tessa Flemming  A Pennsylvania firestation has paid tribute to fallen colleague Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the audience of Trump's rally. \"He was a great man that deserves honour and respect,\" fellow firefighter Craig Cirrincione tells Reuters. \"He wouldn't want us to sit here and be sad. He would hate it. \"He wouldn't want to be thought of as a hero but that's definitely how he should be remembered.\" By Tessa Flemming  While world leaders expressed sympathy for Trump, merchandise sellers ran to promote products emblazoned with pictures of the attempted assassination. Merchandising websites including Etsy have been flooded by hundreds of products using Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci's photo. For sale is everything from T-shirts to mugs and even dog cardigans featuring the image, sometimes altered to accentuate the blood on Mr Trump's face, accompanied by phrases like \"bulletproof\" and \"fight for America\". Read more from Max Walden below: By Tessa Flemming  Mark Willacy has been covering the conservative masterplan Project 2025 and the possibility of a re-elected Donald Trump for Four Corners. He says Trump will emerge \"lionised\" by this assassination attempt. \"It will galvanise his supporters,\" he tells ABC News Channel. \"They will believe that this was manifest destiny. \"He survived the assassin's bullet. He's meant to be the president. \"And what it means is that they will be emboldened. \"I think that they do believe that they've got momentum towards the White House, which makes the transition into the presidency even more important.\" Willacy adds that conversations about Joe Biden's fitness have quietened down amid the shooting. \"We're hearing reports out of the United States that the Democrats who have been agitating against Biden have thought — well, this is not the time, nor is it the place,\" he says. Watch the full interview below: By Tessa Flemming  The FBI has provided a brief update on their investigation into the shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks. The statement reiterated the agency had not identified a motive for the shooter's actions but was \"working to determine the sequence of events and the shooter's movements prior to the shooting, collecting and reviewing evidence, conducting interviews, and following up on all leads.\" \"We have also obtained the shooter's telephone for examination,\" the statement reads. This is after the agency had searched Crooks home and vehicle for additional evidence. By Tessa Flemming  Here's more from that New York Post interview with Donald Trump. Asked about his why he can be heard saying 'I want to get my shoes' as Secret Service agents rush him off stage, Trump says the agents \"hit me so hard that my shoes fell off\". \"And my shoes are tight,\" he adds.  Trump goes on to say the Secret Service agents did a \"fantastic job\". “They took him out with one shot right between the eyes,” he adds. By Tessa Flemming  In his second 'exclusive' interview of the day, Donald Trump tells the New York Post \"I'm supposed to be dead\". \"The doctor at the hospital said he never saw anything like this, he called it a miracle,\" Trump told the outlet. The New York Post described the former president as wearing a loose bandage that covered his right ear. It says Trump's staff insisted that no photos be taken. Trump also used the interview to discuss his decision to raise his fist following the shot. \"A lot of people say it's the most iconic photo they've ever seen,\" Trump said. \"They're right and I didn't die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture.\" He added,\"I just wanted to keep speaking, but I just got shot.\" By Tessa Flemming  ABC News Verify's Kevin Nguyen takes us through how his team were able to confirm video which shows Thomas Matthew Crooks accessing the roof where he shot Trump from. It took just 114 seconds for Crooks to access the roof, get into position and fire three shots at the former president, Nguyen says. Watch the full breakdown here:  By Tessa Flemming  Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi has denied an allegation that the agency diverted resources from Trump's rally. \"We did not divert resources from FPOTUS Trump & protection models don't work that way,\" he said on social media platform X. \"As far as 'field office teams' these are the candidate nominee operations teams that are added during election years for the heavy travel tempo.\" By Tessa Flemming  By Tessa Flemming  Thomas Matthew Crooks was a member of a local shooting club named Clairton Sportsmen's Club, the club confirmed to the media on Sunday while condemning the shooting. \"Obviously, the Club fully admonishes the senseless act of violence that occurred yesterday,\" Attorney Robert Bootay said in a statement to CNN. Bruce Piendl, owner of Allegheny Arms and Gunworks in Bethel Park, said guns were a part of the culture in the area. \"You have to understand in western Pennsylvania we have a rich tradition of hunting and fishing and outdoor stuff,\" he told Reuters. \"Within 10 miles [16 kilometres] of here, there are a tonne of gun clubs.\" Mr Piendl said his records showed he did not sell any firearms to the shooter but he declined to say whether he sold any to his family. \"That's between me and God,\" Mr Piendl said. Reporting with Reuters  By Tessa Flemming  NBC and BBC are reporting that the Biden team will resume its election campaign following the president's interview with NBC News on Tuesday. A Biden campaign official told the outlet that \"both the DNC and the campaign will continue drawing the contrast between our positive vision for the future and Trump and Republicans' backwards-looking agenda over the course of the week.\" By Tessa Flemming  US Vice-President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff have extended their \"deepest condolences\" to shooting victim Corey Comperatore's family. \"He was a husband, father, and firefighter who was shielding his family from gunfire,\" Ms Harris wrote on social media platform X. \"Our hearts break for this loss from yesterday's abhorrent violence.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Prior to the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, multiple US presidents and presidential candidates have been the target of political violence. Four past US presidents were killed while in office, while attempts were made on the lives of two others. Political scientist Richard Herr said the level of violence feels \"reminiscent\" of the deep divisions in the US during the 1960s. The attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania has shocked the world, but United States presidents are no strangers to attempts on their lives. While the last attempt on an American president was more than 40 years ago, the country's political history is littered with assassination attempts, some of them successful, all of them involving guns. Look back at the day in our live blog as Donald Trump arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention following attempted assassination. Death threats unfortunately appear to be par for the course when it comes to the presidency but the last holder with a known attempt on their life was Ronald Reagan. It was March 1981, mere months after he was first elected to the White House; the Republican was leaving a speaking engagement in Washington when a lone gunman fired on him. A bullet hit him under the left arm. Police and Secret Service agents reacting during the assassination attempt on US president Ronald Reagan outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC, on March 30, 1981. (AFP) \"But the motivation was not political,\" explained ANUI International Relations professor Wesley Widmaier. \"The Reagan shooter, he was a mentally disturbed individual who had seen the movie Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster. \"He was obsessed with Jodie Foster and there was a shooting of a political candidate in the movie. So he thought he'd emulate the move. \"It had nothing to do with the kind of partisan agenda of Reagan or anyone like that.\" Reagan was taken to hospital and less than two weeks later was able to return to the White House, but the incident \"really weakened him\". \"It had a much greater effect than people realised at the time on Reagan as a person,\" Professor Widmaier said. \"To the point where he was never really the same afterwards in terms of his rigour and his energy.\" Reagan would serve as president until 1989. Political scientist Richard Herr remembers waking up at 2am one day in 1968 and wondering why they were showing footage of President John F Kennedy's assassination. \"I was asleep in Nebraska, two in the morning. I woke up feeling something was awful and turned on the news, and I thought, 'Why are they replaying Kennedy's assassination?'\" The US National Archives releases thousands of documents related to the 1963 assassination of then-President John F Kennedy. The 35th president, who was the youngest man elected to the office, had been killed five years earlier on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. But this footage was not of John F Kennedy. \"It was his brother Bobby, that was shot in California,\" Dr Herr remembered. Robert F Kennedy, a US senator, was campaigning for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in June 1968 when he was assassinated. \"If Bobby Kennedy hadn't been shot, and he ran and won the Democratic nomination, he could have been president in 1968 and history would have gone in an entirely different direction,\" Professor Widmaier said. Four years later, in 1972, an attempt would be made on the life of another Democratic presidential hopeful, George C Wallace. Wallace, a staunch believer in segregation, survived but would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He would never be the same again. \"Interestingly, if we look at Wallace and Trump, because both of them have [promoted] violence — the use of axe handles to stop segregationists in the 60s and Trump's comments like, 'Don't be too careful when you arrest protesters,' and 'You know what I'd like to do with him.' Wallace actually changed after the assassination attempt in 72 that left him in a wheelchair. \"He said he was a born-again Christian, and he regretted his segregationist policies. \"Whether [the Pennsylvania shooting] will encourage Trump to dial down his level of violent [rhetoric] we'll have to wait and see.\" Dr Herr said the level of violence and division in the US at the moment felt like being back in the 60s all over again. \"The social division, the profound division within America now, over the last eight years is very reminiscent of the kind of deep divisions of the US in the 1960s,\" Dr Herr said. Professor Widmaier agreed it felt like America was heading back to the 60s. \"Everyone talks about the 60s as kind of shorthand for this political upheaval and assassinations and political violence, almost entering the mainstream from both sides,\" he said. \"When you get, which I don't think you've had since the 60s, this intensification of political rhetoric … extreme rhetoric leads to extreme beliefs, leads to extreme actions. That's why you see something like today.\" Before the 60s there were numerous attempts on the lives of American presidents, but they were spread out over decades. Puerto Rican nationalists tried to assassinate president Harry Truman in 1950, Franklin Roosevelt was president-elect in 1933 when he was shot at. While in 1912, Teddy Roosevelt was shot and continued speaking. Others have not been so lucky. President William McKinley, who was president from 1897 to 1901, was killed in office; while Republican president James Garfield spent just 200 days in office before being assassinated in 1880. The first and most famous assassination was Republican President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. \"Lincoln is obviously the big one,\" Professor Widmaier said. \"It changes the course of American history.\" The assassination of America's civil war president Abraham Lincoln might be history's most notorious. (Wikipedia Commons: Currier & Ives) Elected into office in 1860, Lincoln made it his mission to end slavery in America but civil war broke out the following year as the southern states resisted. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring forever free slaves within the Confederacy. Two years later, he was fatally shot while attending a play. His successor, southern-based vice-president Andrew Johnson, steered the country down a very different path. \"The vice-president then tried to roll back the reconstruction agenda of Abe Lincoln and helped to bring about the Jim Crow era in southern politics.\" Listen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and Kriol Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections History NSW NT QLD SA TAS US Elections United States VIC WA World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Mr Trump's shooting \"calls on all of us to take a step back\", Mr Biden said. \"We cannot, we must not, go down this road in America. There is no place in America for this kind of violence for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions.

His representatives say he is \"fine\".  Donald Trump raised his fist repeatedly to screams from the crowd after the shooting. (AP: Gene J.

Mr Biden promised a \"thorough and swift\" investigation and asked the public not to \"make assumptions\" about the shooter's motives or affiliations while the authorities delved into his background.  Earlier today, FBI deputy director Paul Abbate said agents had seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the attack at the Trump rally. But Mr Biden said the attack would not have any impact on the presidential election campaign.  He noted that the Republican National Convention was opening in Milwaukee on Monday, local time.  The president will also be returning to the re-election campaign trail after pausing his schedule to manage the immediate response to the shooting. Mr Biden said the nation was founded on a democracy that gave reason and balance a chance to prevail over brute force.  \"American democracy — where arguments are made in good faith.

His family said he died while shielding his daughters from the gunfire at the event in Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon, local time. Two other attendees remain critically injured.  The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot and killed. Mr Trump was shot in the ear and rushed offstage with blood on his face, but his campaign quickly assured the public he was fine. The former president has since used social media to thank wellwishers, saying: \"It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.\" \"We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness,\" Mr Trump wrote. Donald Trump posted to his social media platform. (Truth Social: Donald Trump) FBI investigators are continuing to look into the background of Crooks, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who they have identified as the \"subject involved\". Explosives have been found in Crooks's car, and suspected explosives have been found at his home, multiple US media outlets are reporting, citing law enforcement sources. Authorities said Crooks climbed onto a nearby rooftop and shot at the former president from outside the venue, in Butler, about 50 kilometres north of Pittsburgh. Witnesses later said they tried to warn police of a gunman on the roof. The near assassination of Donald Trump was a seminal moment in US history. Through multiple live streams, map data, and eyewitness videos, here’s how the rally shooting played out over 11 minutes and 9 seconds.  An AR-style rifle, a type of gun commonly used in mass shootings in the US, was recovered from the scene, sources told AP. Voter records show Crooks was a registered Republican. But he had also made a $US15 donation to a Democrat-supporting political action committee in 2021, according to a Federal Election Commission filing. Mr Trump's wife, Melania Trump, described him as a \"monster who recognised my husband as an inhuman political machine\". \"America, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered,\" she said in a statement.  \"But our courage and common sense must ascend and bring us back together as one.\" Donald Trump raised a fist in the air after the assassination attempt.

Donald Trump said he felt the bullet rip through the skin of his ear. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) \"This is a moment where all leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,\" Mr Shapiro told a press conference.  \"All leaders need to take down the temperature and rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists and search for a better, brighter future for this nation.\" In a special address from the White House, US President Joe Biden repeated calls for unity, and said America needs to \"lower the temperature\" in politics.  \"Yesterday's shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania calls on all of us to take a step back, take stock of where we are, how we go forward from here,\" he said. \"Here in America, we need to get out of our silos where we only listen to those with whom we agree. \"Nothing is more important for us now than standing together. We can do this.\" Earlier, Mr Biden said he and Vice-President Kamala Harris had again been briefed by the Homeland Security team.  He said the shooter's motive remained unknown. \"I urge everyone, everyone, please don't make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,\" Mr Biden said. \"Let the FBI do their job, and their partner agencies do their job. \"Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that right now.\" The shooting happened as Republicans from across the country were preparing to gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the party's national convention. The convention, which begins on Monday, local time, will go ahead as planned.  Mr Trump touched down in Milwaukee shortly before 6pm local time (9am Monday AEST) and is scheduled to address the convention on Thursday.  His yet-to-be-named running mate is also due to speak at the convention during the week.

We know that people are mobilising behind their particular ideological take on this. \"It's corrosive to our democracy and to respectful engagement and debate. We know that that was already in short supply prior to this, but it may well only get worse,\" he said.Katherine Keneally, the director of threat analysis and prevention at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, says this is a sad new normal for modern society and social media. \"Conspiracy theories have no longer remained in the fringes of our society, and we are seeing them spread to mainstream individuals and becoming common among society, not just in the US, but around the world,\" she said. \"This is, unfortunately, not a new trend, where people will try and profit off of some horrible events. And this is arguably one of the most horrific events …\" Over the last 24 hours ABC News Verify has observed and analysed some of the popular false claims and conspiracies. While all of these have been roundly debunked by fact checkers, some continue to resurface online in part because they provide ready-made explanations that align with the existing beliefs of some of those looking for answers. A 2022 video advertisement for investment firm BlackRock, filmed at Bethel High school, includes footage of Thomas Crooks, who was then a student. It's become a beacon for conspiracy theorists on social media platforms including X and TikTok. Far-right US influencer and former US congressional candidate Laura Loomer posted a copy of the video advertisement on X on July 14. Her post has so far been viewed 15 million times.Ms Loomer's post has attracted many comments from other X users who say the advertisement is proof BlackRock was behind the assassination attempt. An example of a reply to an X post linking the Donald Trump's shooter with asset management firm BlackRock. (Supplied) A post by cryptocurrency influencer Matt Wallace that has been viewed over 1 million times, uses this grain of truth — that Crooks featured in an advertisement — to claim that BlackRock was involved in the assassination attempt. Mr Wallace, who has 1.8 million followers on X and has seen interaction and praise on his posts from platform owner Elon Musk, has a documented history of spreading falsehoods. He's also one of many people using the assassination attempt to sell unofficial pro-Trump T-shirts, which he says will raise funds for the former president's campaign. The T-shirt cryptocurrency influencer Matt Wallace was selling following Trump's attempted assassination. (Supplied) It's not a surprise to Kate FitzGerald, a conspiracy researcher, PhD student and lead analyst at QUT's Digital Media Research Centre. \"Something that they are also benefiting from is increased engagement. So for example, if they host a podcast or a show, by sharing this merchandise that people are interested in purchasing, they're also going to be driving further traffic to their own websites and their own other offerings,\" she said. Claims that the assassination attempt was staged have flourished on social media with people across the political spectrum focusing on the actions — and alleged inactions — of security personnel. While some intelligence experts have criticised the response of security personnel, many conspiracy theorists on social media have held up apparent failures by security as proof of a plot. An interview with an eyewitness who told BBC News that they alerted authorities to the presence of the gunman has fuelled claims that US security services intentionally allowed the assassination attempt. Others on the left of the political spectrum have used the same witness testimony given to the BBC to claim the shooting was staged by the Trump campaign to boost his chances in the November election on platforms. A BBC interview with a Trump rally bystander has been used to claim the former president's attempted assassination was staged. (Supplied) The fact that opposing political camps can use the very same testimony to support different conspiracy theories is a vivid indicator of how existing prejudices and biased sources can undermine our collective understanding of reality. Beyond alternative interpretations of the BBC clip, multiple social media influencers have openly suggested security personnel were intentionally \"stood down\". Some of these claims originated on fringe far-right websites and have since spread to more mainstream social media platforms like X. This X user created a meme using vision of law enforcement snipers to imply wrongdoing on their part. (Supplied) Another ingredient adding to this sense of collective confusion are conspiracies and falsehoods peddled for attention. In the hours following the shooting posts circulated on Instagram and X from a young man with glasses and long hair claiming to be Crooks. His testimonial and photos of his side profile circulated on multiple social media platforms, but his claims were shot down by fact checkers later that day. The near assassination of Donald Trump was a seminal moment in US history. Through multiple live streams, map data, and eyewitness videos, here's how the rally shooting played out over 11 minutes and 9 seconds. But despite the debunking, those claims and others have continued to spread. Some social media influencers have also chased attention by encouraging false claims about their involvement in the attempt on Trump's life. One of these, a minor influencer who ABC News Verify has chosen not to name, falsely suggested to reporters that they had links to Crooks. That influencer has since published posts mocking those who fell for the falsified connection.\"Unfortunately there are nefarious actors out there that see this as an opportunity to profit by selling merchandise, or by using the social media algorithm to profit or push particular beliefs,\" Ms Keneally said. For reporters and news consumers alike, telling the difference between falsehoods and reality will continue to be difficult, particularly as major players like X and Meta have continued to pull back on transparency measures that enable investigators to dig into misinformation At the same time some fact-checking groups have seen investments dwindle or have shut down. Experts say we can expect more confusion and chaos emerging from major events for those trying to separate fact from fiction. \"As humans, we are all susceptible to these sorts of beliefs,\" ISD's Ms Keneally told ABC News Verify. \"So I'm not surprised, particularly considering that it is the Republican presidential candidate, or nominee, that we are seeing lots of conspiracies from both sides of the aisle.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Crime Topic:Explainer Social Media US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Marco Bello) Florida-based US District Judge Aileen Cannon has dismissed the criminal case accusing Donald Trump of illegally holding onto classified documents. Judge Cannon ruled that Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the prosecution, was unlawfully appointed to his role and did not have the authority to bring the case. The US Justice Department will appeal against the ruling.  A US judge has dismissed the criminal case against Donald Trump that accused him of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving the White House.  Mr Trump was indicted in June last year, and pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges that he kept national security documents when he left office and lied to officials who sought to recover them.     The trial had been scheduled to begin in May, but it was indefinitely postponed by Florida-based US District Judge Aileen Cannon. The US Justice Department announced it will appeal against the ruling, a spokesperson for Special Counsel Jack Smith said.  Today Judge Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Mr Trump in 2020, dismissed the case on the grounds that the prosecution's Special Counsel Jack Smith did not have authority to bring the case.  \"The superseding indictment is dismissed because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the appointments clause of the United States constitution,\" she wrote in her ruling. It is a major legal victory for Mr Trump as he prepares to be officially endorsed as presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention this week.  It follows the US Supreme Court's ruling in July that as a former president, he is broadly immune from prosecution for many of his actions in office. This past week was arguably the worst of Joe Biden's 2024 campaign. And it might have been one of Donald Trump's best. The classified documents case is one of four pending criminal cases against the former president, and the first indictment to be dismissed.  In May this year, he was found guilty of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign, making him the first American president to be convicted of a crime in history.  He is also awaiting trial in two cases of alleged election interference during the 2020 election and leading up to the January 6 insurrection — a federal case and a separate case in the state of Georgia.  Mr Trump has sought to characterise all of the criminal cases against him as \"witch hunts\", and has welcomed the dismissal of the classified documents trial.  In a post on Truth Social, he said it should be \"just the first step\", followed quickly by the dismissals of the remaining cases against him. Mr Trump was indicted on charges that he knowingly held onto documents including sensitive national security information at his Mar-a-Lago estate after leaving the White House, and that he obstructed government efforts to retrieve the material. Under the Presidential Records Act, presidential records are considered federal property and must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at the end of a president's term. According to the indictment handed down in June last year, Mr Trump sent boxes that contained personal letters, notes, photographs and \"hundreds of classified documents\" from the White House to his property in Florida after leaving the White House in 2021.   According to the 49-page indictment released today, Donald Trump sent “scores” of boxes to his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida after leaving the White House.  The classified documents included information on national defence and weapons capabilities, nuclear programs, and potential vulnerabilities of the US and its allies. At Mar-a-Lago, the boxes were stored in various locations including a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, and office space and a storage room.  After months of back-and-forth with Mr Trump's office, the NARA referred the matter of missing documents to the Department of Justice. The FBI opened a criminal investigation in March 2022 and a federal grand jury began an investigation a month later. Investigators would eventually seize 13,000 documents from Mar-a-Lago in a series of searches. Photos from an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago showed boxes of documents spilling their contents onto the floor. (Supplied: Department of Justice via AP) In addition to unlawfully retaining documents, Mr Trump was accused of conspiring with a personal aide, Walt Nauta, to obstruct the Department of Justice investigation.  Mr Nauta and another staffer, Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Olivera, were also charged with conspiring to obstruct justice.  Mr Trump's lawyers had challenged the legal authority for Special Counsel Jack Smith to be appointed as a prosecutor leading investigations into the former president.  Mr Smith was sworn in as a special prosecutor by Attorney-General Merrick Garland in November 2022.  Mr Trump's legal team argued the appointment violated the US constitution because his office was not created by Congress and he was not confirmed by the Senate. Lawyers in Mr Smith's office disputed those claims, arguing there was a well-settled practice of using special counsels to manage politically sensitive investigations. But Judge Cannon's decision today dismissed that argument, ruling that the attorney-general did not have the authority \"to appoint a federal officer with the kind of prosecutorial power wielded by Special Counsel Smith\". Judge Cannon found that US Special Counsel Jack Smith was not authorised to prosecute the case against Mr Trump because his appointment violated the constitution. (Reuters: Kevin Wurm) She also made several references to an opinion of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas within the court's July ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution. In his concurrence, Justice Thomas questioned whether Mr Smith had been legally appointed as special counsel and called on lower court judges to consider.  In a statement, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described Judge Cannon's ruling as \"breathtakingly misguided\", adding that it \"flies in the face of long-accepted practice and repetitive judicial precedence\".  \"It is wrong on the law and must be appealed immediately. This is further evidence that Judge Cannon cannot handle this case impartially and must be reassigned,\" he said. Prosecutors are likely to appeal Judge Cannon's ruling. Courts in other cases have repeatedly upheld the ability of the US Justice Department to appoint special counsels to handle certain politically sensitive investigations. But the dismissal casts serious doubt on the future of the case. Mr Smith is also prosecuting Mr Trump in the federal case over alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, however the former president's legal team has not made a similar challenge to the special counsel in that case. Mr Trump is also due to be sentenced in September over the New York hush money case.

Before Tuesday, Trump had three criminal trials pending.   Two relate to alleged attempts to turn around the election result in 2020. In the third, he was accused of illegally retaining classified documents after he left the White House, and lying to officials who tried to get them back.  But that third case has now been thrown out by Florida Judge Aileen Cannon (who was given the job of judge by Trump himself in 2020).  The case was dismissed on something of a technicality.  Classified documents spilled onto the floor in a storeroom at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. (Reuters: US Justice Department/Handout) Judge Cannon found that the special prosecutor running the case, Jack Smith, was appointed illegally by the Justice Department.  Trump's legal team had argued the appointment violated the US constitution because his office was not created by Congress, and nor was he confirmed by the Senate.  There'd been an expectation this could happen. Conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas recently questioned the legality of Smith's appointment as part of his written opinion in the ruling that found ex-presidents had some immunity from prosecution.  On social media, Trump said the decision \"should be just the first step\" and the other \"witch hunts\" should be thrown out too.  Smith is also the special prosecutor in one of the election interference cases, but that's being heard by a court in Washington DC, where the judge may take a different view of his appointment.  JD Vance served in the US Marine Corps for four years before becoming a senator in Ohio. (AP: Carolyn Kaster) It's Ohio senator JD Vance, a 39-year-old venture capitalist who made his name with a memoir called Hillbilly Elegy (Glenn Close was nominated for an Oscar for the movie version).  Announcing his choice on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote:  \"JD has had a very successful business career in technology and finance, and now, during the campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.\"  Vance is a committed conservative, but he hasn't always been a Trump fan.  \"I'm a never Trump guy,\" he said during the publicity tour for his book, back when Trump first ran in 2016.  Delegates celebrated Senator JD Vance's nomination from the convention floor.  (AP:  Nam Y. Huh) In a leaked Facebook message to a friend, he asked whether Trump would be \"America's Hitler\".  But, like many of Trump's former foes in the GOP, Vance has come around. He recently told the New York Times:  \"Like a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration.\"  He told Fox News Trump only offered him the VP job on Tuesday:  \"He just said, 'Look, I think [we're] going to go save this country. I think you're the guy who can help me in the best way.\"  Trump and Vance are now both officially the party's candidates for the November 5 election.  As part of his publicity blitz to counter perceptions he's too old to govern, Joe Biden did a sit-down interview with NBC News in which he admitted it was a mistake to use the term \"bullseye\" in relation to Donald Trump. Since the assassination attempt on Trump at the weekend, Biden's received criticism for the comments he made while on a private phone call with donors the previous week. According to Politico, the president said: \"We're done talking about the debate. It's time to put Trump in a bullseye.\"  During the NBC interview, he said: \"It was a mistake to use the word. I didn't say crosshairs. I meant bullseye, I meant focus on him. Focus on what he's doing. Focus on his policies. Focus on the number of lies he told in the debate.\" Donald Trump phoned JD Vance earlier that day to offer him the vice-president nomination. (AP: Julia Nikhinson) Trump said he had considered delaying his trip to the convention after Saturday's shooting, but he'd decided he couldn't let a potential assassin force a scheduling change.  He flew into Milwaukee before the convention, but he wasn't necessarily expected to make an appearance on day one.  However, late in the evening, he walked into the arena, with a bandage on the ear that was grazed by the bullet.  He was greeted with chants of \"fight\" – a reference to the word he mouthed as he was helped to his feet by his security detail, with blood on his face and a fist in the air, after the assassination attempt.  On stage through the day and evening, there'd been quite a few mentions of miracles and thanks offered to God for sparing Trump's life.   Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Analysis by Ian Verrender Topic:World Politics Foreign Affairs Government and Politics US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Getty Images: Alex Wong, Four Corners: Nick Wiggins) He survived an assassination attempt. He's as defiant and determined as ever. And if Donald Trump is returned to power by American voters this November he'll have an \"army\" at his disposal — at least 10,000 people, recruited to help implement his controversial agenda. The director of a network of conservative groups, Paul Dans, has told Four Corners his organisation Project 2025 has prepared a detailed \"battle plan\" and has the people trained and ready to execute it. It would see the president's power expanded like never before and allow him to target the so-called \"deep state\" — in Trump's telling, the ruling class of faceless civil servants that thwarted his first term agenda. But opponents warn Project 2025 will put political stooges in key decision-making positions, empower the former president to prosecute his political enemies, and set the United States on a path to authoritarianism. Project 2025's master plan begins with stacking the civil service in the president's favour. \"We have a database with over 10,000 people from all walks of life entering into this, aspiring to serve,\" Dans says, in an exclusive television interview. \"We want people who've been cancelled, who've figuratively given blood for the movement. These are mums who've challenged school boards. These are people who've stood up in their companies and said, 'Enough with [diversity, equity and inclusion] and the woke agenda.'\" These potential administration recruits will be vetted to ensure they align with the Trump agenda. Project 2025 reviews budding applicants' social media accounts and probes their political philosophy, asking whether they agree or disagree with statements such as: \"It's making sure that we have the right people who are going to be steeped in the battle plan,\" says Dans, who served as chief of staff in the Office of Personnel Management in the Trump administration. \"We want the person who keeps getting knocked down and is indefatigable. I actually think of Aussies a lot like that. They're always popping up to the top and they have this kind of shit-eating grin on their face. That is the kind of happy warrior that we want.\" Under Project 2025's plan, the president would appoint these \"happy warriors\" to senior positions in bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Trade Commission. They claim Trump's first term agenda was frustrated by unelected officials, and want to ensure this time is different. \"Our goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained, and prepared conservatives to go to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State.\" 'Mandate for Leadership', Project 2025 \"What will be left will be the grifters and the sycophants,\" former Republican congressman Charlie Dent says. \"Whatever [Trump's] worst impulse is of the day, they will facilitate it and will enable it. \"They want people who are unswervingly loyal to the Trump agenda, to his vision and to him as a person, as well as to his and the movement's goal of subordinating those who don't look or sound like them,\" says former Department of Justice lawyer, Erica Newland, who now works with the Washington-based anti-authoritarian group Protect Democracy. \"What Donald Trump wants are political stooges who will be loyal not to the office of the president, but to the person of the president and whatever his dreams or whims are.\" During his first administration, Trump tried to replace the chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture with his 2016 presidential campaign co-chair. His proposed USDA chief scientist had no science background and had gained prominence as a right-wing talk show host. Project 2025's plan for the next Trump administration is laid out in a 920-page transition and policy manifesto: \"This book, this agenda, the entire Project 2025 is a plan to unite the conservative movement and the American people against elite rule and woke culture warriors.\" 'Mandate for Leadership', Project 2025 Project 2025 is a grouping of more than 100 leading US conservative organisations, including the Heritage Foundation, a think tank that has produced policy plans for prospective Republican administrations since 1981. The organisation includes many senior officials like Dans who worked in Trump's first administration and who remain close to the former president. It is not officially tied to the Trump campaign, and in recent weeks the former president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025. \"Some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them,\" Trump posted on social media. It came after the Democrats launched a campaign warning that Project 2025 presented a threat to American democracy. But Dans confirmed his team has ongoing connections with the Trump campaign. \"We have integration with folks on the campaign. The reality is … we often supply ideas and ultimately we hope to offer personnel suggestions,\" Dans says. \"This is really going to be the engine room for the next administration. Many of these folks served and will be called upon to serve again.\" Project 2025's manifesto is based on several pillars, including to 'restore the family as the centrepiece of American life'. They believe this will be achieved by removing all gender identity terms from legislation and federal rules, pursuing anti-abortion policies at every level of government, and banning transgender people from the military. The document also supports opening up \"America's vast reserves of oil and natural gas\" as \"they are the lifeblood of economic growth\". But the central principle of much of the plan is that a democratically elected president is the American people's proxy – that it's the job of the thousands of unelected civil servants to carry out Trump's orders, without question. \"The great challenge confronting a conservative President is the … boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will …\" 'Mandate for Leadership', Project 2025 Critics, including moderate Republicans, warn Trump will be empowered to do whatever he wants. \"I'm afraid if Trump were to win in 2024, those types of people who would try to put some checks and restrain the worst impulses of the president won't be there,\" Charlie Dent says. \"It's a prescription for chaos in our democracy because, frankly, the burden of governing in our country rests with public servants who … swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend that Constitution,\" says former US Defense Secretary and CIA chief Leon Panetta. \"To take a position that you want to get rid of civil servants … and to basically put in individuals that are part of kind of his organised effort to turn our democracy upside down, it's a frightening prospect.\" Dans says it will be a \"beacon of democracy\". \"I think we're building a city on a hill. \"This is one [of] the greatest experiments in human history for advancing bounty and freedom across the globe.\" The agency at the top of Trump's deep state hit list is the powerful Department of Justice (DOJ). \"We will completely overhaul the corrupt Department of Injustice to clear out all the communists who have weaponised government activities,\" Trump said in a speech in February. The DOJ has investigated the former president over allegations he interfered in the 2020 election, and that he illegally kept classified documents at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida. Trump has been criminally charged in both cases. For Trump loyalists such as former presidential assistant Sebastian Gorka this reinforced their belief the department had been captured by the \"deep state\". \"Of all of these agencies and departments, the DOJ is the worst,\" Gorka says. \"The DOJ is a viper's nest of politically motivated individuals who see it as their fiefdom to serve the Democrat party and their buddies.\" Despite accusing the Justice Department of being politicised, Trump has promised to tear down any independence the DOJ enjoys and to use the agency as an instrument of his will. Speaking at his New Jersey golf club last year, the former president vowed to appoint a special prosecutor \"to go after the most corrupt president in the history of America, Joe Biden, and go after the Biden crime family.\" \"I certainly expect there could be political show trials under Donald Trump,\" says Erica Newland. \"There is nothing he loves more than a reality TV show-style assertion of power. \"The question is whether our institutions, those attorneys at the Department of Justice, and our judges will be strong enough to prevent that from happening.\" Trump has accused many senior officials, including the then chief of the military and reportedly his former National Security Advisor, of treason. Under the US Constitution, a person found guilty of treason can be put to death. That former National Security Advisor, John Bolton, believes a second term would be a \"retribution presidency\". \"I mean, he tried to put me in jail for the book that I published,\" Bolton says. \"He doesn't forget his grudges. And I think the only consolation I have is that I'm part of a very long list. \"I think he's very serious when he says he wants to go after 'enemies' as he describes them … basically people he's had personal disputes with, not enemies of the United States.\" Newland is taking seriously Trump's threats to pursue those he perceives as political enemies. \"This is really, really terrifying because the Department of Justice holds what I think of as the most awesome domestic power that the US government has.\" Temidayo Aganga-Williams believes Trump will do what he says. Williams was senior investigative counsel on the US House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. \"I think he currently is an existential threat. He's a former president who led an armed rebellion against his own country … the question is whether the American people are going to put him in a position of power again to finish the job.\" The committee's investigation found the \"central cause of January 6 was one man, former president Donald Trump, whom many others followed\". \"None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.\" Last year, the former president joked in an interview that if he won re-election he would be a dictator, but only on his first day in office. His critics did not see the funny side. \"One of the things I learned serving on the January 6th committee is to take Trump at his word, because he does mean to do what he says,\" Veteran Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren says. \"He said that he intends to terminate parts of the constitution. He didn't say which parts. But you can't do that constitutionally. There's no procedure for the president to obviate the constitution.\" Erica Newland views Donald Trump as \"an authoritarian threat to this country\". \"There's a playbook that authoritarians use: they aggrandise executive authority. They politicise independent institutions. They quash dissent. They spread misinformation. They target vulnerable communities. They corrupt elections, and they stoke violence. Donald Trump has engaged in all seven of these.\" But Project 2025 director Paul Dans says Trump will save America from dictatorship. \"We're living under kind of a tyrannical reign of Joe Biden,\" Dans says, citing FBI surveillance, \"free speech police\", and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. \"That is tyranny … we're in the midst of a neo-Marxist revolution here in the United States, and we have to wake up to what's going on. \"At some point we have to … get to the ramparts and help this country.\" Lofgren says the stakes of a second Trump presidency are very high. \"I'm not sure the country will survive it, honestly,\" Lofgren says. \"If he really does intend to do the things that he says, we would not have the kind of democratic republic that we've enjoyed for over 200 years.\" Others share her fears. \"If he's returned to the presidency, he's gonna be dangerous,\" Leon Panetta says.  \"It can literally destroy our democracy.\" Watch Retribution – The battle for Democracy, the first of a special two-part Four Corners series, now on ABC iview.

Mr Trump will formally accept the party's nomination as its presidential candidate in a prime-time address later today. Donald Trump has been officially nominated as the Republican presidential candidate for the 2024 election, and selected Ohio senator JD Vance as his running mate.  It kicks off the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to formally nominate the party's presidential ticket. In an announcement on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump said he had given the decision \"lengthy deliberation and thought, considering the tremendous talents of many others\".  \"As vice-president, JD will continue to fight for our constitution, stand with our troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\" he wrote. Follow live for all the latest news and updates from the Republican National Convention. Shortly after Mr Trump's announcement, the Republican party confirmed the selection on stage at the convention.  After making his way slowly through a crowd of cheering supporters gathered at the Fiserv Forum, Mr Vance was formally nominated by Republican delegates. He beamed from in front of the stage alongside his wife Usha Vance, to raucous applause and chants of \"JD! JD! JD!\"  JD Vance arrived at the Republican National Convention to raucous applause.  (Reuters: Mike Segar) Mr Vance did not take the stage today but is expected to address the convention later in the week.  In an interview on Fox News, Senator Vance confirmed that he was only asked to be Mr Trump's running mate today.  \"He just said: 'Look, I think [we're] going to go save this country. I think you're the guy who can help me in the best way. You can help me govern, you can help me win',\" he said.  It comes just two days after Mr Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, and hours after he secured a major legal victory when a federal judge dismissed the classified documents case against him. \"It's amazing, frankly, that he wasn't hurt much, much worse,\" Senator Vance said in his interview with Sean Hannity for Fox News. \"I think there needs to be a full-scale investigation. We need to understand what happened because clearly, mistakes were made.\" Mr Trump is due to formally accept the party's nomination in a prime-time address later today. He has foreshadowed a speech that focuses more on national unity than highlighting differences with President Joe Biden. \"This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would've been two days ago,\" Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner. A staunch conservative from a Republican state, James David Vance rose to prominence as a venture capitalist and bestselling author of Hillbilly Elegy before making the move into politics.  His memoir about growing up in a working-class family in rural Ohio, which was released in 2016, has been described as a powerful insight into the political shifts that saw Mr Trump rise to power. In the past Mr Vance has been a vocal critic of the former president, describing him in 2016 as \"an idiot\", a \"cynical asshole\" and \"America's Hitler\". However, in the years since he has become one of Mr Trump's strongest supporters.  During Mr Trump's time in office, Mr Vance said he came to support his policies — and in 2022 he secured the former president's endorsement when he ran for a seat in the US Senate.  \"I wasn’t always nice, but the simple fact is, he's the best president of my lifetime, and he revealed the corruption in this country like nobody else,\" he said at a rally ahead of the 2022 midterms.  Since being elected to the Senate, Mr Vance has been a strong defender of the Make America Great Again agenda, particularly on trade, foreign policy and immigration.  Describing himself as a pro-life Christian, Mr Vance has voiced support for banning abortion beyond 15 weeks, and for measures that incentivise families to have children. Mr Vance has openly challenged the legitimacy of criminal prosecutions against Mr Trump, and remains a proponent of false claims that the 2020 election was \"stolen\".  In February this year, he told news outlets that if he had been vice-president on January 6, he would have told states where Mr Trump disputed the results \"that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there\".  Donald Trump has chosen one of his most staunch defenders as his running mate.  (Reuters: Gaelen Morse) He is seen as a candidate who could increase voter turnout among the former president's loyal voting base. Some of Mr Trump's supporters had been pushing him to select a woman or person of colour as his running mate in a bid to expand support beyond white male voters.  Donald Trump has refused to let an assassination attempt keep him from his party's major pre-election get-together, which will champion his vision for a changed America. Here's what to expect. In the wake of this week's shooting in Pennsylvania, Mr Vance suggested Joe Biden was to blame for the violence.  \"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that president Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\" he wrote on X.  \"That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.\" The suggestion was roundly criticised by Democrats. Police have not yet specified a motivation for the shooting.  Asked about his opponent's choice of running mate, Mr Biden said the Ohio senator was a \"clone of Trump on the issues\". \"Donald Trump picked JD Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn't do on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,\" he wrote in an earlier statement. Delegates were quick to add JD Vance's name to their signs on day one of the Republican National Convention. \n\n  (AP: Matt Rourke) ABC/wires Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Crime Topic:Explainer Elections Political Parties and Movements US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Look back through our blog to see how the day's events unfolded.   By Elissa Steedman This is where we'll leave our live coverage of the first day of the Republican National Convention. Here's a quick recap: You can look back at all of the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Elissa Steedman Billionaire Elon Musk plans to commit about $US45 million ($67 million) a month to a pro-Trump political-action committee, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. A political action committee (PAC) is an organisation that collects donations from members and directs them toward political campaigns. Musk indicated he planned to start his donations to the America PAC in July, the newspaper said. But the South Africa-born businessman was not listed on a Monday filing by the group showing it had raised more than $8 million. Musk did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Musk publicly endorsed Trump for the first time in the US presidential race on Saturday, hours after the former president was shot in the ear during a campaign rally. Reporting with Reuters By Elissa Steedman A Florida judge has dismissed the criminal case accusing Donald Trump of illegally holding onto classified documents, dealing the former president another major legal victory. The ABC's Michael Rowland spoke on the matter from Washington, DC earlier. \"A Florida judge, who needs to be known is a Trump appointee, sensationally threw out one of the criminal cases against him, earlier today, our time,\" Rowland said. Watch the video here:  By Jessica Riga American journalist and academic Bill Wyman says it's \"such an interesting pick\" for Trump to select JD Vance as his running mate. \"There's a tradition of getting a younger person who will be your attack dog,\" Wyman says, saying Vance solidly fits into that role. \"He's obviously a very, excuse the expression, unhinged sort of guy. He won't stop anything.\" Wyman continues, saying: \"He doesn't seem to have a whole lot of intellectual principles when it comes to facts or consistency. I think you're going to see him really going on the attack. \"The thing that's unusual is they are so closely aligned politically. Generally you want a vice-president who expands your political base, appeals to a different demographic. \"Vance is none of these.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania  Walking around the arena where the convention is taking place, it's clear a lot of the travelling delegates packed their Republican fashion statements. Red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball caps, Trump mugshot T-shirts and stars-and-stripes everything are very much on trend here. But for those who have left some space in their luggage, there's a variety of MAGA merch on sale. One of the guys selling these products told me the \"I'm voting for the felon\" T-shirt had been the most popular purchase so far. By Elissa Steedman Official proceedings for the first day of the Republican National Convention have finished. RNC chair Michael Whatley just declared the convention will now stand at recess until tomorrow. Don't Stop Believin' by Journey is playing through the main auditorium as Trump makes his exit.  It's currently 10pm in Milwaukee. By Jessica Riga Earlier today, Joe Biden was interviewed by NBC News anchor Lester Holt. He was asked about a phrase he used the week before the attempted assassination of the former president, with Biden saying it was \"time to put Trump in the bullseye\". Biden said it was a mistake to use that phrase, but clarified that he didn't say \"crosshairs\" and that he meant bullseye in the sense of \"focusing\" on Trump's agenda. By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga This marks Donald Trump's first public appearance since his attempted assassination on the weekend. You can see he has a bandage covering most of his right ear. He gets a standing ovation from the crowd before they break into a chorus of \"USA, USA, USA\". God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood is playing in the background. It's a song on high rotation in the campaign playlist. By Michael Rowland US President Joe Biden and Donald Trump's freshly nominated running mate JD Vance have sat down for two vastly different TV interviews. Biden was at times defiant and defensive in a hard-hitting interview at the White House with NBC News anchor Lester Holt. The president accused Trump of inflaming political tensions in the lead-up to the assassination attempt, but Biden got snippy when Holt raised his dismal debate performance and those persistent questions about whether he should stay in the race. In contrast, a smiling JD Vance cruised through a sympathetic chat at the Republican National Convention with Sean Hannity on Fox News. There were lots of softball questions and Vance was rarely challenged, all while viewers got to see a split screen of jubilant Republicans in the convention hall. The contrasting images were stark and reinforced how the Republicans are at the moment very much in the political ascendancy. The challenge for Biden is to try and regain political momentum. It won't be easy. And the clock is ticking. By Elissa Steedman  Trump has made an appearance at the convention in Milwaukee. A bandage is covering the ear that was pierced by a bullet in the assassination attempt at his Pennsylvania rally.  His entrance was met with a standing ovation from the audience. Trump joined his running mate JD Vance and family in the VIP stands. By Elissa Steedman Hannity has asked Vance to  clarify his position on abortion policy. \"First of all, the Democrats have completely twisted my words,\" the vice-presidential candidate said. \"What I did say is that we sometimes in this society see babies as inconveniences, and I absolutely want us to change that.\"  Vance backed the Republican Party policy of letting states set their own laws on the issue. \"California is going to want to have a different policy from Ohio, Ohio is going to have a different policy from Alabama, and it is reasonable to let voters in states make those decisions. \"Doesn't mean we have to agree with it, but you have to have some respect for the political process.\" Reuters reported earlier today his position on abortion appeared to have converged with Trump's:  \"Vance implied in a 2021 interview that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term, and in November he described a vote by Ohioans to add the right to abortion care to the state's constitution as a \"gut punch\". \"This year, he said he supports access to the abortion pill mifepristone, a view that Trump shares.\" By Elissa Steedman Vance has used his Fox News interview to spruik Trump's international relations plan. \"What President Trump has promised to do is go in there, negotiate with the Russians and Ukrainians, bring this thing to a rapid close so that America can focus on the real issue, which is China. \"That's the biggest threat to our country and we're completely distracted from it.\" By Jessica Riga During the NBC News interview Biden said he was \"not surprised\" by the dismissal of a case involving Trump's handling of classified documents, but said he found it \"specious\". \"I find it specious because I don't agree with Clarence Thomas,\" Biden said referring to the Supreme Court justice. By Elissa Steedman Vance says he only learned of Trump's running mate choice today. \"He just said, 'Look, I think [we're] going to go save this country. I think you're the guy who can help me in the best way.  You can help me govern, you can help me win. You can help me in some of these Midwestern states, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth.'\" He said the former president also asked to speak with his seven-year-old son, who had been making noise in the background of the call. \"You think about this. Everything that's happened — the guy just got shot at a couple of days ago — and he takes the time to talk to my seven-year-old. \"It's a moment I'll never forget.\" By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke President Biden was asked pointedly whether former president Barack Obama or former first lady Michelle Obama should be doing more to express public confidence in him. \"They're helping me. They've helped me from the beginning,\" the president said. But he said: \"This is my job to get this done\". Importantly, he said he hadn't spoken to Obama for a couple of weeks, which would mean they haven't spoken since the debate performance (Biden seemed slightly confused about this timeline though). There has been reporting in US media that former president Obama has been expressing concern about Biden's ability to compete with Trump since his concerning debate performance. According to a recent poll, Michelle Obama is the best-placed fantasy candidate to take on Donald Trump. She's previously indicated she doesn't want the job though. By Elissa Steedman Vance has called for a full-scale investigation into the assassination attempt on Trump. \"It's amazing, frankly, that he wasn't hurt much, much worse,\" he said in his interview with Sean Hannity for Fox News. \"I think there needs to be a full-scale investigation. \"We need to understand what happened because clearly, mistakes were made.\" By Jessica Riga Biden seemed to not enjoy the use of the word \"episode\". Lester Holt expanded on the question to say \"a performance on that level\". \"I don't plan to have another performance on that level,\" Biden said. And that was the final question of the interview. Lester Holt says NBC News extended the same interview offer to Donald Trump. By Jessica Riga \"I've been doing this a long time. The idea that I'm the old guy, I am, but I'm only three older than Trump,\" Biden says. \"I've gotten more done than any president in a long time.\" Biden adds that he gets why people ask about age, saying: \"It's a legitimate question to ask.\" By Jessica Riga Joe Biden was asked a week or two ago in another interview if he had seen the debate and, at the time, he said: \"I think so.\" Lester Holt asks again if Biden has seen the debate. \"I've seen pieces of it, I have not seen the whole debate,\" Biden says.

As the former president rose to power in 2016, Vance was a vocal never-Trumper. It was around the time he was releasing his best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, a raw insight into growing up poor in rural Ohio. Follow live: Latest updates from second day of the Republican National Convention Fast-forward eight years and the now 39-year-old first-term senator has transformed himself into one of Trump's staunchest backers, hand-picked by him to run on his presidential ticket. So, how did JD Vance win over Donald Trump, a man known for holding bitter grudges? On the face of it, the retired marine, Yale-educated lawyer and venture capitalist is the perfect partner for Trump and will likely help him pick up votes in battleground Midwestern rust belt states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. In his memoir, which gained him currency with the conservative media and a national profile, he recounts the honest truth of what it was like growing up in a steelmaking town. The childhood home where Vance grew up in Middletown, Ohio.   (The Enquirer/USA Today Network: Sam Greene, via Reuters) \"I want people to understand what happens in the lives of the poor and the psychological impact that spiritual and material poverty has on their children,\" he wrote in the book's introduction. \"I want people to understand the American dream as my family and I encountered it. I want people to understand how upward mobility really feels. And I want people to understand something I learned only recently: that for those of us lucky enough to live the American dream, the demons of the life we left behind continue to chase us.\" Born to a mother who struggled with drug addiction and a father who left the family when he was just a toddler, JD Vance was raised by his grandparents. Based on the life of JD Vance, Hillbilly Elegy tells the story of a boy from the rural Appalachia region of the US \"making it\" despite a rough upbringing. Here is your shortcut guide to the film. His book took a conservative view, describing his family and friends as welfare dependents who failed to dig themselves out of the poverty that beset them. Painting himself as the counterpoint to the societal failures that surrounded him, he pulled himself up by his bootstraps, as they say, to achieve the American dream in the face of adversity. He is practically the embodiment of the political movement that swept Trump to office in the first place. After four years in the US Marines, serving in Iraq as a combat correspondent, Vance returned to Ohio State University and Yale Law School before securing a job as a venture capitalist in California. In 2017, he returned to Ohio with his wife Usha Vance to raise their three children. He then decided to launch his career in politics, but there was a major factor holding him back in the increasingly Trumpian state of Ohio.  In order to win, he'd need to reframe his past criticism of the 45th US president and seek his endorsement. It reportedly all started with a meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida around February 2021. According to The New York Times, Vance took the opportunity to personally apologise to Trump, telling him he was sorry that he'd bought into a narrative framed by the mainstream media. It's a pivotal conversation that Vance recounted on Monday night at the Republican National Convention, in his first televised interview with Fox News after accepting the appointment. \"I don't hide from that. I was certainly sceptical of Donald Trump in 2016. But President Trump was a great president and he changed my mind. I think he changed the minds of a lot of Americans because, again, he delivered that peace and prosperity,\" he said. Vance was also among vocal Republicans sympathetic to Trump's claims that the 2020 election result was rigged. And he has openly criticised former vice-president Mike Pence over his actions on January 6. Ultimately, Trump decided to endorse Vance in his race for an Ohio Senate seat in 2022. Trump endorsed Vance in his bid for a Senate spot in 2022.  (Reuters: Gaelen Morse) \"Like some others, JD Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,\" Trump said at the time. \"He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race.\" It's a factor Vance acknowledges was crucial to his success. \"I would not have won that race without Donald Trump's endorsement, and the president's trust then and his partnership since then has been something I value a great deal,\" he told Fox News yesterday. \"President Trump did a really good job, and I actually think it's a good thing when you see somebody you were wrong about him. You ought to admit the mistake and admit that wrong.\" Vance's ticket to success was also apparently helped along by Trump's two sons, Don Jr and Eric, who are big fans of the Ohioan. Trump's sons Eric (pictured) and Donald Jr are believed to be fans of Vance.  (AP: Julia Nikhinson) On Monday morning, he received the call that the former president wanted him to join the 2024 campaign as his running mate.  \"It tells me the Donald Trump could have made one of two decisions to try and expand his base or the election map,\" Republican strategist Doug Heye told the ABC. \"Choosing a Glenn Youngkin from Virginia, [or] potentially Nikki Haley, could appeal to different voters. Or he could do what Donald Trump always does, which is double down. \"JD Vance is seen very much as not just a supporter of the president's, but a younger version of that. And so I don't think it's terribly surprising to see that the Trump campaign has gone in this direction.\" Described by Joe Biden as a \"clone\" of Donald Trump, the staunch conservative aligns with his running mate on everything from abortion to the war in Ukraine. Describing himself as pro-life, Vance's views on abortion appear to have shifted over the past few years much like a populist politician, from outright support for a national ban, to a slightly more moderate view that aligns with Trump's recent stance. In 2021, he compared abortion to slavery, arguing it had \"a morally distorting effect on the entire society\". In another interview that same year, he argued against exceptions for rape and incest, saying: \"I think two wrongs don't make a right.\" \"It's not whether women should be forced to bring a child to term, it's whether a child should be allowed to live even though the circumstances of that child's birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to the society,\" he told the Spectrum News podcast Dear Ohio. By the mid-terms in 2022, Vance was less definitive. While supporting a national ban on elective abortions after 15 weeks, he said he did believe in some exceptions. When his state voted to guarantee abortion rights in its constitution in November last year, Vance described the moment as \"a gut punch\". \"We have to recognise how much voters mistrust us (meaning elected Republicans) on this issue … we need people to see us as the pro-life party, not just the anti-abortion party,\" he wrote on social media platform X. Vance appears to be echoing Trump in distancing himself from more hardline anti-abortion policies floated by Project 2025, a group of leading conservative organisations aiming to shape the policy agenda for a second Trump presidency. Trump's march to re-take the White House defiantly continues. If he wins he'll have an \"army\" of 10,000 recruits at his disposal to help implement his controversial agenda. \"Donald Trump is the pragmatic leader here. He's saying most abortion policy is going to be decided by the states. We want to make it easier and more affordable for young women and parents to have families to begin with,\" he told NBC's Meet The Press last weekend. While promoting himself as a defender of American family values, Vance has voted against bills to enshrine nationwide rights to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technology. The first-term senator has also taken a hard line against LGBTQI+ rights, introducing federal legislation to ban gender-affirming care for children, and railing against educational discussions about sexual and gender identity in schools. In campaigning for his Senate seat, he declared he would oppose the Respect for Marriage Act, which requires all US states and territories to recognise same-sex and interracial marriages. The bill was passed before Vance was sworn in. Overseas, Vance has praised policies of Hungary's far-right leader Viktor Orban incentivising families to have more children and exerting control over state-run universities. \"They offer loans to new married couples that are forgiven at some point later if those couples eventually stay together and have children. Why can't we do that here?\" he said in an address to the Intercollegiate Studies Institute in July 2021. In an interview with The European Conservative in February, Vance described the crackdown on universities as \"the closest that conservatives have ever gotten to successfully dealing with left-wing domination of universities\". Vance (right) has been described as a Trump (left) \"clone\" when it comes to key policies, and a younger version of the former president in terms of voter appeal. (AP: Evan Vucci) Vance has been a vocal critic of the US' involvement in the war in Ukraine and was central to Republican-led efforts to block a foreign aid package that included $US60 million ($89.08 million) for Volodymyr Zelenskyy's troops. \"If I'm Ukraine, I'm very nervous about this,\" Mr Heye said.  \"But ultimately, as we've learned with everything in the Republican Party over the past few years, if Donald Trump makes a decision, his supporters back it to the hilt.  \"I could see him trying to do something where he tries to end this war and end it, well, for Ukraine. And every Republican essentially would stand behind him to do so.\" Immigration is the other contentious, wedge issue that Vance has capitalised on and largely echoes Trump's sentiment. The southern border, which divides Americans down ideological lines, was the first subject Vance featured in campaign ads in his race for a Senate seat in Ohio. \"Joe Biden's open border is killing Ohioans, with more illegal drugs and more Democrat voters pouring into this country,\" he says to camera. He even turns the issue personal by recounting how his mother was beset by the scourge of drugs flooding in from Mexico. From completing construction of Trump's border wall to a merit-based system for immigrants seeking asylum, Vance has argued that undocumented migrants are taking jobs from hardworking Americans and undercutting local wages. The young father of three and husband of the daughter of Indian immigrants, Vance injects energy into a race that's being fought between a 78-year-old and an 81-year-old.  Mr Heye said, ultimately, he would have recommended Trump choose a more diverse VP candidate to help him increase his base of voters, but his decision to choose a younger version of himself indicated he was confident with recent polling. Vance, pictured with his wife Usha, paints himself as a defender of American family values. (AP: Carolyn Kaster) \"I certainly would have recommended somebody to increase that base again,\" he said. “Youngkin and Haley … a Sarah Huckabee Sanders, or at least someone potentially who could help the campaign communicate to women. Tim Scott, as a prominent African American Republican, I think all could have been good choices.  \"Trump has decided, obviously, to double down here. And it tells us that he's confident not just in his pick, but where he is in the campaign thus far.\"  If successful in November, Vance would be one of the youngest vice-presidents in US history. And looking beyond 2024, regardless of the result, he becomes a viable option for the Republican ticket in 2028. \"If Donald Trump wins, then his vice-president JD Vance would be, if not the frontrunner, certainly one of the people at the top of the list for the next Republican nomination. If Trump were to lose, that still could be possible as well,\" Mr Heye said. Vance has clearly proven he's loyal to Trump, despite once being a vocal critic. But the real test of his obedience will come if he's confronted with and willing to break the law for his leader where Mike Pence wouldn't.

Officials have yet to determine the 20-year-old gunman's motive for carrying out the attack on former president Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. The incident injured the Republican presidential candidate, killed a 50-year-old volunteer firefighter and left two others critically injured. Crooks was killed by Secret Service snipers after firing several shots from a nearby rooftop. The ABC has recreated the scene of the fatal rally in Pennsylvania. Senior FBI officials told America's NBC News technicians at the bureau's laboratory in Quantico were still forensically analysing Crooks's phone and laptop. The FBI said it had taken a day to unlock the phone without help from an outside firm. \"The investigation is still in the early stages,\" an FBI statement said. \"The FBI has conducted nearly 100 interviews of law enforcement personnel, event attendees, and other witnesses. That work continues.\" Crooks, a registered Republican, was a member of a shooting club near his home in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about an hour's drive from the rally in the town of Butler. Investigators say Crooks visited the shooting club the day before the shooting, and practised firing. A view of the Clairton Sportsmen's Club, where Thomas Matthew Crooks was a member. (Reuters: Carlos Osorio ) The following morning he drove to a Home Depot hardware store and bought a 1.5-metre ladder, and to a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition. According to CNN, which cited multiple law enforcement officials, he told his boss he needed the day off on Saturday because he had \"something to do\". He reportedly told coworkers he would be back at work on Sunday. Thomas Matthew Crooks. (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) Then he drove to the Trump rally. Inside his car, according to investigators, was an improvised explosive device which was linked to a transmitter he carried with him. More details about the device are expected to be released in the coming days. Crooks reportedly arrived about three hours before the shooting, and raised suspicion with security when he was found carrying a \"rangefinder\", a device used by hunters and target shooters to measure distance. The motive behind the shooting remains largely a mystery for police. Crooks carried no identification with him, forcing authorities to use his DNA to confirm his identity in the early hours of Sunday morning US time. He was not under FBI surveillance before the incident. Multiple police including the bomb squad were seen surrounding the shooter's home in Bethel Park following the attack.  (Reuters:  Carlos Osorio ) After graduating from Bethel Park High School in 2022 Crooks attended a community college and began working as a dietary aide at a nursing and rehabilitation centre. Special agent Kevin Rojek told media the FBI had \"not identified an ideology associated with the subject\". Searches of his online activity have so far not revealed any suspicious activity, instead showing an interest in chess, video games, and learning to code. Despite being a registered Republican, the upcoming election would have been the first time Crooks was old enough to vote. A National Security Council spokesperson said there was no known link between Crooks and any \"accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic\". An all-senators phone briefing is set to be held on Wednesday afternoon US time to discuss the assassination attempt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office said the phone briefing would include representatives from the Justice Department, Secret Service, and the FBI.

A threat from Iran prompted the US Secret Service to boost protection around Donald Trump before the weekend's attempted assassination of the former president, though it appears unrelated to the rally attack, according to two US officials. Upon learning of the threat, the Biden administration reached out to senior officials at the Secret Service to make them aware, the officials said, adding it was shared with the lead agent on Trump's protection detail and the Trump campaign.  That prompted the agency to surge resources and assets. Follow live: Latest updates from second day of the Republican National Convention However, the additional resources did not prevent an attempted assassination of the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania.  There is no indication that the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was connected to the Iranian plot, the sources said.  The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. The ABC has recreated the scene of the fatal rally in Pennsylvania. Trump ordered the killing of Qasem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's Quds Force, in 2020. Iran's Permanent Mission to the US told CNN the accusations were \"unsubstantiated and malicious\".  \"From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani,\" the statement read.  \"Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice.\" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the threats stemmed from Iran's desire for revenge for the killing of Soleimani. \"As we have said many times, we have been tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years, dating back to the last administration,\" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.  \"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority.\" Ms Watson said the investigation into the attempted assassination of the former president was active and ongoing.  \"At this time, law enforcement has reported that their investigation has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic,\" she said. She added the National Security Council had \"repeatedly\" met at the highest levels to develop and implement a comprehensive response to such threats.  \"As part of that comprehensive response, we have invested extraordinary resources in developing additional information about these threats, disrupting individuals involved in these threats, enhancing the protective arrangements of potential targets of these threats, engaging with foreign partners, and directly warning Iran.\"  Federal law enforcement officials were also warning of possible copycat attacks or election-related retaliation after the attempt on Trump's life, as a visibly stronger security detail surrounded President Joe Biden, and independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr received Secret Service protection.

Look back through our blog to see how the day's events unfolded.   By Elissa Steedman This is where we'll leave our live coverage of the second day of the Republican National Convention. Here's a quick recap of today: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Elissa Steedman A new accessory is among the Republican fashions today. Some convention-goers are wearing bandages over their ears, in reference to Trump's shooting injury. By Elissa Steedman Former Australian ambassador to the US Joe Hockey and current ambassador, Kevin Rudd, have spoken about Trump's \"sharper and clearer\" campaign platform.  \"On the policy lines, it is sharper and clearer than it was last time round,\" Rudd said in the interview for Sky News Australia. \"What I think is different is the aggregation of individuals who would fill the key cabinet and advisory positions, who now approach this with four years of experience under their belt – that therefore makes it a more determined policy push. \"The bottom line is, you see greater discipline in the Trump campaign than you did back then.\" Hockey suggested there is currently a \"level of despair\" among Democrats over Biden's refusal to step aside.  \"At this stage, if Donald Trump gives a measured speech on Thursday night, he can win by seven points. \"If he gives an acrimonious speech, a traditional speech, he's going to bring Biden back into the fold and into play.\" By Elissa Steedman A man armed with an AK-47 and wearing a ski mask was taken into custody yesterday near the Fiserv Forum, where the Republican National Convention is being held. A federal law enforcement official said the 21-year-old was arrested after encountering US Capitol Police and Homeland Security Investigations agents. The officers approached the man, who was carrying a tactical backpack and wearing a mask, because he appeared to be acting suspiciously, an official said. Police found the weapon in his backpack. The official was not authorised to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Reporting by AP By Elissa Steedman This type of event isn't limited to just the Republicans. The Democrats will hold their own convention from Monday, August 19 to Thursday, August 22.  They'll be gathering in Chicago, Illinois, which is considered a Democratic stronghold. But while Trump was formally nominated as the Republican Party candidate at the Republican National Convention, the Democrats may do things differently for Biden. There's currently a plan to speed up the official party approval of Biden's re-election bid amid calls for a change to the Democratic ticket. By Elissa Steedman FBI technicians are combing through the phone and computer data of Trump's would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks as they continue to hunt for a motive. The 20-year-old visited a gun range and a hardware store in the lead-up to the attack.  You can continue reading this update by Brianna Morris-Grant via the link below. By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke Senior Democrats are calling for a US Senator to resign after he was found guilty of corruption. Senator Bob Menendez from the state of New Jersey was found guilty of 16 counts related to a scheme where he received bribes, including gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz. He was also found guilty of illegally acting as an agent for the Egyptian government. Senator Menendez had previously served as the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says Senator Menendez should do the right thing and resign. Menendez faces the potential of decades in jail for his crimes.  He's defiant though and is still running to hold his senate seat, as an independent. By Elissa Steedman Trump's VIP box became a bit of a revolving door today. Senators and representatives have been dropping by to speak with the former president and his running mate. Among the visitors have been Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ben Carson, Don Jr and Eric and Tiffany Trump. By Jessica Riga Lara Trump was the last speaker of the second day of the convention, which continues for the rest of the week. It's after 10pm in Milwaukee. By Jessica Riga Lara Trump is using her speech to ham up her family connection to Donald Trump. \"Last Saturday was a jarring reminder that… there is more than unites us than divides us. We all want this country to be great,\" she says. She hits out at the \"out of touch celebrities on the left\" who criticise Trump, and says she wishes everyone could know the Republican candidate like she does, as a \"wonderful man\" as her father-in-law. She says Trump didn't run for president for \"fame or money\" because \"he had plenty of that.\" He ran \"because he loves this country.\" \"As he was jostled off stage [after the shooting], he knew how defining that moment would be for our country, and he hoisted his fist in the air.\" The crowds starts clapping and chanting \"fight, fight, fight.\" By Jessica Riga Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law and the co-chair of the Republican National Convention, has taken to the stage as the last speaker of the day. She's the first family member to speak at the convention this week. She says she changed her speech following the attempted assassination at the rally over the weekend. \"Nothing prepares you for a moment like that,\" she says. \"Our family has faced our fair share of death threats. \"None of that prepares you, as a daughter-in-law, to watch in real time someone try to kill someone you care about.\" By Jessica Riga As I mentioned before, Marco Rubio was in the running to join Trump on the ticket, but JD Vance was selected instead. Rubio still gave him a shout out during his time on the stage. \"There is absolutely nothing dangerous or anything divisive about putting Americans first,\" Rubio said. \"Anyone who is offended about putting America first has forgotten what America is and what America means. \"As the life story of our next vice president JD Vance reminds us, we are all descendants of ordinary people who achieve extraordinary things.\" Rubio urged the arena to \"fight not with violence\" but \"with our voices and our votes.\" By Jessica Riga Florida senator Marco Rubio is up now. Donald Trump ridiculed him as \"little Marco\" when they were both chasing the party's nomination in 2016 (Rubio also mocked Trump's \"small hands\"). More recently, Rubio was in the running to become Trump's running mate, but the gig went to JD Vance. By Jessica Riga Sarah Huckabee Sanders became the governor of Arkansas in 2023, but before that she was White House press secretary during the Trump years. \"Not even an assassin's bullet could stop him,\" she says, taking to the stage at the Republican National Convention. \"God Almighty intervened because America is one nation under God and he is certainly not finished with president Trump.\" She reminisces on her time in her previous role, calling it \"the best job\" before throwing a jab at not just the US president, but the first lady as well. \"When I was White House press secretary I got the chance to take my four-year-old son, Huck, to work. Much like how Jill drags Joe to bring your husband to work day.\" By Elissa Steedman Earlier today, Donald Trump Jr was interviewed by Axios co-founder Mike Allen at an event outside the Republican National Convention.  Trump Jr said the speech his father will give at the convention on Thursday, has been changed to \"de-escalate some of that rhetoric\". \"It was hot and by the way, I think it probably should have been at that time but a lot changes when you get shot in the face.\" When asked how long the \"new Trump\" will last, Trump Jr said he thinks the impact of the assassination attempt will stay with his father. \"I think it lasts. There are events that change you for a couple minutes and there are events that change you permanently.\" Trump Jr added he expects his father will be still be \"reactionary\". \"He's not just going to take an attack, he's not just going to be labelled whatever they decide to label him and just let that slide.  \"My father will always be a fighter, that's never going to change. \"But I think he's going to do his best to moderate that with where it needs to be.\" By Elissa Steedman Florida Governor Ron DeSantis launched into his speech by criticising Joe Biden. \"I am alarmed that the current President of the United States lacks the ability to discharge the duties of his office.  \"Our enemies do not confine their designs to between 10am and 4pm. \"We need a commander-in-chief who can lead 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" That's a reference to a report by Axios last month, which cited aides inside the White House suggesting most of Biden's public events are held between 10am and 4pm because that's when he is \"dependably engaged\". By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been on the receiving end of a decent share of Trump attacks. Donald Trump loved to call him \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" while they were competing to become the Republican candidate for president. But DeSantis, unlike Haley, endorsed Trump shortly after he withdrew from the primary race. And tonight he's all in for the former president:  \"Donald Trump has been demonised. He's been sued. He's been prosecuted. And he nearly lost his life.  \"We cannot let him down, and we cannot let America down.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania For a while there, Nikki Haley was perhaps Trump's most prominent adversary in the GOP. Tonight, she closed the loop and came full circle to fall back in behind the former president. While in the White House, Trump tapped Haley to be America's ambassador to the UN. But when she was taking him on for the party's presidential nomination, she attracted support from voters – and big donors – opposed to the Trump-ification of the Republican Party. Haley described Trump as \"unhinged\", called him a \"bully\", and said he was \"obsessed with himself\" and \"getting meaner\" every day. Trump called Haley \"bird brain\". When she dropped out of the race in March, she refused to endorse him, instead challenging him to \"earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him\". But tensions soon eased. In May, she confirmed she would vote for Trump. And before this week, she urged the delegates who were going to vote for her at the convention to instead vote for Trump. Tonight, she made clear she was now endorsing her former foe for the sake of party unity: \"We have a chance to put aside our differences and focus on what unites us and strengthens our country,\" she said. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania She's told the convention: \"We should acknowledge that there are some Americans who don't agree with Donald Trump 100 per cent of the time. I happen to know some of them, and I want to speak to them tonight. \"My message to them is simple. \"You don't have to agree with Trump 100 per cent of the time to vote for him. \"Take it from me. I haven't always agreed with President Trump, but we agree more often than we disagree. \"We agree on keeping America strong. \nWe agree on keeping America safe. And we agree that Democrats have moved so far to the left that they're putting our freedoms in danger. \"I'm here tonight because we have a country to save, and a unified Republican Party is essential for saving her.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania It's something she refused to do after she dropped out of the primary race against him. The former governor of South Carolina, who also served as the American ambassador to the UN during Trump's presidency, engaged in an at-times bitter primary contest against the former president.  But tonight, after walking in to a less enthusiastic welcome than most of the other speakers, she said: \"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity. \"It was a gracious invitation, and I was happy to accept.  \"I'll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden's day took a turn when a COVID-19 diagnosis whisked him away from scheduled campaign events and into isolation, at a time when his support within the party is looking fragile. These are the biggest moments from another day in US politics.  Things went from bad to worse for the president, with pressure mounting on him to drop out of the race and an inconveniently timed case of COVID-19.  On Thursday morning, California representative Adam Schiff became the 20th Democrat in Congress to call for the president to consider bowing out. \"While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,\" Schiff said in a statement.  Reports also emerged on Thursday that one of the most senior Democrats in Congress, Senate leader Chuck Schumer, called Biden on Saturday to make the case that it would be best if he bowed out. Schiff, a representative for California, is running for a Senate spot in November. (Reuters: Aude Guerrucci) So far, the president seems reluctant to do so. In an interview with BET News, he said the only factor that could potentially see him drop out would be \"if there was some medical condition that emerged ... if the doctors came to me and said, 'you've got this problem'\". \"When I originally ran ... I said I was going to be a transitional candidate. And I thought that I'd be able to move from this, and just pass it on to someone else. But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided.\" Just as it seemed things couldn't get much worse, the president came down with a case of COVID-19.  According to a statement from the White House, the president tested positive on Thursday morning and is experiencing mild symptoms, with a runny nose and dry cough.  He cancelled his scheduled campaign events and hopped straight on a plane from Nevada back to his home in Delaware, where he will remain isolated as he rides out the illness while continuing his usual duties. It comes at a difficult time for the president — aside from the campaign, he's due to host Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week. The White House has yet to confirm whether those plans will need to be adjusted. Joe Biden is experiencing \"mild symptoms\" including \"general malaise\" from COVID, the White House says. (AP: Susan Walsh) Some Americans know JD Vance from his bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. Others have seen the Netflix adaptation starring Amy Adams and Glenn Close. But many have never heard of him. So tonight was a chance for the freshman Ohioan senator to introduce himself to a public he hopes will install him as vice-president. JD Vance didn't know he'd be speaking as Donald Trump's running mate until he was told earlier in the week. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) He began his speech by heaping praise on Donald Trump – a man he once said he'd never support. \"He's tough, he is, but he cares about people. He can stand against an assassin one moment and call for national healing the next. He is a beloved father and grandfather and, of course, a once-in-a-generation business leader.\" Vance's speech came at the end of an evening that had been dominated by foreign policy talk, with an official theme-of-the-day of \"Make America Strong Once Again\".  When Donald Trump first took office, JD Vance boldly declared he would never support him. So how did this conservative venture capitalist-turned-politician win over the former president to become his pick for Republican vice-president? But he steered mostly clear of the subject, except to push some isolationist and America First ideals. \"We will protect the wages of American workers and stop the Chinese Communist Party from building their middle class on the backs of American citizens,\" he said. He didn't specifically refer to Ukraine, whose war effort he has opposed supporting with ongoing military aid, but said:  \"We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer. \" Unsurprisingly, he spoke more about his personal story than policy, drawing on some of the subject matter that inspired his book, and satisfying Republican strategy to soften the image of the party and its leadership. JD Vance took the opportunity to introduce himself to Americans, sharing some of his personal story. (AP: Evan Vucci) He spoke at length about his \"tough as nails\" mamaw (\"the name we hillbillies gave to our grandmothers\"). He remembered her as a woman with deep Christian faith, but one who \"loved the f-word\" and had 19 loaded handguns stashed around her house. She raised him as his own mother struggled with addiction, he said. After telling that story, he pointed to his mother in the crowd. \"Ten years, clean and sober,\" Vance announced, before suggesting they celebrate the milestone in the White House \"if President Trump's OK with it\". He ended his speech with a pledge: \"I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from.\"  It's a pitch to voters from less privileged backgrounds, and those many Americans facing cost-of-living stress, who may find it hard to personally relate to Donald Trump. Several members of the Trump family took the stage at the convention on Thursday ahead of the main event. Campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Trump's son Donald Jr, was first to the podium with a passionate spiel on freedom, liberty and the American dream.  Donald Trump Jr's partner and Trump campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle was among the speakers on day three.  (AP: J. Scott Applewhite) \"The powerful elites in the swamp will say anything to crush and destroy the America First movement, but we will never give up and neither will Donald Trump,\" she told the crowd. Her fiancé's 17-year-old daughter Kai, the former president's granddaughter, made a brief appearance. Who better to push the message on prime-time TV that Trump's a good guy? Donald Trump Jr invited his 17-year-old daughter Kai on stage to speak about her grandfather. (Reuters: Jeenah Moon) She told the crowd Trump was like any other grandfather, despite the media making him look \"like a different person\".  \"He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren’t looking,\" she said. Both she and her father, Don Jr, spoke at some length about the assassination attempt on Trump. The crowd erupted in cheers as big screens displayed the now iconic photograph of Trump after he was shot in Pennsylvania.  \"I've never been prouder of my father than I was in that moment,\" Don Jr said.  The projection of the iconic photo from the assassination attempt drew cheers from the crowd. (Reuters: Mike Segar) Among the other speakers on day three was former Trump administration official Peter Navarro.  The ex-adviser was released from a Florida prison on Thursday after serving four months for refusing to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the January 6 Capitol riots. Peter Navarro flew directly to the Republican National Convention after he was released from jail. (AP: J. Scott Applewhite) He got straight on a plane to Milwaukee to pump up the party faithful ahead of JD Vance's address. \"You folks just wanna know if you can see my MAGA tattoo that I got in there,\" was his opening line to the raucous crowd. Attacking what he called the \"Department of Injustice\" and describing the January 6 committee as a \"sham\", he said he had a \"very simple message\".   \"If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful, they will come for you. If we don't control our government, their government will control us.\" The biggest boos came when he mentioned former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Attorney-General Merrick Garland.  The convention wraps up on Friday (AEST), with Donald Trump due to address the party that has chosen him as their 2024 presidential candidate.

Look back through our blog to see how the day's events unfolded.   By Elissa Steedman This is where we'll leave our live coverage of the third day of the Republican National Convention. Here's a quick recap of today: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Elissa Steedman While conventions these days act more as rallying opportunities, that hasn't always been the case.  Until the 1970s, the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were a genuine political process. By Elissa Steedman We heard from Donald Trump Jr's teenage daughter earlier in the night. The 17-year-old is Donald Trump's eldest granddaughter and an avid golfer, who frequently shares footage of herself on the green. According to the Golf Handicap Information Network, she has an impressive handicap of 0.5. That makes her a considerably better golfer than her grandfather, who claims to have a handicap of 2.8. By Elissa Steedman Russia's top diplomat is welcoming Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance's support for ending US aid to Ukraine and says Moscow will work with any American leader \"willing to engage in equitable, mutually respectful dialogue\". Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a UN news conference Vance is in favor of peace and \"that's what we need — to stop pumping Ukraine full of weapons\". \"Then, the war will end and then we can look for solutions,\" he said. Vance wants the US to attend to its own problems — even though he has said Putin was wrong to invade. That view dovetails with presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has claimed that if elected, he would end the conflict before Inauguration Day in January, though he has declined to say how. The Russian minister stressed any solution in Ukraine must take into consideration both the situation on the ground and the reality of political life. Reporting by AP By North America correspondent Barbara Miller Late in the evening Joe Biden stepped off Air Force One in his home state of Delaware. He’s come back after testing positive for COVID, but there's not likely to be much rest from the pressure for him to reconsider his decision to remain in the race. Adam Schiff is the public blow to the President today, but behind the scenes the backgrounding is in full swing. Let’s just take you through a few of the latest reports that major US media are attributing to sources speaking on condition of anonymity. ABC America said the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer had told the President it would be better if he bowed out. Schumer did not explicitly deny this, a spokesman saying merely it was “idle speculation”. The Washington Post reported that Chuck Schumer and the most senior Democrat in the House Hakeem Jeffries had told Biden in separate meetings that if he continued his candidacy it would hamper the party’s chances in the House and Senate in elections also taking place in November. The New York Times reported that Joe Biden was at least receptive to hearing arguments about why he might drop out of the race. And CNN reports that senior Democrat and former speaker Nancy Pelosi has told the President the polls show he can’t win. Joe Biden could easily dismiss this kind of reporting, saying show me someone on the record, but the onslaught of leaks weakens him and suggests the tide could be turning.  By Elissa Steedman Former Trump defence official  Elbridge A Colby says JD Vance expects Europeans to take \"the bulk of the responsibility for supporting Ukraine\". Speaking with ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland, Colby said the Trump-Vance platform isn't about isolationism, but putting American interests first. By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke Before he was diagnosed with COVID, President Joe Biden sat down for an interview with Black Entertainment Television (BET). Bits of the interview were released earlier, including him saying he'd only leave the race if he received medical advice to do so. The full sit-down has since gone to air.  Unfortunately for the President, it wasn't a commanding performance and there were notable stumbles in what was a fairly non-confrontational interview. At one point he wanted to focus on how he'd managed to lower prescription drug prices, which he thinks is particularly relevant for the Black community. But what came out was: \"All the folks in the Black community have prescription drug problems.\" Then, realising he'd misspoken, he tried to explain.  The garbled follow seemed to be: \"They're a lot of money. You have diabetes, you have, you know, you need insulin.\" It had echoes of his woeful debate performance. At one point the interviewer gave him a softball question about why Black America should vote Biden. This should have been a home run. He should have been able to rattle off a succinct list of his policies. He started with: \"Because they know where my heart is. They know where my head is.\" But then, instead of marketing himself and his presidency, he decided to argue that it didn't matter if the polls were bad because young people aren't yet paying attention.  \"By the way, if you notice, whether it's young Blacks or young whites or young Hispanics or young Asian Americans, they've never focused until after Labor Day.\" Given his recent diagnosis, it will be Biden's last in-person interview for a while. The series of sit-downs he's recently engaged in were supposed to restore confidence in his mental acuity after his woeful debate.  This outing won't have helped. By Elissa Steedman Before Trump arrived at the convention, his VIP box wasn't going to waste. Among the notable people spotted was model and rapper Amber Rose, as well as some of his more vocal supporters like Representatives Monica De La Cruz, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Vivek Ramaswamy. By Elissa Steedman JD Vance has just wrapped his first speech since being nominated as the Republican Party's vice presidential candidate. Planet America host John Barron says the contents would have \"delighted\" Trump and the former president's campaign. By Elissa Steedman With JD Vance's speech finished, the Republicans have called time on the third day of the convention. It's almost 11pm in Milwaukee. Donald Trump will make his first address since the attempted assassination tomorrow. By North America correspondent Barbara Miller This is a huge step up for JD Vance.  From freshman Senator to VP candidate in the space of a few days. The 39 year-old seemed a little nervous.  A couple of times he tried to begin speaking again before waiting for the applause to settle. Once he confused the words he was reading from the teleprompter.  He found momentum at times, but it felt on the whole a little underwhelming as a performance.  The campaign has rejected an offer by Kamala Harris to debate JD Vance, saying they can’t accept because they don’t know who the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee will be. The implication being that Joe Biden will no longer be in the race. It’s a clever way of saying no, but I can’t help thinking maybe JD Vance is not quite ready for Kamala Harris. The Vice-President has low popularity ratings, but she’s been in the political arena a lot longer than JD Vance and would likely be a formidable opponent.  Perhaps the tone of JD Vance’s speech will be less important than the messaging around his hillbilly backstory. One of the most powerful moments of the speech was when he called out to his Mum in the audience, who has struggled with addiction, but who he said was “10 years clean and sober.” By Jessica Riga By Elissa Steedman There's been another break in Vance's speech as the crowd applauds his mother in the VIP box, chanting \"JD's mum!\". Vance has spoken about being raised by his grandparents while his mother struggled with a drug addiction. \"Our movement is about single mums like mine, who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up. \"I'm proud to say tonight that my mum is here, 10 years clean and sober. I love you mum.\" The vice presidential candidate noted she will \"officially\" be 10 years clean in January, 2025. \"And if President Trump's ok with it, let's have the celebration in the White House.\" Trump was smiling after that line. By Jessica Riga In his first official speech to the party faithful, JD Vance says the Republican party of the next four years will be \"united in our love for this country and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas.\" By Elissa Steedman Vance's speech was briefly paused by a standing ovation when he formally accepted his nomination as the Republican Party's vice-presidential candidate. He's continuing his address with a run-through on \"career politician\" Joe Biden's political record. \"We need a leader who will stand up for American companies.\" By Elissa Steedman The vice-presidential candidate has touched on recent calls by Donald Trump for unity. \"I want to respond to his call for unity myself.  \"We have a big tent in this party on everything from national security to economic policy. \"But my message to you, my fellow Republicans, is we love this country and we are united to win.\" Vance says the Republican Party of the next four years will be \"united in our love for this country and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas\". By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan A video just played at the convention, introducing JD Vance, that gives us some insights into the messaging we’re likely to see from his vice-presidential campaign.  It chartered his personal story, outlined in his best-selling book, from growing up in poverty in a family affected by addiction to later entering the US Senate.  “Only in America is this story possible,” the voice over said, framing Vance as someone who’d achieved the American dream and could relate to people doing it tough.   In an election where the cost of living will be a huge issue, Republicans are likely hoping Vance will come across as someone who personally understands those pressures - perhaps more than Donald Trump. By Elissa Steedman Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance is making his first address since he was chosen as Donald Trump's running mate. The Ohio-born politician was met with chants of \"JD\" from the crowd as he walked out. \"Tonight is a night of hope, a celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it soon will be once again,\" he started. He's now reflecting on the attempted assassination of Trump. By Jessica Riga Usha Vance is on stage introducing her husband, but admits that's a hard task when he's already written a memoir that's been turned into a film by Ron Howard. She talks about how the pair met at law school and were friends first because \"everyone wanted to be friends with JD.\" As they grew closer, she says JD \"approached our differences with curiosity and enthusiasm. \"The same JD I knew then, is the JD you see now.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan A huge cheer just went up inside the convention when the screen behind Don Jr displayed that now famous photo of Donald Trump with his fist in the air, shortly after being shot at. People in the crowd started chanting \"fight, fight, fight\", the words uttered by Trump in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt that have since become a rallying cry for Republicans. Don Jr told the crowd they would fight, with their voices, their ideas and their votes.

The Secret Service had previously said the building was outside their security perimeter. A number of inquiries are underway as to how Thomas Crooks was able to evade security and fire into the Trump rally. The gunman who tried to assassinate Donald Trump fired from a rooftop that the US Secret Service had declared to be outside its security perimeter. Two of its former officials say this was a fatal omission by the agency. Local and state police said the building — 140 metres from the stage where Trump spoke — was not their responsibility, and the Secret Service confirmed it fell outside the area it had secured for the outdoor event. A pair of Pennsylvania police officers at the rally in Butler were checking a dispatch report of a suspicious person in the area when they confronted 20-year-old Thomas Crooks on the rooftop, Butler county sheriff Michael Slupe said in an interview. The roof of a building where a gunman was shot dead was not secured by the Secret Service. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) That exposed a major hole in the security, said Kenneth Valentine, a former senior Secret Service special agent. \"He shouldn't have been able to get up on the roof,\" he said.  Mr Valentine said the agency also should have had someone watching the rooftops and able to stop the threat as the next line of defence. The ABC has recreated the scene of the fatal rally in Pennsylvania. The oversight allowed Crooks to access the roof unimpeded and fire directly at Trump, grazing his ear, killing a rally goer and wounding two other attendees. The Secret Service, which is responsible for Trump's safety as both a former president and the Republican presidential candidate, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \"The Secret Service said the building was outside the perimeter. That's not true,\" said another former Secret Service agent in an interview.  The rooftop was about 135 metres from the rally stage, outside a Secret Service security perimeter. (ABC News: Digital News Graphics) \"This is a massive failure.\" Mr Slupe said Trump would not have been allowed to take the stage if police knew there was a suspicious individual on the roof. \"Listen, if he was on the roof, right, and we got that information and I heard that, I would never have let that president walk out onto that catwalk,\" he said. Both former Secret Service officials said the agency should have identified the building as a security risk and taken responsibility that it could not be accessed. Local Pittsburgh television station WPXI obtained an image of the phone and a transmitter found on the roof Crooks used to fire at the former president.  His motives for the shooting are still under investigation by the FBI.  Officials are yet to determine 20-year-old Thomas Crooks's motive for carrying out the attack on former president Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. The chairman of the US House oversight committee issued a subpoena on Wednesday to the director of the Secret Service, Kimberley Cheatle, to appear before the first hearing into the attempted assassination of Trump on Monday. Committee chair James Comer said the \"lack of transparency and failure to cooperate\" with the committee called into question Ms Cheatle's ability to lead the Secret Service. The director has agreed to appear before the committee on July 22. In a letter to Ms Cheatle, Mr Comer wrote the assassination attempt represented a \"total failure of the agency's core mission\" and demanded congressional oversight. The director of the Secret Service said in an interview with American ABC News on Monday she has no plans to resign but took responsibility for the security lapses. \"The buck stops with me. I am the director of the Secret Service,\" she said. The agency of roughly 7,800 staff is responsible for protecting presidents, vice presidents, their families, former presidents and their families. Three other inquiries into the shooting are underway: a bipartisan task force set up by House Speaker Mike Johnson, an inquiry by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, and an independent review of security at the rally announced by President Joe Biden.  Secret Service agents evacuated Donald Trump from the rally stage after a bullet pierced his right ear. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) A bloodied Trump was escorted off the stage by Secret Service agents after Thomas Crooks opened fire, and agency snipers killed the gunman within seconds of the shots. Trump said the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting.  Reuters/AP Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:World Politics Topic:Shootings Shootings US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Catch up on the day's events below.  By Brianna Morris-Grant Thank you all for joining us today! We're going to leave our coverage there, you can scroll back to catch up on the day's events. To get you started, here are some of the key moments: Tucker Carlson said he has watched the vision of the rally shooting '50 times' By Caitlin Rawling Donald Trump's vice-president pick JD Vance is set to headline a rally with the Republican candidate next week. Vance will be speaking in his home town of Middletown, Ohio. In an email sent to his supporters it says the rally will be held at a local high school, where he will be there for a few hours to chat to the locals. By Caitlin Rawling People have gone all out with their outfits and their accessories for the convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As it is known as the cheese state, some are wearing, bright yellow hats that look like blocks of cheese. One man has decided to go all out, wearing a suit that looks like it is made out of bricks. Another has been spotted with Trump-themed pants and socks. By Jordan Hayne The Australia Institute's Dr Emma Shortiss says Vice President Kamala Harris is the \"most obvious and well-placed candidate\". \"I think the party is interested in a show of unity and uniting behind that [potential] candidate,\" she says. \"[The party] would also like Joe Biden to have a graceful exit if he can anoint Kamala Harris as his successor.\" By Jordan Hayne Melania Trump has been notably absent from Donald Trump's campaign, but made an appearance for her husband's keynote address at the Republican National Convention. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Joe Biden's campaign is once again in crisis, with influential Democrats including Barack Obama reportedly expressing doubts about his ability to defeat Donald Trump. But the president's team has been watching Trump's speech, and it's issued a statement arguing he \"rambled on for well over an hour\" and presented \"an even more extreme vision for where he wants to take this country.\" After all the talk of a major shift in tone from Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt, Biden's campaign pointed to when he referred to former House speaker Nancy Pelosi as \"crazy\" and accused Democrats of \"cheating\" in the 2020 election. And it had this to say about that Hannibal Lecter reference. By Lucy Sweeney If you're struggling to keep up with the names that have voiced concerns about President Joe Biden remaining at the top of the Democratic ticket, I'm sure you're not alone. Brianna Morris-Grant has been keeping tabs on statements from high-profile Democrats here. By Brianna Morris-Grant By Brianna Morris-Grant Whatever Donald Trump says to the Republican National Convention, let's be blunt — it doesn't matter, writes the ABC's Leigh Sales. It matters, of course, that Trump is once again a presidential candidate and that he now fully defines one of America's two major political parties. It matters too that he may well occupy the White House for the next four years, influencing the lives of Americans during that period and beyond. By Brianna Morris-Grant ABC correspondent Barbara Miller has described the atmosphere inside the arena during the speech. \"This is the first time that we have heard from Donald Trump since that assassination attempt and he went into some detail about what that experience was like for him,\" she said. \"And he seemed to hold the crowd in that moment. \"They seemed to believe and he spoke of the hand of God coming down and elevating them ... it was an astounding moment here. \"It was like he was a pastor. It was like a religious sermon.\"  By Jessica Riga He's joined on stage by wife Melania. It looks like he whispers something in her ear before pulling back slightly and kissing her on the cheek. The rest of the Trump family and other VIPs join the pair on stage, as a flood of red, white, blue and gold balloons are released into the arena. By Jessica Riga \"Tonight I ask for your partnership, for your support, and I am humbly asking for your vote. I'd like your vote,\" Trump says. \"Everyday I will strive to honour the trust you have placed in me and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down.\" He gets begins a chant of \"win, win, win.\" By Jessica Riga Donald Trump said this speech would be more about unity, and this conclusion is definitely leaning more towards that vibe compared to the rest of the speech. \"For too long our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. We have given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families,\" he says. \"I am here tonight with the opposite message — your expectations are not big enough, not big enough.\" This gets a huge cheer and applause from the audience. \"It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless, we can do that. \"We're Americans, ambition is our heritage, greatness is our birth right, but as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach and that's not acceptable.\" By Jessica Riga Donald Trump is beginning to wrap up his speech, and comes full circle by going back to the attempted assassination. \"To conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended, we know that. \"And yet here we are tonight all gathered together talking about the future promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. It's called America! \"We live in a world of miracles, none of us knows God's plan or where life's adventure will take us.\" By Jessica Riga Donald Trump has been speaking for well over an hour at this point and he's jumping from one topic to another in quick succession. Without mentioning the Israel-Hamas war directly, at one point Trump says: \"I tell you this: We want our hostages back and they better be back before I assume office or you will be paying a very big price.\" The crowd breaks into a chant of \"bring them home.\" \"With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over,\" Trump says. By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Denise Zeman was standing behind me at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania. She came with her sister Suzanne and her friend Sara. She's also watching the former president's address on TV. Zeman texted me her thoughts not long after Trump took the stage: \"Trump 2024! We will win by a landslide. People are tired of this administration and the destruction of our country. \"President Trump will restore our nation. His effects will be felt around the world. TRUMP 2024.\" Denise said the experience at the rally prior to the shooting was amazing. \"To have that many people who have common sense and want to make our country great [left me] speechless. We arrived and were just in awe. We grabbed some shirts and hats. Then off to find our spot for president Trump's speech. Unfortunately cut short. \"Someone thought to assassinate our future president. Very disappointed that our country is not where we should be 2024. Sad day in Butler Pa. Once again Biden administration failed. Thank god and for all the guardian angels.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Donald Trump started this speech with a more subdued tone than usual as he detailed the assassination attempt and spoke about wanting to unify the country. He's refrained from using his nicknames for president Joe Biden or vice-president Kamala Harris (although he did refer to the former Democratic House Speaker as \"crazy Nancy Pelosi\"). But he again accused Democrats of \"weaponising the justice system\", arguing one way to bring the country together would be to drop the criminal cases against him. The former president is now repeating a lot of the messages we've heard at recent campaign rallies. He's described crossings at the border between the US and Mexico as an \"invasion\", arguing without evidence that people are being sent to the US from \"prisons, jails, mental institutions\" in other countries. He's also repeated his often-told joke about Hannibal Lecter, and again warned the world is on the brink of World War III. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania When Trump was shot at in Pennsylvania, he was showing the crowd a chart titled \"illegal immigration into the US\". It's now being displayed in every corner of the screen behind him. \"Last time I put up that chart, I never really got to look at it. \"But without that chart, I would not be here today.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Trump has named the president, but says he won't do it again. \"If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States ... added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. \"Only going to use the term once. Biden. I'm not going to use the name anymore.\" By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC In the past week, I've been checking in with some of the people I met as we scrambled to leave the Trump rally following the assassination attempt on the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania. Bryant Brzozowski and his fiancée Madison have been watching his speech from their home in western Pennsylvania. They say they're feeling hopeful and empowered. The pair was standing just metres from one of the men who was critically injured by a stray bullet on Saturday. \"I have great respect for the man,\" Bryant told me. \"There's no other person I'd rather have as my president. \"It truly takes great courage to get up in front of a large crowd not even a week after being shot. Despite being the primary target of the shooting he still payed his respects to Corey Comperatore. \"He is a strong, compassionate, and courageous… a true leader.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Carolyn Kaster) Throughout a 92-minute speech, during which he mentioned Joe Biden by name only once, Donald Trump recounted the bloody attempt on his life, pivoted from promoting unity to railing against \"witch-hunts\", and asked a roaring crowd of party faithful to send him back to the White House. It capped off the four-day Republican National Convention and a chaotic week in the US election campaign that has seen President Joe Biden under ever-increasing pressure to drop out of the race. These were the biggest moments from Friday. In keeping with his tried and true campaign tradition, Donald Trump walked on stage to a rendition of God Bless the USA, his name literally in lights on the stage behind. As he approached the podium to proudly accept his party's nomination, his team wheeled out the uniform of volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in last weekend's assassination attempt. It set the scene for the first half hour or so. \"I will tell you exactly what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time because it's actually too painful to tell,\" he began, before proceeding to paint the picture of the moments leading up to a bullet grazing his ear, coming within \"a quarter-inch\" of taking his life. He recalled the moment he turned his head to look at a chart on a screen to his right, and heard a loud whizzing sound before feeling something hit him \"really, really hard\" on his right ear. Then, he said, there was blood, \"just absolutely blood all over the place\". \"Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage,\" he recalled. Trump spent several minutes reflecting on the close call, at one point saying, \"I'm not supposed to be here tonight, I'm not supposed to be here,\" to which the crowd began chanting: \"Yes you are!\" \"I had God on my side,\" he said. \"If I had not moved my head at that last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be here tonight.\" He told the crowd he believed those who were at the rally last weekend thought he was dead, before he raised his fist into the air and chanted \"fight, fight, fight\". \"Once my clenched fist went up … the crowd realised I was OK and roared with pride for our country, like no pride I have ever heard before. For the rest of my life I will be grateful for the love shown by that audience,\" he said. Trump went on to honour Comperatore, \"an unbelievable person, everybody tells me\", and the two other \"great warriors\" who were wounded in the shooting, adding that he had met with the injured bystanders on Friday and raised $6 million for the three families affected. Trump kissed the helmet of Corey Comperatore, who died during the Pennsylvania rally during his acceptance speech. (AP: Matt Rourke) Paying tribute to Comperatore, Trump walked across the stage to the firefighter's uniform and kissed the helmet before asking the crowd to observe a moment of silence. \"This is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human greatness,\" he told them. Trump had flagged this would be a subdued speech, focusing on unity. \"In an age where our politics divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all citizens, we are one nation under God with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalise dissent or demonise political disagreement, which is what's been happening in our country,\" he declared. The pledge quickly pivoted into his argument that the Democrats were mounting \"partisan witch-hunts\" against him in the courts. He reminded the crowd that Florida judge Aileen Cannon, who he appointed in 2020, threw out the classified documents case against him on Monday. But he stopped short of his usual practice of attacking the prosecutors or judges who had ruled against him, instead pivoting to a moment of thanks for his wife Melania and the extended Trump family, his newly minted vice-presidential candidate JD Vance and close friends Dana White and Hulk Hogan. Biden wants to \"turn the temperature down\". But some MAGA supporters say it's about to be \"turned up to 1,000 Fahrenheit\". Shifting gears into pitching his vision for a second term, he promised borders would be secure, the economy would bounce back and peace would be restored. \"But we must first rescue our nation from failed and incompetent leadership,\" he added, without using Biden's name. About halfway through the speech, he did mention his opponent. \"If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States … added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done,\" he said. \"Only going to use the term once. Biden. I'm not going to use the name anymore.\" The Republican presidential candidate's wife, Melania Trump, has been mostly absent from the 2024 campaign trail, but she was sitting in the VIP box to watch her husband's speech tonight. Alongside Trump's running mate JD Vance and his wife Usha, with the rest of the Trump family filling the seats behind her, Melania smiled and waved as her husband thanked her for writing a \"beautiful letter\" calling for national unity. Melania Trump appeared at the convention just before her husband gave his speech. (Reuters: Mike Segar) Earlier in the evening, Eric Trump stepped up to the podium to introduce his father, weaving the backstory of Donald Trump's journey to the White House. Talking about his father's start as a business mogul in New York City, Eric told of how Trump \"had the Midas touch, and he turned those streets into gold\". Moving into politics \"was not a decision that would enrich his family\", Eric said, but one that he made out of a deep and profound love for his country. Donald Trump sat with his family while listening to his son Eric's speech. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) In sync with the tone set early on in this convention, he spent plenty of time connecting the various legal cases against Trump with the weekend's assassination attempt. \"My father has been persecuted, targeted by far-left Democrats funded by special-interest groups and hand-picked judges,\" he said. \"My father has been pulled off the ballots of states by radical justices attempting to defy the will of millions of Americans who adore who he is and what he stands for. \"My father even became the target of an assassin who almost killed America's single greatest hope for our future. \"This swamp is terrified of this incredible movement.\" Tucker Carlson was another high-profile name with a historically patchy relationship with Trump who took to the stage to endorse the Republican presidential candidate. The former Fox News anchor wrote of Trump in 2021: \"I hate him passionately.\" But after leaving the network and starting his own media outlet, Carlson hosted a sit-down interview with the former president last year when he bailed on the Republican presidential debate. The pair seem to have mended the friendship, with Carlson describing Trump as \"the funniest person I've ever met in my life\" and \"the leader of a nation\". Former wrestler Hulk Hogan spoke at the RNC in support of the Trump-Vance ticket. (Reuters: Mike Segar) Wrestling superstar Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt on stage to reveal a Trump-Vance muscle tee. He promised the crowd that once Trump was back in the White House, he'd be \"kicking butts\" and \"America is gonna start winning again!\" The Hulk warmed up the crowd for Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, who told the crowd he had been friends with Trump for 25 years. \"I'm in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I've ever met in my life,\" he said. While Republicans partied hard, President Joe Biden had another rough day, with a string of leaks and anonymous sources citing pressure for him to drop out of the race. The Washington Post reported that former president Barack Obama told allies in recent days that \"Biden's path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously reconsider the viability of his candidacy\". Ouch. As Joe Biden faces increasing calls to step aside from the presidential race, here are the Democrat voices speaking out against him so far. Several outlets reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presented polling to Biden that she argued shows he likely could not defeat Trump. Her office released a statement after the news broke saying that the \"feeding frenzy\" from anonymous sources \"misrepresents any conversations\" she may have had with the president. The New York Times also published a four-page letter sent by another prominent Democrat, January 6 committee lead Jamie Raskin, who reportedly wrote to the president comparing him to a tiring baseball pitcher: \"There is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out.\" The paper also reported several sources close to the president \"believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out\", while Reuters cited an anonymous source saying Biden was \"soul searching\" and \"thinking about this very seriously\". As pressure mounts on Joe Biden, the president is recovering from COVID-19 in Delaware. (AP: Susan Walsh) Asked about the Obama story, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby wouldn't be drawn into speculation. \"I'm not going to talk about my personal conversations with the president. I would never do that. And I can't confirm or speak to those reports in terms of what former officials may or may not be talking to allies about,\" he said.

Trump, for his part, had been planning to unleash on Biden in a \"really tough speech\" at this week's Republican National Convention, but said he threw it away after the shooting, and rewrote it \"to try to unite our country\". But inside the convention – a celebration of Trump and his MAGA vision with cult-like levels of fanaticism – there are plenty of doubts about America's ability to turn down the heat. \"The temperature will be up to 1,000 Fahrenheit,\" says Donna De Sapo, who took an all-day bus trip from Tennessee to Milwaukee with some friends for the convention. Like many attendees, she blames the media's \"lies\" and its \"demonisation\" of Trump for fuelling the anger burning through the country. For all the talk here of \"fake news\", she's happy to share her views with me, but pleads: \"Please report honestly.\" \"Look at the onslaught that this poor guy [Trump] has had from day one, since he went down the elevator in New York,\" Donna says. The sources of the country's problems, she believes, range from a judiciary that's been \"weaponised\" to go after Trump, to \"illegal aliens\" crossing the Mexican border and taking resources from poor American communities. They're among the common targets of anger at this event, where the widely held view seems to be the temperature can only be lowered if the other side of politics cools it down. After a week of raucous celebrations with the party faithful – some of whom have donned ear patches to support their recovering hero – Trump's speech will be the clearest indicator of where the temperature could be headed. To get a sense of where those words will land with his most loyal followers, come inside the Republican National Convention. I encountered Donna and her friends at \"Convention Fest\", part of this sprawling event that's seen a Milwaukee street overtaken by white food tents. The eats on offer range from Wisconsin cheese curds to gourmet popcorn to, perhaps surprisingly, vegan \"beef\" brisket sandwiches. There's a carnival-like vibe here, with many people dressed in patriotic party wear. One of them is Edward X Young, an actor who has starred in dozens of budget horror films, and who tells me he's been to 79 of the former president's rallies. \"They've been a lot of fun, and I wear some goofy costumes,\" the New Jersey Republican says. \"What has changed [since the shooting] is that it's not that much fun anymore. Now it's deadly serious. We are fighting for our lives.\" The FBI is still investigating the shooting, including the motives driving the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks. Edward believes there's no need. \"Surely you don't need to have an investigation to realise he was inspired by Joe Biden's evil rhetoric,\" he says, pointing to Biden recently telling a donor phone call it was \"time to put Trump in a bullseye\". Biden has since conceded the language was a mistake. Edward says it shows how \"completely depraved\" the Democrats have become. \"All the temperature's been raised because of the Democrats,\" he says. At the entrance to Convention Fest, on one side of the road, salesmen peddle MAGA caps, mugshot T-shirts and stars-and-stripes teddies that are clad in their own Trump attire. On the other side, people are invited to sign their names on a big pink bus displaying anti-abortion, pro-Israel and \"she prays, she votes\" messages. At various times, groups of women stand beside the bus and pray. Together, it's symbolic of the combination of capitalism and Christianity that the Republican Party has long championed. \"Establishment\" capitalism has become something of a target now, with Trump and his running mate JD Vance promising to look after the American worker over Wall St. But there's still plenty of love here for God, who has been repeatedly thanked from the stage for the divine intervention that saved Trump from a sniper's bullets. \"I think God is with him, and I think he is godsent\" says Lynn Irving, a Hong Kong-born real estate agent who has also travelled here from New Jersey.  She took an interest in politics after her son joined the Marines, she says, becoming vocal on social media and running for town council. Friends in liberal Princeton have since \"defriended\" her because of her Republican leanings. \"It just says that they are not open-minded,\" she says. \"You may not like to date Trump, Trump may not be your guy, but his policies work. I want to go back to two-dollar-a-gallon gas.\" Not everyone here thinks the tone of political debate in the US needs to change. Among them is Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, a former newsreader whose attacks on the \"fake news\" and promotion of election-theft conspiracies have become signature. \"I believe that the tone has always been good,\" Lake told British podcaster Emily Maitlis. But she added the \"tone is disturbing when the media is calling a man like Donald Trump 'Hitler'\" (an apparent reference to reports about Vance once making that comparison). Later in the interview, after she was asked if she'd played a part in inflaming the rhetoric, Lake called Maitlis a \"sad case of a human being\" and told her she needed her head examined. Mick Pryor, a delegate from rural Wyoming, just wishes Americans would talk more. \"I don't know if it was before COVID or during COVID, but Americans just stopped talking to each other,\" he says. \"I think probably social distancing caused a lot of that, or at the very least accelerated it, and I think we lost a lot of the ability to see the other side.\" Despite the deep divisions beyond the convention, inside it, \"unity\" has largely been achieved. When Trump entered the arena eight years ago, the party was split, and opposition to his nomination was strong and on display. Now, many of those opponents have fallen behind him or fallen out of view. And there's a sense of strong confidence among attendees that the future is bright: another widely held view is that the Democrats are spiralling, Trump is ascending, and the shooting only made a MAGA victory inevitable. And that's what progress looks like to people like Mick, the Wyoming delegate. \"There was definitely a paradigm shift in the nature of the campaign [after the shooting], but while the assassination attempt was pivotal, I don't know if it was necessarily the most important thing,\" he says. \"I think that if you watch what happened at the convention last night, with a lot of very different voices talking about a lot of different things that all aligned around the same idea that, you know, we're a nation of Americans. I think it was extremely unifying. \"I think maybe we've scraped the bottom and are starting to bounce up again. And that's my hope.\" Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Political Parties and Movements US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Barack Obama has expressed concerns about his former vice-president's re-election prospects, joining former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  A growing number of Democrats are calling for Joe Biden to step down as the Democratic candidate in the 2024 presidential race. President Joe Biden was \"soul searching\" about dropping his Democratic re-election campaign, a source has said as multiple US media outlets report he has begun to accept that he may have to stand aside. After weeks of insisting that he will remain in the race, Mr Biden is now taking calls to step aside seriously and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, according to sources familiar with the matter. Follow live for all the latest news and updates from the Republican National Convention. Former president Barack Obama earlier privately expressed concerns to Democrats about Joe Biden's candidacy in the 2024 US presidential elections, according to US media reports. As the race to become president of the United States continues to heat up, members of the Democratic party fear for their leader, Joe Biden. Mr Obama has privately said that the sitting US president needs to consider the viability of his campaign, the Washington Post reported, but has also made clear that the decision is one the president needs to make. Mr Biden has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win the November 5 election and may have to drop out of the race, the New York Times reported on Thursday, local time, citing several people close to the president. The former president has taken calls in recent days from members of congressional leadership, Democratic governors and key donors to discuss their concerns about his former vice-president. Mr Biden said on Monday he hadn’t spoken to Mr Obama in a couple of weeks. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately warned Mr Biden that Democrats could lose the ability to seize control of the US Congress if he does not step away from the 2024 race, several people familiar with the matters told AP. Nancy Pelosi is reportedly one of the growing number of Democrats urging Joe Biden to hand over his candidacy. (Reuters: Leah Mills/File) Ms Pelosi also showed polling to Mr Biden that she argued shows he likely can't defeat Republican Donald Trump — though the former speaker countered on Thursday in a sharp statement that the \"feeding frenzy\" from anonymous sources \"misrepresents any conversations\" she may have had with the president. The 81-year-old president was isolating at his Delaware home after contracting COVID-19, with his doctor saying he was experiencing mild symptoms. With time racing, Ms Pelosi and Mr Obama are among Democrats at the highest levels who are making a critical push for Mr Biden to re-evaluate his re-election bid, as unease grows at the White House and within the campaign at a fraught moment for the president and his party. Montana senator Jon Tester called on the president not to seek another term on Thursday, saying in a statement he had \"never been afraid to stand up to [Biden] when he is wrong\". Some representatives say Mr Biden may now be more open to stepping aside. \"He's done what's best for America … I think he'll keep doing so,\" Democratic US Senator John Hickenlooper told Reuters news agency. \"He's working towards that.\" Mr Hickenlooper declined to say whether he believed Biden should step aside as a candidate. Major political donors, particularly in California, have been putting heavy pressure on the president's campaign and members of Congress, according to one Democratic strategist. Pressed about the reports that Mr Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, his deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said the president was \"not wavering on anything\". \"I do not want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times I can answer that,\" Mr Fulks told reporters. \"There are no plans being made to replace Biden on the ballot.\" Democratic leaders in the House and Senate — Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer — have told Biden directly that he will not only lose the White House but also endanger their effort to win back the House, according to reports in multiple news outlets. Both have spoken privately to the president in the last week to lay out their concerns, shared by many Democrats in the Capitol. Among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP research poll. Other opinion polls show four of the seven most competitive states looking increasingly out of reach for Biden. Biden wants to \"turn the temperature down\". But some MAGA supporters say it's about to be \"turned up to 1,000 Fahrenheit\". The Trump campaign, meanwhile, said it believes it is now competitive in Democratic-leaning states including Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Virginia. A planned virtual roll call will nominate the party's choice in early August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Control of the House and Senate is at stake, and leaders are keenly aware that a Republican sweep in November could launch Trump's agenda for years to come. On Wednesday, congressman Adam Schiff, a close ally of Ms Pelosi, called for Mr Biden to drop his re-election bid, saying he believes it's time to \"pass the torch\". Mr Schiff's announcement brings to nearly 20 the number of Democratic members of Congress calling on Mr Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. Mr Biden, in a radio interview taped just before he tested positive for COVID-19, dismissed the idea it was too late for him to recover politically, saying many people don't focus on the November election until September. \"All the talk about who's leading and where and how, is kind of, you know — everything so far between Trump and me has been basically even,\" he said.

The number of Democrats in congress who have publicly called on the president to drop out and let someone else take his place is steadily rising, with more than 30 so far. The president is in isolation with COVID-19, but says he looks forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week. Joe Biden is insistent on staying in the presidential race, despite a growing thrum of concern among senior Democrats who say he may not be able to defeat Donald Trump in the 2024 election. The president, who is isolating at home with COVID-19, released a statement following Mr Trump's address at the Republican National Convention. \"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump’s Project 2025 agenda, while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America,\" he said. His campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillion also spoke with MSNBC's morning show on Friday, local time, saying he is \"absolutely\" still in the race.  \"Absolutely the president's in this race,\" she said. \"Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.\" It comes at the end of a difficult week for the president, with a constant stream of Democrats publicly urging him to consider dropping out of the race, and endless reporting of leaks and anonymous sources citing serious concerns about him remaining at the top of the ticket.  Former president Barack Obama reportedly expressed concerns to allies in recent days, while former House speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told Mr Biden the party could lose control of the House of Representatives if he did not step away, according to several US media outlets.  As Joe Biden faces increasing calls to step aside from the presidential race, here are the Democrat voices speaking out against him so far. It follows reporting earlier in the week that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have both reached out to the president directly to discuss their concerns. Publicly, both are standing by their leader, with Mr Jeffries telling reporters today:  \"Right now, we’ve got the Biden-Harris ticket. We're going to support that ticket because the stakes are too high at this time.\" On Friday (local time), another two Democratic senators and 11 more House Democrats called on the president to end his re-election campaign.  More than 1 in 10 congressional Democrats have publicly called on Mr Biden to stand down — 33 in the House and four in the Senate.  Outside the party, new polling suggests 65 per cent of Democrat voters believe Mr Biden should withdraw and allow the party to select a different nominee.  The survey conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from July 11-15 — before last weekend's assassination attempt — found people believed Mr Trump was more capable of winning in November.   Ms O'Malley Dillion acknowledged there had been \"slippage\" in public support for the president, but maintained that there remain \"multiple paths forward\" for the Democrats to succeed with him at the helm. \"We have a lot of work to do to reassure the American people that yes he's old, but he can win,\" she said. Discussing recent public outreach, Ms O'Malley Dillion said the party had door-knocked around 100,000 voters across battleground states. She said the vast majority of those door-knocked told the campaign they were still supporting Mr Biden. \"They have questions, but they are staying with Joe Biden,\" she said. After weeks of sustained reports citing concerns among campaign and party sources, tensions appear to be at fever pitch. CNN reported on the mood inside the campaign, citing more than two dozen sources, one of whom described it as like being caught in a \"doom loop\". Another aide said: \"There's a growing sense that it's game over.\" Meanwhile, the New York Times is reporting that major donors have withdrawn their support from the Biden-Harris campaign.  Acknowledging it had been a tough several weeks inside the campaign, Ms O'Malley Dillion maintained that the party was united on the importance of defeating Mr Trump.  \"Every person believes that we have to defeat Donald Trump, we are united in that and we know how high the stakes are ... At the same time we also have to take seriously the concerns that people have,\" she said. If the president did decide to step down, the party would likely want to make sure that happens before it officially nominates its candidates at their national convention in August.  The same AP-NORC poll conducted last week found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Vice-President Kamala Harris would perform well in the top job. House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared a video with her 8 million Instagram followers late on Thursday local time, backing Mr Biden and saying that many of those who want him to drop out also want Ms Harris off the ticket. \"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave … that they will support Vice-President Harris, you would be mistaken,\" she said. \"People need to understand the reality and the gravity of what these people are proposing. \"I have not seen an alternative scenario that I feel will not set us up for enormous peril.\" She also heavily criticised members of Congress who have spoken to journalists off the record, saying, \"that's a bunch of horseshit\".   \"If that's your opinion, and that's what you think is best for the country, then put your name on it,\" she said. In a joint letter signed by some of the most recent House Democrats to go public, Representatives from California, Texas, Wisconsin and Illinois said it was time for the president to \"pass the torch to a new generation\".  Democratic Representatives Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia of Illinois, Marc Veasey of Texas, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Jared Huffman of California signed a joint letter asking Joe Biden to stand down from the election campaign. (Reuters: Jim Vondruska, Jim Young/AP: Morry Gash/Supplied) \"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardising what should be a winning campaign,\" they wrote.  \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Political Parties and Movements US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Look back through our blog to see how the day's events unfolded.   By Elissa Steedman This is where we'll leave our live coverage of Trump's rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Here's a quick recap of today: You can read more about the key takeaways from today's events in this piece by Lucy Sweeney below. By Elissa Steedman President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, this week moved to throw out his criminal conviction on gun charges and have a separate case accusing him of tax evasion dismissed. It follows a federal judge's decision on Monday to dismiss the criminal case accusing former president Donald Trump of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office. District Judge Aileen Cannon found the appointment of the special counsel, Jack Smith, in the case against Trump violated the US constitution because Congress had not given Smith the authority to pursue the case. \"The Attorney General relied upon the exact same authority to appoint the special counsel in both the Trump and Biden matters, and both appointments are invalid for the same reason,\" Biden's lawyers argued in a court filing. Biden was last month convicted in Delaware Federal Court of lying about his illegal drug use to buy a gun.  He's likely to have a more difficult time challenging the special counsel in his case because Cannon's ruling focused on Smith not being in the US government when he was appointed and had not been confirmed for the role by the Senate.  It's not the first time Biden has challenged the appointment of the special counsel, David Weiss, in cases against him but these efforts have been rejected by federal judges. Weiss is also leading a tax case against Biden that is scheduled to go to trial in September. Reporting with Reuters By Lucy Sweeney The Associated Press is reporting that the man who scaled a nearby building to shoot Donald Trump at last weekend's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, is believed to have flown a drone around the site ahead of time to scope things out. The drone has been recovered by the FBI, which is leading the investigation.  Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, fired multiple rounds from the roof of a building adjacent to the showgrounds where Trump was speaking. The existence of the drone could help explain why Crooks knew to fire from the point. The official who described the drone was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity.  By Elissa Steedman Donald Trump doesn’t think of himself as an extremist after praising Hannibal Lecter in his campaign speech. - John Grains The fictional cannibal has been name-dropped a few times in Donald Trump's recent speeches. He's even described the character as \"the late, great Hannibal Lecter\". So why is Trump talking about him? He's been making the reference when discussing immigration policy. Here's what he said in his Republican National Convention speech: \"They're coming from prisons, they're coming from jails, they're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. \"You know, the press is always on me because I say this. \"Has anyone seen Silence of the Lambs? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He'd love to have you for dinner. \"That's insane asylums — they're emptying out their insane asylums and terrorists are coming in at numbers we've never seen before.\" The southern border of the US is a hotly contested topic. There's no way of knowing exactly how many people cross the border illegally but American authorities counted more than two million unauthorised border crossings in 2023. However, claims by Republicans that undocumented migrants are responsible for a rising crime rate are considered false — research has suggested this population group has a substantially lower crime rate than US-born citizens. You can read more about the debate around the southern border below. By Elissa Steedman During his speech earlier, Trump revealed Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote to him following the assassination attempt at his Pennsylvania rally. \"I got along very well with President Xi. \"He’s a great guy — wrote me a beautiful note the other day when he heard about what happened and he wrote me a beautiful — most of the leaders did, you know — a lot of them didn't like what I was doing to them, but they also knew it was about time the jig was up. Right? It was about time. \"But they wrote me. Almost all of them wrote me notes.\" It's not the first time the former president has highlighted his \"good relationships\" with world leaders this week. Both today and at the Republican National Convention, Trump made note that it's a \"good thing\" he gets along with controversial leaders like Kim Jong Un. \"You were never in danger with me as your president,\" he said today. \"It's a good thing to get along, not a bad thing.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan A big question facing Democrats is who their candidate at this year's election should be, if Joe Biden withdraws from the race. While the president insists he's not going anywhere, there's already plenty of debate about whether the party should get behind vice-president Kamala Harris, or encourage other candidates to put themselves forward too. Dane Mullis, a social worker from North Carolina, was one of the people at the \"Pass the Torch\" rally outside the White House. He's registered as an independent voter, meaning he's not a member of either the Democratic or Republican parties. But he doesn't want to see Donald Trump returned to the White House, and he believes Democrats should have an open contest for the nomination. \"I refuse to believe that people in [Biden's] administration and in the White House have not seen this for years, the regressing in his old age,\" he told me. \"There's three months left, and it just shows that they should have been more proactive. \"Now they have the responsibility to pick someone else for the American people that's going to represent the American people.\" By Elissa Steedman  Donald Trump has wrapped up his speech at the Republican rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It ran for almost two hours and touched on some of the campaigns more popular policies, including trade with China, eradicating tax on tips and electric vehicle regulation. \"We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God,\" Trump said in closing. \"Together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\" If you're just tuning in,  ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland has explained some of the key moments. By Elissa Steedman One week on from the attempted assassination, Trump has adopted a jovial tone for his speech. The former president punctuated policy discussions with jokes at his own expense. At one point, he paused his speech to make note of his combover in a photo displayed on screens above the stage. \"That's a severe sucker. What’s with that one? \"I apologise. Man! I looked up there, I said, 'Whoa!' That’s like a work of art!\" Trump earlier quipped that he doesn't tip his barbers well because \"I don't think they do a very good job\". And while pulling an auto worker in the crowd up on stage, Trump noted \"he does not carry guns!\". It's a contrast from his speech at the Republican National Convention, which had a more sombre energy as he recounted the Pennsylvania rally attack. By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke We're heading towards the second hour of Trump speaking, and the energy in the crowd has noticeably dimmed. There's a steady stream of people leaving even as Trump continues speaking. Much of what he's saying does feel repetitive from what we heard in the first hour. Meanwhile outside, people who didn't make it into the stadium are gathered around phones to watch his speech. By Elissa Steedman Rogers has started his speech off by drawing a strong reaction from the crowd. \"Mr President, I want to say this as a former law enforcement guy: It wasn't that the bullet took you to the ground, it was the fact that you got back up for America.\" This line prompted chants of \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\". By Elissa Steedman Trump has brought two senate candidates for Michigan, Sandy Pensler and Mike Rogers, up on stage.  Pensler told the crowd he was ceasing his candidacy to make way for Rogers. \"President Trump endorsed Mike Rogers. Tonight, so am I.\" He told the crowd to enact Trump's policies, Republicans would \"need control of the Senate\". By Elissa Steedman Trump has told the crowd he's \"been indicted more than the legendary Alphonse Capone, Scarface\". The former president played down the list of charges against him, telling the crowd they're \"fake\". \"These are [by] a sick, weak, pathetic man who can't run an election, so he indicts his opponent, thinking that's going to win. \"Third-world countries do this a lot, banana republics do this a lot. \"We've never done it and we're going to teach them why they can never do it again.\" These comments led to Trump leading a straw poll on who won the presidential debate.  By Lucy Sweeney Hitting another of his favourite speech topics, Trump is now talking about what he describes as the radical left that have \"cheated\" and \"rigged\" systems to work against him. He mentions the \"big win\" he had in Florida this week, where a judge dismissed the criminal case that accused him of illegally retaining classified documents after he left the White House. He pivots into a spiel accusing Joe Biden's administration of mounting criminal cases against him and \"cheating\" in the 2020 election. It's a line that taps into his claims, which have repeatedly been debunked, that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" or \"rigged\". \"We're not going to allow them to rig the election in 2024,\" he says. He laughs talking about the indictments against him, describing them as \"fake indictments\" driven by \"a sick weak man who can't run an election\".  By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke One of the pre-set pieces was a declaration of \"No tax on tips\". When Trump vocalised the policy, the big screens inside arena spelled it out. The policy was first enunciated in Nevada a few weeks ago. It was seen at the time as a pitch to the large Latino population in that state, who staff many of the service jobs there. They've traditionally voted Democrat but Republicans believe they can be seduced over. Obviously the Trump campaign believes the no tax on tips policy also works for them in Michigan. By Elissa Steedman Trump has moved on to a mention of one of his most populist policies. \"I will cut taxes even further than we did before and that includes no tax on tips.\" He did take the opportunity to crack a joke, telling the crowd he doesn't tip his barber well because \"I don't think they do a very good job\". The former president also accused the Biden administration of harassing workers to pay tax on their tips, prompting boos from the crowd. \"It's like a big harassment operation. \"They hired 88,000 IRS people to go harass everybody.\" By Lucy Sweeney Trump seems to be spending a bit of time talking up his plans for manufacturing. The industry accounts for a significant portion of the state's total output, and employs about 14 per cent of the workforce in Michigan. \"When I'm back in the White House, the way they will sell their product in America is they will have to build it in America,\" he says, to a roaring crowd. By Lucy Sweeney Earlier in the week we saw the former president sporting a large white bandage over the ear that was shot. It sparked a bit of a craze at the Republican National Convention, with fans donning their own version of the new accessory. Today he's swapped it out for something a little smaller. By Elissa Steedman  An auto worker has been pulled up on stage mid-way through the former president's speech. Trump had been discussing his stance on electric cars (he says they're not for everyone) when he spotted the man in the crowd.  \"Oh there's the guy I stood up here yea—  are you the same guy, the same muscles — look at that guy! \"Are you the same guy? Yes? No kidding! Pretty good memory, right? Unlike somebody else who happens to be running again …\" Trump noted the man had spoken at a previous rally. The man took his moment at the microphone to encourage supporters to \"do our part\" in getting Trump elected. The former president then continued to discuss the cost of electric vehicle chargers. By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke  Despite saying his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention would be the only time he'd ever detail his experience of the attempted assassination because it was \"too painful\", Trump has repeatedly referred back to it already during this speech. He again explained that he only barely escaped death because he was turning to his right to look at a large sign, allowing the bullet to whizz past his ear. He jokes that he'll sleep with the sign tonight. The crowd seems to genuinely love hearing everything about the episode and he seems to be feeding off their interest. By Elissa Steedman Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, describing the organisation as the product of \"extreme\" conservatives. The think-tank has set out a controversial vision for another Trump term, which opponents have described as a threat to American democracy. Trump accused \"the other side\" of painting him as an extreme politician. \"I'm not, I'm a person with great common sense, I'm not an extremist at all.  \"Like, some on the right, the severe right, they've come up with this Project '25. I don't even know — I mean, some of them I know I know who they are but they're very, very conservative. \"They've come up with this Project '25 — I don't know what the hell it is, it's Project '25.  \"I don't know anything about it, I don't want to know anything about it.\" If you want to read more about Project 2025, here is a deep-dive by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson for Four Corners.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

We're here to walk you in,\" Cindy tells her. \"I like your shirt; very nice.\" Cindy is part of a team of volunteers — or what's called an \"escort\" — at the Camelback abortion clinic in suburban Phoenix, Arizona. She had an abortion when she was 17 and now, aged 70, has dedicated her life to helping other women access the same treatment. A woman is escorted outside the Arizona clinic.

People with anti-abortion signs outside the clinic. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) Four Corners travelled to the US in a bid to better understand the debate in the lead-up to the election in November — with the race between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump only intensifying. After years of legal challenges and confusion, there are fears that Trump may try to implement a nationwide ban on abortion if he is returned to the presidency. In April this year, Trump said he would not sign a national ban if re-elected to the White House, but Democratic Party pollster and political strategist Celinda Lake says many women still believe otherwise. \"We just had a really landmark tipping point where [55 per cent] of the voters now believe that [Trump] will sign a national ban,\" says Lake, who was one of the leading pollsters for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign. The Navigator Research survey of 1,000 people was released in May. The clinic in suburban Phoenix, Arizona. (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) Inside the clinic, Dr Atsuko Koyama is meeting a patient. \"Have you ever been in an abortion clinic before?\" she asks. \"No,\" says the young woman. \"Never had an abortion?\" \"No.\" \"So the state of Arizona does require you to wait 24 hours before I can hand you the first pill,\" Dr Koyama explains. \"The first pill is the one you drink here.\" A woman attending the clinic. (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) Today, a steady stream of women is coming through the front door. It's the state's busiest clinic. \"Our clinic does 30 per cent of the abortions in the state of Arizona, which is about 3,000 to 4,000 a year,\" Dr Koyama says. \"One in four people who have a uterus in this country have had an abortion.\" On the walls of the clinic are signs saying \"Do No Harm But Take No Shit\", and \"Uteruses Not Duderuses\". \"Women are not respected,\" Dr Koyama says. \"They need to continue to fight for the right to bodily autonomy and to keep government outside of the doctor-patient room.\" Atsuko Koyama is a physician at the clinic. (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) The staff here are used to being buffeted from all sides — not just by the vocal protesters outside, but by conservative politicians in Washington and by judges on the Supreme Court. Trump set in motion the tremors that would become an earthquake in reproductive rights. In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the five-decades-old Roe v Wade decision that gave women in the US a constitutional right to abortion. Three of the six justices who voted to overturn it were appointed by Trump while he was president — with him claiming he was \"proudly the person responsible\" for it. Since then, abortion has been banned in 14 Republican-led states, with limited exceptions. Staff at the clinic. (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) With Roe v Wade gone, Arizonans reverted to an abortion statute that was first enacted in 1864 — when Abraham Lincoln was president and the Civil War was raging. \"[The ban] was passed by 27 men before Arizona was even a state, at a time when America was at war over the right to own slaves, a time before women could even vote,\" said Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat. The rule, which would have come into effect this year, banned all abortions unless the life of the woman is in danger, with no other exceptions — not even for pregnancy caused by rape or incest. As we filmed inside the Camelback abortion clinic, Arizona's Senate gathered to debate the 1864 ban, with Dr Koyama watching on a laptop in the clinic's common room. The abortion ban being debated in Arizona's Senate. (Four Corners: Christopher Gillette) After a debate, it was overturned by a narrow 16-14 margin, meaning doctors can — at least for now — continue to perform abortions up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. \"It makes me relieved to know there are enough people who realise that an abortion ban from 160 years ago is ridiculous,\" Dr Koyama says. A Gallup poll this year found 85 per cent of Americans supported abortion under all or certain circumstances. Nevertheless, Dr Koyama remains nervous. \"I am very scared about November and the elections. If there is another Trump presidency, I do fear that we will get even more of our rights rolled back.\" A Planned Parenthood rally in Phoenix. (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) In February, Trump said, \"the Republican Party should always be on the side of the miracle of life …\" but when pushed to clarify his stance on abortion more recently, he said he believed policy on it should be decided at the individual state level. The Republican Party this month revised its long-held call for a national ban ahead of the election, saying it too wanted states to decide their own abortion limits. Trump's recently announced running mate, JD Vance, has previously expressed support for a national abortion limit, saying in May, \"I wanna save as many babies as possible,\" but this week, he too backed states to make their own policies. Biden has pledged to pass national abortion protections but needs control of both houses of Congress to do so, which he currently doesn't have. An employee at the abortion clinic. (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) Trump's stance could swing many voters away from him, pollster Lake says. \"Abortion is huge, and this is a deal breaker for a lot of women.\" It's also impacting their allies. Democrat Lupe Contreras is the minority leader in Arizona's House of Representatives. He voted to overturn the 1864 ban before it reached the Senate. \"If things come up to where it's going to affect my wife or my daughters in a way that could tear my family apart, how can I look in the mirror as a legislator and say I did the right thing by taking [their] rights away?\" he says. \"Who am I to say that?\" Democratic member of the Arizona House Lorena Austin said abortion rights mattered to people across the state and country and would drive them to turn out and vote. \"We are not trying to seek abortions frivolously … this is about medical health care and a patient and their provider, and their family's decision.\" As a first-time candidate in the US mid-terms in 2022, she said it was a key issue on voters' minds. \"When I knocked on the doors … people wanted to talk … about their freedom of medical decisions. And I think that's what it boils down to.\" Cindy and the team of abortion clinic \"escorts\". (Four Corners: Chris Gillette) Biden defeated Trump by just 0.3 per cent in Arizona at the 2020 election, and once again, it's expected to be a tight race in November. Outside the abortion clinic, Cindy explains the two choices as she sees them. \"[President Biden] is giving women the dignity of making their own decision,\" she says. \"Trump, not so much.\" Protester Lynn says she'll \"definitely\" be voting for Trump. \"I know he's 'pro-life', and recently he's kind of back-pedalled a little bit … but I think deep down, he is … the best candidate to carry out their values.\" Donald Trump did not respond to an interview request from Four Corners.

He used the speech to distance himself from the conservative group Project 2025, which aims to shape the policy of a second Trump presidency. In his first campaign rally since a shooter made an attempt on his life, Donald Trump has declared he \"took a bullet for democracy\". The Republican presidential candidate held an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, just seven days after surviving an assassination attempt at another rally in Pennsylvania.  He was joined by his newly minted running mate JD Vance, who along with Mr Trump was officially nominated by the party at this week's Republican National Convention (RNC).  JD Vance warmed up the crowd by saying: \"We had a hell of a four years with Presiednt Donald J Trump, didn't we? Are we ready to give him another four years?\" (Reuters: Tom Brenner) Supporters began lining up outside the Van Andel arena from 6am local time, forming lines that snaked around 10 city blocks. In an almost two-hour speech, Mr Trump revisited the attempt on his life, criticised President Joe Biden, and attempted to distance himself from \"extremists\" on the far-right. And he made his pitch to the voters of Michigan, a swing state that could be crucial to the outcome of the election.  In 2016, Mr Trump won the state by a slim margin of 10,000, Mr Biden flipped it back in 2020, winning 154,000 votes on his way to the presidency.   Taking a less sombre tone than in his acceptance speech at the RNC, Mr Trump spoke about the assassination attempt, again crediting a sign for saving his life. \"It was exactly one week ago, even to the hour, even to the minute,\" he began his speech. Mr Trump told his supporters on Thursday night (local time) that he would only recount what had happened once, as it was \"too painful\" to revisit.  He explained that in the seconds before a bullet grazed his ear, he had turned his head to the right to look at a chart titled \"illegal immigration into the US\".  In front of the Grand Rapids crowd, he brought up that chart again, declaring: \"I owe immigration my life.\" The crowd packed out the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (ABC News: Dan Sweetapple) Mr Trump went on to describe the conservative think tank Project 2025, which is aiming to shape the policy of a second Trump presidency, as a group on the \"severe right\" with \"radical\" ideas. \"I don't know what the hell it is. I don't know anything about it. I don't want to know anything about it,\" he said. \"[The other side] keep saying, 'he's a threat to democracy' I'm saying, 'What the hell did I do for democracy? Last week, I took a bullet for democracy.'\" Mr Trump also invited Michigan's Republican candidates for the Senate, Sandy Pensler and Mike Rogers, to the stage. Mr Pensler told the crowd he was ending his campaign bid to make way for Mr Rogers. Mr Rogers thanked his opponent and Mr Trump for their endorsement, telling the presidential candidate:   \"It wasn't that the bullet took you to the ground, it was the fact that you got back up for America.\" In a speech that returned to the typical tone of a Trump election rally, the former president took aim at the Biden administration and made jokes about the Democratic campaign.  At one point, he conducted a straw poll with his fans, asking them to cheer to indicate who they'd rather see him run against at the election in November. As Joe Biden faces increasing calls to step aside from the presidential race, here are the Democrat voices speaking out against him so far. At the mention of Vice-President Kamala Harris, the crowd booed, and then erupted into cheers when he asked if they'd like to see him run against Mr Biden.  It comes as pressure mounts on Mr Biden to drop out of the race and allow someone else to replace him at the top of the party's ticket. More than 30 congressional Democrats have spoken out publicly calling on Mr Biden to consider stepping aside.  Earlier today, a group called Pass the Torch held a rally outside the White House, urging Mr Biden to reconsider his candidacy. Protesters believe it is time for Mr Biden to step aside and let someone else take his place at the top of the ticket. (Reuters: Allison Bailey) Organisers say they have raised money from more than 350 donors, which has been used to air TV ads in Washington DC and Delaware, where the president is currently isolating with COVID-19.  Aaron Regunberg, a former state representative in Rhode Island who joined the Pass the Torch protest, told the ABC he believed Mr Biden should be replaced because Democrats \"are on track to lose right now\". \"President Biden has been a wonderful president, but he's not our best nominee to take on Trump, that has become very clear,\" he said. The president has indicated he's ready to return to the campaign trail next week after recovering from COVID-19.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, who competed with Mr Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, told NBC today the president had \"a really big decision to make\", adding that Vice-President Kamala Harris would be ready to serve if he did decide to step down. “What gives me a lot of hope right now is that, if President Biden decides to step back, we have Vice-President Kamala Harris who is ready to step up,\" she said.

America's oldest-ever president started out as one of its youngest senators, winning his seat just before his 30th birthday — the minimum age to enter. \"I expect these fellas are going to eventually judge me on my merit, not on my age,\" he said in a television interview shortly after his victory.  But more than half a century on, concerns about the 81-year-old's age — and his capacity to do the job — became too loud to ignore. \"It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your president,\" Biden wrote in a statement.  \"And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\" Perseverance in the face of adversity has been a hallmark of Mr Biden's political and personal life, and initially he'd remained defiant after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump. But less than four months out from the November election, the United States' 46th president will step aside for another Democrat to fight for the chance to become its 47th. When Mr Biden won his spot in the US Senate in 1972, he was a married father of three young children. \"The doors were just beginning to swing open on the rest of our lives,\" he wrote in his 2008 memoir, Promises to Keep. Within weeks, he would receive news that would change everything. Mr Biden was in Washington interviewing staff for his new office with his sister Val when she took a phone call that turned her face white. \"She's dead, isn't she,\" Mr Biden recalled asking his sister about his wife. In this 1972 photo, then-Senator Joe Biden holds his sons Beau (left) and Hunter. His wife Neilia Biden (centre) was killed in a car crash in December that year. (AP: File) Neilia Biden had been driving their children to buy a Christmas tree when their car was hit by a truck. She was killed, alongside their baby daughter Naomi, while sons Beau and Hunter were seriously injured. Mr Biden considered ending his federal political career before it had started. \"Delaware could always get another Senator, I told people, but the boys can't get another father,\" he wrote. But he was convinced by fellow Democrats to stay on, and took the oath of office by his son Beau's bedside. Barbara Perry, a presidential scholar at the University of Virginia, said the tragedy helped to make the future president the \"most empathetic politician imaginable\". \"Joe Biden, when people would speak to him about a tragedy, and he would commiserate with them, they knew that he had felt this horrible tragedy and pain,\" Ms Perry said. \"And so, he's become the expert — the consoler-in-chief.\" Two and a half years after losing his wife and daughter, Mr Biden met Jill Jacobs, an aspiring teacher studying English at the University of Delaware. In Mr Biden's re-telling, he proposed marriage multiple times before she agreed. He even offered her a deal — marry him and he'd leave the Senate. But she stopped him from doing so, saying: \"If I denied you your dream … I would not be marrying the man I fell in love with.\" Joe and Jill Biden have been married for almost 50 years. (AP: Evan Vucci) Despite the difficult start, Mr Biden proved to be a solid negotiator and legislator in the Senate, often seeking bipartisan consensus and compromise over the objections of his more progressive colleagues. He was well-liked on both sides of the political aisle but some contentious elements of his otherwise moderate 36-year record clung to him on the presidential campaign trail. As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he sat on for 17 years, Mr Biden oversaw the near-unanimous confirmations of justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. But his handling of the confirmation hearing of Justice Clarence Thomas in 1992 was far from smooth. Thomas was accused of sexually harassing his former colleague, Anita Hill, who reluctantly agreed to testify during the hearing. Hill, an African American law professor, faced a panel of white men and had her claims publicly dissected and sometimes outright dismissed. Joe Biden was first elected to the US Senate in 1972. (AP: File) Ahead of his 2020 presidential bid, Mr Biden expressed \"regret\" over the treatment she received, but never fully reconciled his role in it. \"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,'\" Professor Hill told the New York Times. \"I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.\" Mr Biden also faced ongoing criticism for sections of his 1994 crime law — considered to be one of his key legislative achievements. His opponents labelled the law overly punitive, arguing it led to the disproportionate incarceration of black men. But even some staunch objectors to the bill's \"tough on crime\" bent have acknowledged the merits of inclusions such as the Violence Against Women Act and a 10-year ban on the sale of some assault weapons. Mr Biden also voted to authorise his predecessor George W Bush's move to invade Iraq in 2002, though he later argued he was misled. More than 16 years on, as a frontrunner to win his party's presidential nomination, he claimed to have opposed the war from the \"moment it started\". The assertion was roundly rejected by his anti-war colleagues and fact-checkers alike. Mr Biden first ran for president ahead of the 1988 election, but his campaign sank due to a plagiarism scandal. \"I made some mistakes,\" he told reporters as he withdrew from the race. \"But now the exaggerated shadow of those mistakes has begun to obscure the essence of my candidacy and the essence of Joe Biden.\" Months later, he was in a hotel room in Pennsylvania after giving a speech when he woke up on the floor, fully clothed, with a \"rip of pain\" he'd never felt before. The-then-45-year-old was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. A priest was called to his hospital bed to give him the last rites. But surgeons were able to remove the aneurysm, as well as a second, smaller one, and he returned to the Senate later that year. Joe Biden, flanked by his wife Jill and daughter Ashley, met reporters right after he was released from hospital in May 1988. (AP: Adelle Starr) \"I had had a lot of time to think about my past and my future, and I wanted to be in the senate for years to come,\" he wrote. \"For good or ill, I was a public man.\" Two decades after his first attempt at running for president, Mr Biden tried again in 2008, ultimately losing to a rising star from a new generation of politicians, Barack Obama. Mr Biden went on to become Mr Obama's vice-president and, after a frosty start, the pair famously formed a close bond. \"This is an extraordinary man with an extraordinary career in public service,\" Mr Obama said while awarding Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017. \"Behind the scenes, Joe's candid, honest counsel has made me a better president and a better commander-in-chief.\" Joe Biden was vice-president under Barack Obama from 2009–2017. (AP: Ron Edmonds/File) Mr Biden decided to rule out another bid for the presidency in 2016 while grieving the loss of his son Beau, an Iraq veteran and former Delaware attorney-general who died of brain cancer. \"To lose his wife and baby daughter at such a young age in 1972 would have been enough for anyone for one lifetime, but then to lose his son Beau, in 2015, to brain cancer … He was the apple of his eye,\" Ms Perry said. \"He was what Joe Biden called 'the perfect Joe Biden' — if Joe Biden had perfected himself, he said it would be Beau. He called him Joe 2.0.\" It was Beau, Mr Biden said, who had urged him to stay involved in public life. \"He's the one who made me stay engaged, made me promise. 'Promise me Dad, promise me Dad,'\" he told NBC News. In 2020, he fulfilled that promise, taking on then-president Donald Trump. Mr Biden pointed to a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, during Trump's presidency, as a motivating factor in his decision to run. He campaigned on a promise to unite the country against a backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and a reckoning with racial violence following the murder of George Floyd. Mr Biden won with 81 million votes, more than any other US president in history — and more than 51 per cent of the total number cast. While Joe Biden was in office, Democrats held on to control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections despite what polling had suggested. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) But Trump falsely claimed the election was stolen, prompting a group of his supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 — the day Mr Biden's victory was to be certified. \"We have learned again that democracy is precious,\" Mr Biden told the crowd at his inauguration later that month. \"Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\" Mr Biden set about trying to move the US past the pandemic, even as COVID-19 continued to claim hundreds of thousands of lives. Inflation soared to its highest level in four decades, intensifying cost of living pressures that many Americans are still struggling with. And a historic surge in the number of migrants entering the US over its border with Mexico made immigration one of the top concerns for many voters. Mr Biden chalked up legislative victories on infrastructure spending and manufacturing, and successfully pushed for the most significant package of gun control laws in decades following the Uvalde school shooting. He chose Kamala Harris to be America's first female vice-president and nominated the first black woman to the US Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown-Jackson. Throughout his presidency, Joe Biden has reflected on the fragility of democracy. (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst) And when the court overturned Roe v Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion, Mr Biden made reproductive rights a major political focus. Democrats defied predictions of a so-called \"red wave\" to maintain control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.  And while they lost the House of Representatives, Republicans took control with a razor-thin margin. Trump's hand-picked candidates largely failed to deliver in the midterms, prompting questions about his ongoing influence. But he announced his 2024 candidacy soon after and went on to dominate the Republican primaries, easily securing enough support to become the party's presumptive nominee. Mr Biden had regularly pointed to his foreign policy experience on the campaign trail, both as a former vice-president and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But his approval ratings slumped after the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021. The pace of the fall of Kabul shocked US intelligence officials, as Taliban fighters swept through the capital and the government collapsed within days. The domestic political fallout for the Biden administration was swift and severe, with a Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee launching an investigation in the aftermath of the withdrawal. Joe Biden faced significant political pressure over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. (AP: David Goldman/File) Mr Biden promised to step up US engagement in the Indo-Pacific region in the face of China's increasing aggression, agreeing to the AUKUS deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, and strengthening ties with Pacific Island leaders. And he rallied the West in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, helping to expand the NATO alliance and pledging to support Kyiv for \"as long as it takes\". However as the war dragged on, support for Ukraine in Congress fell, and passing further financial aid became more difficult. Mr Biden also faced intense scrutiny over his support for Israel after Hamas' October 7 attacks sparked a months-long bombardment of Gaza. The president approved billions of dollars worth of military support for the country at the same time it deployed assistance for Gaza's worsening humanitarian crisis. Pro-Palestinian protests engulfed US college campuses, and Mr Biden's public appearances were regularly interrupted by demonstrators. Joe Biden travelled to Tel Aviv to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after the Gaza war started. (AP: Miriam Alster/Pool) He faced protest votes in some of his 2024 primary elections, with tens of thousands of people in the swing state of Michigan voting \"uncommitted\" rather than for the president. Without any serious challengers though, Mr Biden's path to the Democratic presidential nomination seemed to be in no doubt.  Republican control of the House of Representatives increased political pressure on the president, with the launch of an impeachment inquiry and probes into his son Hunter's foreign business dealings. Hunter Biden was also the subject of federal investigations which resulted in the now-54-year-old being charged with tax and firearms offences. His criminal trial on the gun charges earlier this year exposed damaging details about his drug addiction, and led to the first-ever conviction of a child of a sitting president. His father sought to sharpen his attack over another historic court case, after Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records in New York. Mr Biden started referring to Trump as a \"convicted felon\" and repeatedly criticised his handling of the January 6 attack, arguing he was not fit for the White House. But the president's own capacity to do the job came under increasing scrutiny, with concerns about his age — which had been aired since his 2020 campaign — taking on new urgency. Recent White House press briefings have been dominated by questions around Joe Biden's health and future. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Mr Biden has been open about a stutter he experienced as a child, recalling in his memoir that he spoke \"like Morse code. Dot-dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dash\". While he improved the stutter by reciting long poems in the mirror, he said earlier this year that he had \"struggled\" with it his whole life. The president has a long history of verbal slip-ups, and once described himself as a \"gaffe machine\". But not all of his stumbles could be easily explained. At a public event in 2022, he asked \"Where's Jackie\", appearing to forget that Republican representative Jackie Walorski had died the previous month. The White House argued he made the comment because she was \"top of mind\". Questions around Mr Biden's mental acuity also intensified after a federal prosecutor investigating his handling of classified documents wrote that he would likely present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\". The president called a snap press conference to hit back at the report, only to confuse the presidents of Egypt and Mexico. Mr Biden's physical fitness was also queried. Footage of the president falling on the stairs to Air Force One, and on stage at a graduation ceremony, were watched around the world. And he reportedly changed his routine around arriving at and leaving the White House to draw less attention to his \"halting and stiff gait\". However, the turning point came when Mr Biden faced off against Trump in their first debate of the 2024 campaign. The president's team had called for the unusually early showdown and spent days helping him to prepare at the Maryland retreat Camp David. Concerns in the Democratic Party were raised from the moment he walked out. Mr Biden spoke with a hoarse voice, appeared to stare blankly at times while Trump was speaking, and trailed off to the point where some of his answers did not make sense. Joe Biden tried to overcome doubts about his capacity after an underwhelming debate performance sent the Democrats into panic mode. (Reuters: Marco Bello) The White House blamed a cold, and then jet lag, with the president telling donors in the aftermath that he \"nearly fell asleep on stage\". He later conceded he had a bad night, but insisted he was still the best person for the job and would not withdraw from the race. The president hit out at what he called \"elites\" within the party calling for him to step aside, arguing Democratic voters had endorsed him overwhelmingly to be the candidate in the party's primary elections. Ultimately, though, the pressure on Mr Biden only increased.  As dozens of Democrats publicly called on him to step aside, the president was diagnosed with COVID-19 on July 18.  Isolated at his Delaware home, he decided to call time on his political career, although he insisted he would finish his presidential term.  He threw his endorsement behind his 59-year-old deputy Kamala Harris.  Mr Biden once suggested he'd serve as a \"bridge\" to a new generation of leaders, and his decision to seek another four years in office raised questions from the beginning. After so many years spent in public life, his legacy extends beyond his one term in the White House. But the timing of his exit, and the way in which he did so, could have a profound impact on the outcome of this election and who Americans choose to take over in 2025.

When she was sworn in as the US vice-president in 2021 she became the first woman, first black American and the first Indian American to take on the role. Before that, she was the first black woman to be elected as district attorney in the history of California, the first Indian American senator, and the first woman to be California's attorney-general. President Joe Biden has ended his re-election bid and has thrown his support behind Ms Harris to replace him as the Democrats' presidential nominee. She has declared her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination\".  Who is \"Momala\" Harris, the woman awkwardly asked to step in as America's mum? Kamala Harris was born in the US state of California in 1964.  She grew up in Oakland, near San Francisco, as the child of immigrants from Jamaica and India.  Her father Donald Harris was a professor at Stanford University. Her late mother Shyamala Gopalan was a biomedical scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Kamala Harris has credited her late mother Shyamala Gopalan for teaching her about the importance of political activism. (Credit: X (formerly Twitter)/ @KamalaHarris) Both of her parents were avid supporters of the civil rights movement sometimes taking a young Kamala Harris to protests in a pram. Ms Harris has spoken about her late mother's role in guiding her political ideas from those early days being taken to protests as a small child. \"My mother had been raised in a household where political activism and civic leadership came naturally,\" Ms Harris wrote in her book The Truths We Hold: An American Journey. Ms Harris was also a direct beneficiary of the civil rights movement.  She attended Thousand Oaks Elementary School in the second year the district used what became known as \"bussing\" to desegregate schools in the area. Kamala Harris shared this photo of herself on social media after challenging Joe Biden on his relationships with segregationist politicians in the Democratic primary debates in 2019. (Credit: X (formerly Twitter)/ @KamalaHarris) She and other black children from her neighbourhood travelled by bus to the more affluent and white North Berkeley school. In the Democratic Party debates in 2019, Ms Harris notably spoke about the experience. She challenged Mr Biden, who she was competing against to become the Democratic presidential nominee, after he described his political relationships with segregationists as \"civil\". \"It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing,\" Ms Harris said at the time. \"And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day.  \"And that little girl was me.\" Ms Harris graduated from Howard University in Washington DC, where she was part of a sorority.  She then studied at University of California Hastings College of Law, putting her legal degree to use as a prosecutor.  Ms Harris married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and became a stepmother to his two children Ella and Cole, who referred to her as \"Momala\".  Ms Harris has been clear. She isn't former US president Barack Obama in female form. Her relationship with Mr Obama dates back about two decades. During Mr Obama's presidential campaign back in 2008, she was the first notable Californian in public life to endorse him. While she was still running to be the Democratic nominee for the 2020 US election, she was asked if she would continue the legacy of Mr Obama. She responded plainly, \"I have my own legacy.\" Kamala Harris made history by becoming the first woman to be the attorney-general of the state of California, beating her opponent by less than a percentage point. (Reuters: Saul Loeb) That legacy began in 2003 when she ran for district attorney in San Francisco against the incumbent and her former boss Terence Hallinan. Her strategist at the time Jim Stearns told POLITICO her message on the campaign trail was simple. \"We're progressive, like Terence Hallinan, but we're competent like Terence Hallinan is not,\" he said. She won the election with about 56 per cent of the vote. Ms Harris later became California's attorney-general but that race was decided by less than one percentage point. When Kamala Harris became the US Vice President she broke barriers becoming not only the first woman VP but the first African American and Indian American to take on the role. Media reports at the time doubted her ability to win as a black woman who opposed the death penalty from liberal San Francisco. Her opponent Steve Cooley, a white Republican who was the district attorney for Los Angeles, described her views on criminal justice as \"radical\". \"I will not cede my law enforcement and crime fighting credentials to anyone,\" Ms Harris told Oakland's Fox affiliate KTVU in 2010. \"There are a whole lot of people spending a whole lot of time in state prison because of work I've personally done in the courtroom.\" But her time as California's attorney-general would later be used against her during her unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination. Some police accountability advocates have said during her tenure she did not effectively address police brutality, pointing to her decision as attorney-general not to investigate the police shootings of two black men in the mid-2010s. Kamala Harris dropped out early in the race to become the Democratic nominee for the 2020 US election citing a lack of funds. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) As the vice-president, Ms Harris is a strong contender to become the Democratic presidential nominee. The Australian National University's John Hart, who specialises in government and politics, described Ms Harris as a very capable politician with a strong electoral history dating back to her time as a district attorney. \"… I think there are a lot of people in the Democratic Party who would expect her to be the replacement,\" he said. \"[They] would be upset, offended if she were passed over for another candidate.\" But it wasn't smooth sailing for Ms Harris from the moment she was sworn in as vice-president. The right to an abortion in the United States comes from a landmark court decision made in the 1970s, known as the Roe v Wade case. The first few years were challenging, with Ms Harris facing dips in her approval ratings and even suggestions she might not make it to the US elections later this year. One poll conducted by USA Today in November 2021 had her approval rating around 28 per cent. \"In the early years of her vice-presidency, she was pretty much shut out by the Biden team,\" Dr Hart said.  \"I mean, she didn't have a very prominent role in the administration.\" But that quickly changed two years ago after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that recognised Americans' constitutional right to abortion and legalised it nationwide. \"Harris is strongly opposed to the Supreme Court decision two years ago … she is strongly in favour of a woman's right to choose, and she articulates the case very effectively,\" Dr Hart said. \"One of the things that makes her attractive as a potential presidential candidate is the abortion issue is clearly going to be a factor in this year's presidential election.\" Dr Hart said Ms Harris had been better at explaining the Democrats' position on abortion than any other possible presidential candidate that has been discussed. \"[She can] mobilise a lot of women, whether they're black or white, within the Democratic Party, to turn out and vote,\" he said. \"The key thing is mobilising Democrats to actually vote on polling day. \"And the more you see of her over the last year or so the more impressive I think she looks.\" Ms Harris is 59 years old. Born on October 20, she will turn 60 before the US presidential election.  Republican nominee Donald Trump is 78 years old. Mr Biden is 81 years old.  Americans will vote for their next president on Tuesday, November 5, local time.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

In a letter posted to social media, he said he believed it was in the best interest of his party and the country to stand down. Mr Biden has endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris, who says her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination\". Mr Biden said he would address the nation this week. Joe Biden has pulled out of the race for re-election to allow someone else to stand as the Democrats' candidate for US president.  Just four weeks before the party's national convention, where he was set to be confirmed as its candidate, Mr Biden has urged Democrats to back Vice-President Kamala Harris instead. The president, who is isolating at his Delaware beach home after a COVID diagnosis, announced the news in a letter posted to social media. \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" Mr Biden said. Joe Biden has quit the presidential race. Follow our live updates. He said he would give a public address this week. Mr Biden had been under sustained pressure from within his own party since his disastrous performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump. Whatever your politics, there was something truly heart-wrenching about the indignity of the last few weeks. But in dragging it out, Biden may have given his vice-president the best possible chance.  More than 35 congressional Democrats had publicly asked him to consider his candidacy and pass the torch. Polls have consistently shown large and growing numbers of Americans believe Mr Biden, 81, is too old for the job. Now, Democrats have a short window to choose a replacement, convince American voters that their nominee can handle the job, and beat Mr Trump in the November 5 election. In endorsing Ms Harris as his replacement, Mr Biden described making her his vice-president as \"the best decision I've made\". \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" Kamala Harris was campaigning at a North Carolina school on Thursday. (Reuters: ) Ms Harris said she would do everything in her power to unite the party behind her. \"With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,\" Ms Harris said in a statement. \"I am honoured to have the president's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. \"Over the past year, I have travelled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead.\" It is unclear whether other senior Democrats might challenge Ms Harris for the party's nomination. She is widely seen as the first pick for many party officials, but the party could choose to open the field for nominations. Joe Biden's withdrawal from the US presidential race has left Democrats in a precarious and chaotic position. Here's how the next few weeks could play out.  Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Mr Trump, and her ex-president husband Bill Clinton issued a joint statement endorsing Ms Harris and \"promising to do whatever we can to support her\".  Former president Barack Obama, whom Mr Biden served as vice-president, posted a statement praising the president as a \"patriot of the highest order\". His statement did not include an endorsement for a potential replacement. Democratic state governors Gavin Newsom (California), Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan) and JB Pritzker (Illinois) are among the other possible successors.  Mr Newsom has endorsed Ms Harris, tweeting that \"no-one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump's dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice-President\". Ms Whitmer and Mr Pritzker have meanwhile released statements praising Mr Biden's accomplishments but not endorsing an alternative, as have influential House Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates are set to be formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19-22. In a phone interview with CNN, Mr Trump claimed Mr Biden would go \"down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country\". He also predicted he would find it easier to defeat Ms Harris if she became the Democratic nominee.  A message of thanks was left outside the White House after the announcement. (Reuters: Kevin Mohatt) A later statement from the Trump-Vance campaign called for Mr Biden's immediate resignation from the presidency: \"Joe Biden cannot take himself out of a campaign for president because he is too mentally incompetent and still remain in the White House. Biden is a national security threat in great cognitive decline and a clear and present danger to every man, woman, and child in our country. \"The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months?\" Senior Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik also called on Mr Biden to quit. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Australian ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd both thanked Mr Biden for his service. \"The Australia-US Alliance has never been stronger with our shared commitment to democratic values, international security, economic prosperity and climate action for this and future generations,\" Mr Albanese wrote on X.

(AP: Melina Mara) After intense pressure from his party, US President Joe Biden has chosen not to contest the presidential election later this year. It makes him the first sitting American president since Lyndon B Johnson to choose not to run for re-election. After a shambolic debate performance, worries about Mr Biden's capacity to win another term became too loud to ignore. Mr Biden has had a long career in politics, having spent more than half a century in public life. He won his first elected position in 1970, becoming a councillor on the New Castle County Council in the state of Delaware. He then spent about 36 years in the US Senate, which saw him leave his mark on some of the biggest political moments in America over the past few decades. He ran for president unsuccessfully on two occasions, in 1988 and 2008, before he was chosen to be the vice-presidential nominee on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential ticket. After choosing not to run for president in 2016 following the death of his son Beau, he ran in 2020 and defeated incumbent president Donald Trump, leading to his return to the White House for what is now set to be a single term. Here's a look back at Joe Biden's career in pictures. Mr Biden celebrates with his first wife Neilia (right) and family after he was elected to the US Senate in 1972. Mr Biden almost left politics before being sworn into office after Neilia and their daughter Naomi died when their car collided with a truck. (Getty Images) In 1975, Mr Biden received criticism for sponsoring a bill that would have limited the power of courts to racially desegregate schools with \"bussing\". At the time, he described bussing as \"an asinine concept, the utility of which has never been proven to me\". This would later be used against him during his 2020 primary campaign. (AP: Henry Griffin) In 1987, Joe Biden announced he would seek the Democratic Party's nomination for the 1988 presidential election. But his campaign was short-lived, ending just months later following allegations he had plagiarised a speech by former British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.

Ms Harris said she intended to \"earn and win\" the nomination. Look back at how today's events unfolded in our live blog. By Nelli Saarinen Thanks for following our live coverage of the US election. Here are some of today's key events: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Nelli Saarinen Monday's newspapers are coming out of print and will soon be hitting stores in the US, with front pages dominated by Joe Biden's announcement he is withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race. Biden made his announcement on Sunday afternoon, local time, in Delaware. Here's how some of those covers are looking. By Nelli Saarinen The big question following Joe Biden's announcement that he is dropping out of the presidential race is whether the Democratic Party will unite behind Vice-President Kamala Harris, or if other contesters for the ticket will appear. \"Never before has a party switched horses this close to the election,\" ABC election analyst Casey Briggs said. \"There is a rule book for this sort of thing, but until now it's never had to be used.\" In the video below, Briggs walks us through what the next steps could look like for the Democrats. By North America Correspondent Carrington Clarke We're in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.  A popular seaside town that's currently packed with vacationers, many of whom are escaping the sticky heat of the nation's capital which is a two-and-half-hour drive away. There's a mixed response to the news of Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race from people on the boardwalk. Heather Babiarz says it's a \"sad day\". \"I think that most people, particularly Democrats, think of him as a man of valour, a man who is God honouring, who is decent and who fights for the underdog.\" She says she doesn't know really know Kamala Harris but is open to the idea of her leading the ticket, though she's also open to other candidates \"like Michelle Obama\". PJ Chestnut says he's not surprised Biden's chosen not to run: \"It's not really a shock to anybody. People have been talking about this for the past however many weeks.\" \"When you watch him speak on TV and in debates with Trump he's pretty much incoherent.\" He says he's a Republican and will be voting for Trump in November. His friend Cole says he's worried Biden dropping out is bad news for Trump. \"I think him against Biden, easy win for Trump. Now I don't know what they're gonna do,\" he says. Mona Redder says Biden is a massive figure in Delaware, where he served as a senator for decades: \"A lot of Delawareans have pride in how far he's come.\" But, she says, \"a lot of those same people would be glad to hear the news that he has stepped down.\" She personally doesn't believe he was fit to serve another four years. By Nelli Saarinen Joe Biden gave most of his aides a mere moment's notice of his decision to quit the presidential race after an agonising 48 hours poring over polling data which showed his path to victory was closing, two unnamed sources told Reuters. Only the day before, Biden was telling many aides that he would continue campaigning to defeat Donald Trump in November. In the words of one source, \"the message was proceed with everything, full speed ahead\". After digesting the polling data late on Saturday, Biden changed his mind. He gathered his senior White House and campaign team for a call shortly before 1:45pm on Sunday and moments later made his announcement public in a letter to all Americans. One source said top aides showed Biden internal polling with the jarring news that he was not just trailing in all six critical swing states that could decide the election, but also collapsing in places like Virginia and Minnesota where Democrats had not planned on needing to spend massive resources. Reporting with Reuters By Nelli Saarinen Joe Biden's decision not to contest this year's US election will bring to an end a decades-long political career. Biden won his seat in the US Senate just before his 30th birthday, making him one of its youngest senators at the time. But more than half a century on, concerns about the 81-year-old's age — and his capacity to do the job — became too loud to ignore, writes ABC North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan in Washington DC. Read the full story on Biden's decades-long career and legacy as a public servant below. By Caitlin Rawling UK musician Charli XCX's latest album Brat appears to be having a striking impact on Kamala Harris's campaign for the White House. The former official Biden-Harris campaign page on X has been rebranded, becoming the official campaign page for Harris's presidential campaign. The banner image of the page has been changed to match the colours of Charli XCX's recently released album Brat, which is neon green with black writing on it. Earlier today, the musician tweeted: \"Kamala is brat\" — a reference to a viral internet trend in which the word \"brat\" has been replaced by things that are cool and popular. After Charli XCX made the tweet, the official X page for Kamala Harris followed the musician, making her the only musician the page follows. By Caitlin Rawling The female vote is being seen as crucial to Kamala Harris's chances of beating Donald Trump in November's US election. Former Australian ambassador to the United States Arthur Sinodinos says Harris can provide a different line of attack on the Republicans. \"She becomes a lightning rod for a lot of women in America who are particularly angry with what's happened with Roe v Wade and particularly target JD Vance on this given some of his views on this,\" he told ABC radio \"There's a real potential for her to appeal to women across the country.\" By Nelli Saarinen ABC's North America correspondent Carrington Clarke is reporting from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where Joe Biden made the decision to drop out of the presidential race while recovering from COVID-19 in his holiday home. \"It seems pretty clear that when Joe Biden received that positive COVID test and had to isolate, he's come to Delaware and met with family, spoken to key advisers and made the determination that he just couldn't continue on,\" Clarke said. Biden has said that he will continue to serve as president until the end of his term, but has endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to run against Donald Trump in November. And now time is ticking to the Democratic National Convention in August. \"We are in completely unknown circumstances. The American political system is not designed to deal with this situation,\" Clarke said. \"The Democrats need to make a decision about how they will work this process, whether we'll see so many leading Democrats coalesce around Kamala Harris, that there is no other option, or whether it's an open convention where different candidates will vie for the delegates, which would be completely unusual, it would be historic, and it could potentially be very messy.\" Watch the full report below. By Nelli Saarinen The governor of Guam, Lou Leon Guerrero, has thanked President Joe Biden for his service and \"ongoing work to improve the lives of Americans\" across the United States. Guam is an unincorporated territory of the United States in Micronesia. \"President Biden is truly an honorable President, and we are thankful for his service to the nation,\" Guerrero said in a statement. \"Though he has chosen to withdraw his name from nomination, he has placed the country ahead of any other interest. \"The work to which he has committed his life will not end.\" By Anthony Furci Democratic political strategist and campaign adviser Na'ilah Amaru says she believes Kamala Harris would be an historic choice for the United States. \"She does represent what is often referred to as the growing 'minority majority',\" she said. \"The rising majority of the American population and the growing American electorate are black and brown women.\" \"Vice-President Kamala Harris is a more accurate reflection of the America of 2024, and the future of the Democratic Party.\" You can watch the full video here: By Nelli Saarinen While Kamala Harris has received many endorsements for the Democratic presidential nomination, including from President Joe Biden, her path to official candidateship is not yet a done deal. \"The decision, the power to pick the democratic nominee, is in the hands of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention,\" ABC election analyst Casey Briggs said. Some questions that remain unanswered include whether Harris will have any challengers, and if she will receive an endorsment from former president Barack Obama. Obama may be looking to use his endorsement to act as a unifying force within the Democratic Party at a later stage, Briggs said. Watch the full analysis below. By Maddy Morwood Here are some more photos from Washington, DC, earlier in the day. By Tavleen Singh Before Joe Biden, no incumbent eligible for another term had opted out of re-election for nearly half a century. Speaking on ABC News Breakfast, Time Magazine Washington correspondent Jay Newton-Small reflected on the historic moment. “You haven't seen a president really willingly give up power since 1968,\" she said. Lyndon Baines Johnson, known as LBJ, stepped aside in 1968 and said it was for the better of the country.  “I think that takes a lot of courage and it's really hard to leave that amount of power on the table and say for the next generation, 'I think it's best I step aside and let you have a shot.'\" By Maddy Morwood ActBlue has now announced that $US46.7million has been raised through grassroots supporters. Take a look at the exact moment Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 presidential race and the almost immediate impact it had on small-dollar Democratic donations on ActBlue. Bloomberg chief economist Michael McDonough has plotted the exact timing with donations.  It's pretty interesting. By Lucy Sweeney ABC's Gabrielle Flood has put together this handy flow chart. And Emilie Gramenz has put together an explainer stepping through that process in more detail. By Brad Ryan in Washington DC Kamala Harris has just received a major endorsement from all 57 state and territory Democratic parties. The \"vast majority\" of party leaders have voted to support Harris, the Association of State Democratic Committees says in a statement. None opposed backing Harris, but \"a handful\" abstained for \"procedural reasons\" in their states. The association's president, Ken Martin, said: \"I am proud that state party chairs, vice-chairs, and executive direcors across the country are overwhelmingly uniting behind Vice-President Kamala Harris. \"These state party leaders are on the front lines of winning elections at every level and know that the stakes of this election could not be higher. \"With our democracy on the ballot, there is no-one more qualified than Vice-President Harris to prosecute the case against Donald Trump.\" By Correspondent Kathryn Diss in Washington DC Things move fast in US politics. It hadn't even been an hour after Joe Biden called time on his presidential race that attack ads from the Trump campaign hit the airwaves in battleground states. \"Kamala knew Joe couldn't do the job, so she did it\", the ads reads. It blames her for the immigration crisis on the border, high inflation, for killing the American dream and accuses her of covering up Joe Biden's \"obvious mental decline\".   It matters because it shows the Trump camp was ready to attack the minute this news dropped. It also tells us how bitter and ugly this campaign is going to get. The ads are running in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, which both sides are desperately vying to win. By Lucy Sweeney It's been a busy morning (well, evening here in DC), so let's recap where the support is for Kamala Harris. The president endorsed his VP as the best person to replace him at the top of the ticket and run against Donald Trump at the election in November. So far, some big names have come out in support: Yet to speak out publicly in support for Harris are: We'll be keeping an eye out so watch this space. By Maddy Morwood Hollywood has been quick to react to the news of Joe Biden ending his bid for re-election and endorsing Kamala Harris. In the past few weeks, several high-profile celebrities had begun calling for Biden to exit the race. Most prolifically was life-long Democrat George Clooney, who delivered a scathing message against the president.  As news broke, many paid tribute to Biden's presidency, while others wondered about the future. Barbra Streisand, a Democratic supporter, wrote on social media platform X that \"we should be grateful for his upholding of our democracy\". Cher said she believed it was time to \"pass the baton\". Mark Hamill, who visited Biden in May and jokingly called him \"Joe-bi-Wan-Kenobi\", thanked the president for his service and his record of accomplishments. \"He restored honesty, dignity & integrity to the office after 4 years of lies, crime, scandal & chaos. Thank you for your service, Mr President. It's now our duty as patriotic Americans to elect the Democrat who will honor & further your legacy.\" George Takei threw his support behind Harris, while honouring Biden. Mark Ruffalo, who has been continually vocal against Trump, said everybody now had \"their marching orders\". \"No to Trump/Vance. No to the right-wing Christian religious takeover of our nation. Nothing wrong with Christianity; just shouldn't be running a nation birthed from freedom of religion.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Here are some of the key moments we covered: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Nelli Saarinen Kamala Harris's rise to the likely new presidential nominee of the Democratic party over the last few days has come accompanied with many viral memes. \"It's fun and has the potential to engage younger voters, but Harris's big laugh and sometimes quirky statements are also being exploited by Republicans,\" writes the ABC's North America correspondent Barbara Miller. Read the full analysis below. By Nelli Saarinen Kamala Harris's presidential campaign is likely to focus on the stark contrast between her and Donald Trump, says Dr Emma Shortis, a senior researcher at the Australia Institute. We earlier reported on Harris's first public appeareance since Joe Biden stood down from the race and endorsed her as the new Democratic candidate. \"It was remarkable that Harris was smiling and occasionally making jokes about Donald Trump, which suggests quite a shift in the tenor of the campaign,\" Dr Shortis told ABC News. The Trump campaign has fought hard to have the election be about Joe Biden 's age and his capacity, but now all of that focus will be on Trump, she said. \"Kamala Harris is a physical and policy contrast to Trump. The opportunity to flip that campaign is really significant for Harris,\" she said. Watch the full video below. By Nelli Saarinen Kamala Harris has become the Democratic party's presumptive nominee after enough delegates pledged their endorsment, her campaign says. Several state delegations met late Monday to confirm their support for Harris, including Texas and her home state of California. It was only 36 hours after President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris as his successor. Here are the latest numbers from an Associated Press tally: Delegates could still, technically, change their minds before the official vote in August, but nobody else received any votes in the AP survey. By Caitlin Rawling Kamala Harris says she has secured the broad support needed from her party to become the official Democratic nominee for the presidential election. Elections Analyst Casey Briggs tells News Channel, no one else has put their hand up to be the Democratic nominee, which is why Harris's chances of being selected as the nominee are so high. \"There is no other candidate. If another candidate were to put their hand up of course, they might change their mind,\" he said. When asked what the likelihood of someone else of putting their name forward and the delegates backing someone other than Harris, Briggs says it seems unlikely this would happen. \"The people that would be the likely challengers to her have said they're not putting their hands up and their endorsing Kamala Harris.\" You can watch the full analysis video here: By Nelli Saarinen  A Hollywood \"Dembargo\" on political donations has been lifted, as key fundraisers and celebrities endorsed Kamala Harris. \"Lost\" producer Damon Lindelof said he had halted what he called a \"Dembargo,\" a call for Hollywood backers to stop donating to Democrats after Biden's debate performance. \"Profound relief, gratitude … and then, for the first time, genuine EXCITEMENT for the election ahead\" Lindelof said in a post on Instagram. Disney heiress Abigail Disney, who had called on Biden to drop out, told CNBC she was resuming her donations to Democrats and that she thought Harris would be an excellent candidate. Harris, who would be the first black woman serve as US president if she wins, received support from several black women in Hollywood. Shonda Rhimes, the TV producer behind shows like Grey's Anatomy and Bridgerton, and actors Viola Davis and Sheryl Lee Ralph all voiced their endorsement and support. Black women are a key part of Harris's most devoted boosters, known collectively as the KHive, political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe told Reuters. \"Black women are the most loyal Democratic constituency right now,\" she said. \"And women are just revved up as hell.\" By Nelli Saarinen Kamala Harris has shared a statement saying she is \"proud\" to have secured the broad support of her party to become the Democratic nominee in the presidential election. \"Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top,\" she wrote. \"I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon.\" She said she was grateful to President Joe Biden and the Democratic party, and would spend the next months taking her case to the American people. \"I fully intend to unite our party, unite our nation, and defeat Donald Trump in November,\" she wrote. By Nelli Saarinen US Vice President Kamala Harris says she has secured broad support needed to become the Democratic Party's nominee for the upcoming presidential election. She made the comments late on Monday US time, Reuters reported. An AP survey earlier showed her having the support of 2,214 delegates, well beyond the simple majority of 1,976. However, the delegates are free to change their mind on their vote before the Democratic national convention in August. By Nelli Saarinen President Joe Biden is expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday at the White House, a US official said on Monday. Biden has been recovering from COVID-19 since last Wednesday but is returning to Washington on Tuesday from his beach house in Delaware. Netanyahu addresses a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday. Biden and Netanyahu are expected to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, as well as Iran and other topics. It will be Biden's first meeting with a foreign leader since he opted not to run for re-election and endorsed Kamala Harris as his successor as the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris is to meet Netanyahu this week separate to Biden. A Harris aide said she will stress to Netanyahu that it is time for the Gaza conflict to end in a way where \"Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.\" Reporting with Reuters By Maddy Morwood Circling back to brat — it's not the only internet trend surrounding Kamala Harris.  You may have also seen a bunch of memes about coconut trees, phrases like \"unburdened\" and \"the context in which you live\", and clips from a comedy series starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, writes the ABC's Jessica Riga.  The internet is a crazy thing. If you're having trouble keeping up, my colleague Jess has written this guide here: By Maddy Morwood ABC News Channel spoke to Washington Post political reporter Mariana Alfaro on the likelihood that Kamala Harris would be the Democratic nominee. Alfaro said that Democrats were \"falling back in line\" behind Harris.  \"There's still a process, and there a chance that someone else could jump in.  It is being reported now that the Democratic National Committee are opting against doing a big, open convention. They are going to nominate their candidate before the convention.\" The convention starts in Chicago on August 19.  Watch the full interview here: By Nelli Saarinen Kamala Harris has surpassed the number of delegates needed to claim the Democratic presidential nomination, according to unofficial surveys. According to an Associated Press tally, Harris had 2,214 delegates, well beyond the simple majority of 1,976 needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot. The survey is unofficial, AP said, as Democratic delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice when the party formally chooses its candidate. CNN also reported that Harris has enough endorsements from delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to its own estimates. She crossed the threshold on Monday night US time after a wave of support from state delegations. By Maddy Morwood Senior reporter for ABC NEWS Verify Matt Martino is speaking to ABC News Channel examining how old tropes, falsehoods, and misinformation are being used against Kamala Harris. Martino says: \"Ms Harris is a woman, and a woman of colour. One thing that we have been finding and have been tracking is this idea that she is the diversity pick, which seeks to sort of delegitimise her record, quite long and extensive record, of service in government, and minimise her to be some sort of quota girl who is only there to fill some sort of quota.\" Earlier, Elon Musk posted on X implying that the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros was pulling the strings of the Democratic Party. Martino explained how this was a \"throwback to a centuries-old trope\" that claim Jewish people secretly control the world. He talks about the effect that misinformation could have on Harris as a presidential campaign.  \"This idea that she is being pocketed or she is not eligible.. there is a certain section of the population that is going to be really receptive to that.\" Martino encourages people to proceed with caution and inherent skepticism while browsing on social media. \"When you're on social media and you see a claim, sort of stop and think, do your own searches about it and see if they are a reputable media.\" Watch the full interview here: By Caitlin Rawling The US Republican nominee for vice-president, JD Vance, says Kamala Harris is \"a million times worse than Joe Biden\". While speaking at a campaign rally in Virginia, Senator Vance says history will remember Joe Biden as a quitter and one of the worst US presidents.  \"But my friends, Kamala Harris is a million times worse and everybody knows it,\" he said. The crowd in Virginia cheered after he said this.  \"She signed up for every single one of Joe Biden's failures and his mental capacity to serve as president.\" By Nelli Saarinen As more senior Democrats throw their support behind Kamala Harris, speculation is already rife on who she will choose as her running mate. Watch the video below for a brief guide to some of the names that have been thrown around as options. These speculative VP candidates include: By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke More drama here in Rehoboth Beach with all phones being struck with an unnervingly loud warning siren and accompanying blunt message: \"TORNADO WARNING\". The house where Joe Biden is currently recovering from COVID was right in the middle of the concerned area. The relevant time has now passed and it doesn't appear that a tornado touched down in the area but it would be fascinating to know what security protocols were enacted by the Secret Service when the warning came through. Given all the mocking Biden endured for \"hiding in his basement in Delaware\" during the previous presidential campaign, this line seemed slightly poetic/ ironic. \"TAKE COVER NOW! Move to a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.\" By Lucy Sweeney When Kamala Harris became Joe Biden's running mate four years ago, she was the first Black, South Asian woman to accept a major party's nomination for vice-president. At the same time, she became \"the most derided woman in US politics\", according to a misinformation study. Our colleagues from the ABC NEWS Verify team have been tracking how old tropes, falsehoods and misinformation are again being weaponised against Harris. Their analysis provides a grim snapshot of what's to come as Harris shapes up as the presidential nominee for this year's election. Read more here.  By Maddy Morwood It's a \"brat\" summer — even for Kamala Harris. You may have seen us reporting in the blog yesterday that the former official Biden-Harris campaign page on X had been rebranded, with the banner image changed to match the colours and text of Charli XCX's recently released viral album, Brat.  But what is \"brat\"?  It is more than an album, more than a noun — it's a concept. In a TikTok interview, Charli XCX explained the essence of being a brat in simple terms: \"You're that girl who is a bit messy and loves to party and maybe says dumb things sometimes. She's honest, blunt and a little bit volatile. That's 'brat'.\" And the trend is sweeping the globe, particularly among the younger generation, who could prove essential to the outcome of November's election. Yesterday, Charli XCX tweeted: \"Kamala is brat\" — which quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of interactions.  Activist and co-founder of March for Our Lives movement David Hogg said Charli XCX's impact is \"not insignificant\" in a post on X. On Monday morning, local time, CNN's panelists were discussing the new campaign angle. \"So it's the idea that we're all kind of brat? Vice-President Harris is kind of brat?\" lead Washington anchor Jake Tapper said. \"The point is, whether it's her, or some very clever people that work for her, [are] going right for them [Gen Z] in the language of their own.\" By Lucy Sweeney If you've been deep in US politics news for a little while, the how-we-got-here perhaps feels like a bit of a blur. The momentum behind a movement to convince Joe Biden to step aside and let someone else contest the 2024 presidential election was swift, and things really came unglued at the disastrous debate on June 27. Former North America correspondent Kathryn Diss and our international digital editor Rebecca Armitage have charted the chaos that unfolded over the past few weeks. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan If Kamala Harris secures the Democratic nomination, she'll need a running mate. The vice-presidential pick is usually a strategic one, aimed at broadening a candidate's appeal among voters from particular backgrounds or geographical areas. Speculation around who could join a Harris ticket has so far centred on potential rivals for the nomination who were quick to endorse her bid. Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro is considered a rising star in the party and represents a swing state that could be critical to the Democrats' chances of winning the election. Former presidential candidate and now Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has a national profile and personal ties to another closely fought state, Michigan. While Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has found political success in a state otherwise dominated by Republicans. It's still early days, as Harris isn't yet guaranteed to be the nominee. But we can expect chatter around her potential VP pick to intensify in the days ahead.

Ms Harris still needs the votes of party delegates to secure the nomination in August.  Kamala Harris has used her first campaign stop since Joe Biden's US election withdrawal to compare her background as a criminal prosecutor to Donald Trump's trouble in the courts. The vice-president also said she is proud to have secured the broad support of her party to become the Democratic nominee in the presidential election. Speaking to campaign staff in Delaware, Ms Harris declared she was ready to put her record up against Trump's, in a likely preview of a campaign strategy to frame the contest as \"prosecutor vs felon\". \"I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,\" Ms Harris said – a reference to Trump's criminal conviction for falsifying business records and a civil finding where he was found liable for sexual abuse in a case brought by writer E Jean Carroll. \"So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type.\" Mr Biden, who remains in isolation with COVID, dialled into the event and urged campaign staff to embrace Ms Harris, who he has endorsed to take his place in the race. \"I know yesterday's news is surprising, and hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do,\" Mr Biden said. He said he planned to keep \"working like hell, both as a sitting president getting legislation passed, as well as in campaigning\". Ms Harris's potential serious challengers have all now endorsed her, easing fears of a messy fight for the top of the ticket less than four months from the November 5 election. Among her latest big-name backers is Nancy Pelosi, the influential former House speaker whose initial silence on Mr Biden's successor raised eyebrows in Washington. A day after the president's announcement, Ms Pelosi tweeted her endorsement of Ms Harris with \"immense pride and limitless optimism\". Three state governors — Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan), JB Pritzker (Illinois) and Andy Beshear (Kentucky) — quietened speculation about their own possible challenges for the candidacy by issuing endorsements for Ms Harris within minutes of each other. Mr Pritzker and Mr Beshear are now seen as potential running mates. But Ms Whitmer told a Michigan TV station she was \"not going anywhere\" when asked if she might join the ticket. Governors Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan), Andy Beshear (Kentucky) and JB Pritzker (Illinois) issued endorsements within minutes of each other. (Reuters: Leah Millis/Elizabeth Frantz/Bryan Woolston) Also in the wide field of Ms Harris's possible vice-presidential nominees are astronaut-turned-senator Mark Kelly, and Mr Biden's transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who built a strong supporter base when he sought the party's presidential nomination in 2020. While Ms Harris looks to have cleared the field of challengers to her placement at the top of the party's ticket, several key Democrats are yet to formally back her. Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, who lead the Democrats in the lower and upper houses of Congress respectively, are expected to meet with Ms Harris soon.  Neither has endorsed her, but Mr Jeffries said: \"Vice-President Kamala Harris has excited the community, she has excited the House Democratic Caucus, she is exciting the country.  \"And so I am looking forward to sitting down with her in person, in short order, with leader Schumer and we will have more to say about the path forward as soon as that meeting concludes.\" Joe Biden, who walked the halls of power for half a century, built a career on relationships. But in the end, it was his decision alone to do something no president had done before.  Former president Barack Obama is also still withholding his endorsement after saying he had \"confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges\". Big donors have continued to back the vice-president with big money. One pro-Democrats political fundraising committee, the Future Forward group, received $US150 million ($226 million) in new commitments, an aide told Politico. That revelation followed what one party strategist said \"might be the greatest fundraising moment in Democratic Party history\", when donations massively spiked in the hours after Mr Biden's announcement.  The Harris campaign later announced it had raised $US81 million in 24 hours, almost doubling a war chest that had reached $US96 million at the end of June. Kamala Harris made her first public appearance since Joe Biden stepped back to endorse her as presidential candidate, in an event with college athletes at the White House. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) Earlier on Monday, at an event at the White House, Ms Harris gave her first public remarks since Mr Biden's announcement, praising his legacy as \"unmatched in modern history\".  \"In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" she said. She did not specifically mention her own campaign for the presidency. The Trump campaign and its supporter groups have meanwhile begun painting Ms Harris as a more left-wing choice than Biden.  Campaign ads and emails attack her as complicit in a cover-up of Mr Biden's decline, a failure as his \"border tsar\" tasked with securing the US-Mexico border, and a \"weak-on-crime prosecutor\" when she was San Francisco's district attorney between 2004-2010.

Nixon resigned in disgrace. JFK and Lincoln were shot. Harrison caught a chill at his inauguration and died a month later. LBJ simply decided not to run again. But no-one has launched a bid for a second term in office, handily won the nomination, and then been so swiftly abandoned by their own party that they had no choice but to step out of the way. The political momentum pushing him out of office became too much as Democrat after Democrat in the House and Senate joined the growing chorus. Despite vowing to return to the campaign trail in the last few days, by Sunday afternoon local time, Mr Biden was out. Many of his own staff, including some of his closest advisers, were reportedly only given a few minutes' notice before his decision was announced to the world. \"It's been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your president,\" he said in a statement. \"And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\" Joe Biden's 2024 ambitions were dashed in the first 10 minutes of his calamitous debate against Donald Trump. What followed was three weeks of chaos — shaky TV interviews, a Hollywood actor's defection, a near-assassination attempt on his rival, and an extraordinarily inconvenient COVID-19 diagnosis. All of it only piled the pressure on Mr Biden's shoulders. And as more and more senior Democrats turned, it was friends from Mr Biden's halcyon days in the US Senate and Obama's White House that finally convinced him it was over. Is there anything more brutal in US politics than the presidential debate? The modern equivalent of gladiator combat, presidential hopefuls march into the arena hoping for one good viral moment but risking humiliation, fumbles, and the decisive thumbs-down of the American electorate. Richard Nixon may have cost himself the 1960 election when he showed up looking pale and sweaty. Then-Texas-governor Rick Perry watched his own ambitions evaporate before his eyes in 2011 when he declared that as president, he intended to cut three government agencies, but failed to recall exactly which ones. \"Oops,\" he shrugged after an excruciating few moments during which his rivals attempted to help him remember. But when Mr Biden faced off against Trump on June 27, he put in what was described as \"the worst debate performance in American history\". At times whisper-soft, Mr Biden rambled through some answers, stammered and stumbled, occasionally lost his train of thought and, worst of all, failed to deliver a single blow against his opponent. \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence, and I don't think he did, either,\" Trump declared when asked if he'd like to respond to Mr Biden's incomprehensible answer on immigration. Joe Biden was roundly criticised for his performance in a debate against Donald Trump. \n\n  (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Mr Biden had rolled the dice on a pre-conventions debate, hoping it would allay concerns about his advanced age. Instead it turned whispers in DC's halls of power to a deafening roar. For months, there has been speculation that Mr Biden is a \"well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" who has good days and bad days. The 81-year-old, who is open about the challenges of living with a stutter, has insisted that while his speech is sometimes impeded, his age makes him a better president. \"I'm elderly and know what the hell I'm doing,\" Mr Biden said in February. But as soon as he opened his mouth on the debate stage, a Democratic rebellion against his leadership began in earnest. It was supposed to ease concerns about his mental and physical fitness, but instead Joe Biden's debate performance only enhanced them. Now, the pressure on the president to pull out of the election race is intensifying. \"I know how this felt tonight: it felt like a gut punch,\" former Missouri senator Claire McCaskill said. \"President Biden can't win. This debate is a nail in the political coffin,\" an unnamed Democratic strategist told NBC. The Democratic Convention, during which the presidential candidate and their running mate are formally confirmed as the nominees, is set down for August 19. But a quirk of this election cycle meant that Democrats intended to hold a \"virtual roll call\" two weeks earlier to ensure Mr Biden and Ms Harris could legally appear on the ballot in Ohio. Those who wanted Mr Biden gone knew they had to act fast. The only problem? America's modern political system contains no obvious mechanism to strip him of the nomination. That left Democrats just weeks to convince the most powerful man in the world to give up the job he spent his entire adult life trying to win, one he had long believed to be his destiny. Both Mr Biden and the Democrats who wanted him gone knew the clock was ticking. \"He will not be dragged off the stage,\" an unnamed official told Axios, which quickly became the media outlet of choice for panicked Democrats to voice their concerns anonymously. \"The goal is to let him walk off the stage.\" But Mr Biden, who ran for the presidency three times over three decades before finally winning in 2020, did not want to be ushered out of the spotlight just yet. \"I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job, because quite frankly the stakes are too high,\" he said at a rally in North Carolina the day after the debate. Joe Biden told supporters that age may have slowed him down physically, but he still believed himself to be the best Democrat to beat Trump.  (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) During a high-stakes interview with George Stephanopoulos a week later, he was asked how he would feel if he lost the White House to Trump. \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do, that's what this is about,\" he said, to the alarm of Democrats. Famous for his strong bonds with members of Congress, his love of negotiation, and his eagerness to pick up the phone for a chat, Mr Biden suddenly went quiet. Instead he sent a letter to congressional Democrats telling them it was time to fall in line. And in a phone interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, he railed against \"party elites\" who he said were trying to undo the will of the people. Mr Biden was not just losing members of his own party. He was losing celebrities as well.  Key Democratic fundraiser and actor George Clooney wrote a devastating column in The New York Times in which he declared: \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\"  Biden officials reportedly spent days pleading with the star not to go ahead with his opinion piece, but to no avail.  On July 11, Mr Biden held a press conference designed in part to showcase his foreign policy chops, but misspoke several times, introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Putin, and accidentally referring to Trump as his vice-president. During a press conference, Joe Biden accidentally introduced Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\".  (AP: Susan Walsh) Mr Biden has always been famously bad with names and prone to verbal gaffes. There was a time when his unpredictability and \"Uncle Joe\" persona were part of the Biden political brand. But as some national polls suggested Trump edging ahead of Mr Biden, he had no room to manoeuvre. A series of conference calls with congressional Democrats did little to quell the rebellion, with one meeting on July 14 described by some participants as \"tense\", \"awful\" and a \"complete disaster\". The call went so badly that several Democrats were prepared to go public with their stance that Mr Biden needed to go, according to ABC America. But just hours later, a bullet sailed across a field in Pennsylvania, tearing a bloody gash in Trump's ear, horrifying Americans, and up-ending the 2024 presidential race. The moment he collapsed on the ground lasted only a few seconds. But as a hush fell over his rally and a wounded Trump was hidden beneath a pile of burly Secret Service agents, it seemed to stretch out interminably. Donald Trump was injured by a would-be assassin during a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. \n\n \n\n\n  (AP: Evan Vucci) Then he arose, bloody but defiant, urging his supporters to \"fight\". That famous image of Trump standing up with his fist pumping the air just seconds after narrowly escaping death became a split-screen moment contrasted with a string of shaky Biden performances. Everyone could see that the near-miss of an assassin's bullet had dramatically changed the race, but no-one could quite agree how.  I went to the Trump rally in Pennsylvania to see his campaign in action. I can viscerally recall the moment I realised there was a live possibility I could be shot at any second in an open field. Some foreign diplomats told Politico they believed the shooting had only improved Trump's chances in November.  \"We've all resigned ourselves to a second Trump presidency,\" an unnamed senior Democrat told Axios on July 14. In a country where four presidents have been assassinated, the moment was a delicate one for Mr Biden.  He suspended attack ads, called for calm, and continued his speaking engagements to prove he was up for the job. The incident also seemed to have a chilling effect on the Democratic rebellion against Mr Biden's candidacy.  \"An American is dead, a former president and others are wounded, and a shell-shocked country is left wondering how to restore reason and respect,\" Congressman Dean Phillips said. \"It would be unpatriotic and unprincipled to direct energy to anything other than yesterday's national tragedy.\" But the reprieve for Mr Biden was short-lived.  On July 16, reports emerged that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) might move up its virtual roll call to confirm Mr Biden as the nominee weeks earlier than anyone anticipated. Democrats who wanted him off the ticket were outraged.  \"All of us … agree that stifling debate and prematurely shutting down any possible change in the Democratic ticket through an unnecessary and unprecedented 'virtual roll call' in the days ahead is a terrible idea,\" they wrote in a letter to the DNC. While dozens of Democrats had already gone public with their call for Mr Biden to quit the race, one voice rose above the others.  Congressman Adam Schiff, the most senior Democrat to speak out so far, said on July 17 that it was time for Mr Biden to \"pass the torch\". The statement spelled doom to Mr Biden's allies.  Nancy Pelosi is believed to have played a key role in convincing Joe Biden it was time to go.  (Reuters: Tim Sloan) Mr Schiff's mentor is Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker and party elder, who is perhaps the most powerful woman in the Democratic Party.  \"Nancy is all over this,\" a White House source told Reuters. \"She doesn't miss. Schiff wouldn't move without her approval.\"  On the campaign trail in Nevada with a worsening cough and fever, Mr Biden tried to crack a little joke.  \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,\" he said, quoting former US president Harry Truman. \"After the last couple of weeks, I know what he means.\"  Amid reports he felt abandoned and resentful towards the people he once considered his closest friends and allies, Mr Biden's luck went from bad to worse.  He tested positive to COVID-19.  Retreating to his picturesque beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Mr Biden could do little as his support crumbled.  House Majority Leader Democrat Chuck Schumer reportedly had a blunt one-on-one conversation with the president during which he forcefully made the case for him to bow out of the race. One internal poll obtained by The Wall Street Journal suggested an electoral wipe-out for Mr Biden, one which would see him losing not only the crucial swing states, but New Hampshire, Virginia and Maine as well.  In a tense phone call with Ms Pelosi, Mr Biden insisted he had other data showing a path to victory.  \"Put Donilon on the phone,\" she reportedly shot back, referring to Mike Donilon, the president's longtime aide.  \"Show me what polls.\" Barack Obama remained publicly silent on Joe Biden's situation, but US media reported he was concerned about his 2024 chances.  (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Mr Biden's former boss Barack Obama, with whom he has a complicated but loving bond, was mostly silent throughout the past chaotic few weeks.  But Mr Biden reportedly become suspicious that Mr Obama was operating in the shadows to shuffle him out of the spotlight, adding what The New York Times called a \"Shakespearean quality to the drama playing out\". But Mr Biden, who has walked the halls of power for more than half a century, is a politician who built a career on relationships and negotiation.  \"I believe all politics is personal,\" he wrote in his memoir Promise Me, Dad.  \"Because at bottom, politics depends on trust, and unless you can establish a personal relationship, it’s awfully hard to build trust.\"  Mr Biden recognised that he no longer had the trust of his party to win against Trump.  After talking to his family, he called his closest advisers and told them he had a statement to write.  He was done.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:World Politics Topic:World Politics Analysis by Barbara Miller US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Jim Chilton doesn't look like someone who could stand up to the blood-soaked brutality of the notorious Mexican drug cartels. He's 85, and there's only one of him. All he's packing is an old bolt-action rifle and a handgun. But the veteran cattle rancher has plenty of Arizona grit. \"I'm a cowboy, not a wimp,\" Jim says. \"It's outrageous to have foreigners sitting on your mountains, on your ranch. It's just outrageous.\" The cartels come and go on Jim's southern Arizona ranch like they own the place. It's not just drugs — heroin, cocaine, marijuana and fentanyl — that they're bringing through the Arizona border. Now one of their most lucrative businesses is human beings. We are bumping along in Jim's pick-up, heading south through his property to where it borders with Mexico. He wants to show me the trails used by the cartels to smuggle drugs and migrants that spider web through his property. This business is so lucrative there have been gun battles between rival cartels for control of the trails. He's been warned we're in dangerous territory — the US Border Patrol has told Jim to avoid this area. But Jim won't let the cartels dictate where he can and can't go. The veteran cowboy points to a nearby mountaintop. \"All of these mountains have cartel spotters. Their objective is to be a scout looking for the Border Patrol,\" he says. \"The cartel scouts are undoubtedly watching us. They see us coming and they're trying to evaluate who we are.\" After two hours of spine-rattling tracks, we arrive at the spot Jim wants to show me. It's the border, and Donald Trump's great wall. Rust red, the 9-metre-high steel bollard wall snakes along the boundary between Mexico and Jim's ranch. Then it stops. \"I have five miles of the wall. And then on January 21st, 2021, Biden took office and then stopped all construction,\" Jim says. Where Trump's wall ends on Jim's ranch you can simply walk across the border. This is now one of the gateways being used by thousands of undocumented migrants to get into the US. \"It's been an open door for people coming through. The druggers as well as the economic migrants,\" Jim says. This is more than an unfinished wall. It's the centre of a political battle that will shape the presidential election. It's a monument to Donald Trump's chaotic presidency, an unrealised grandiose vision. And it's a stark reminder of one of the Biden administration's political weaknesses — many Americans believe it has lost control of the border. Anger over the ceaseless flow of asylum seekers has prompted some to take the law into their own hands. \"Under our constitution, the government's supposed to protect you. If the government can't protect you, you can protect yourself,\" Tim Foley says. \"This is no-man's-land. This is where the bad guys are.\" An army veteran, Foley leads Arizona Border Recon, a group of armed volunteers that aims to disrupt people smuggling. Today, with Jim Chilton's permission, they are on his ranch patrolling along the border. Some call Foley and his followers vigilantes. \"I've been called everything in the book,\" Foley says. \"But on the back of my neck, I got a tattoo. It says D-I-L-L-I-G-A-F, which stands for, 'Does it look like I give a f***.' And I don't give a f*** what people think about me, because I know who I am and what I stand for.\" Foley's radio crackles into life. It's a report back from one of his patrol members who's spotting immigrants walking into the United States from Mexico. \"Coming over this morning there's 500,\" Foley says. \"He said he knows it was more than 500.\" Franco and Jenny crossed into the US this morning. They're from Peru, a country that has been engulfed in protests and political violence for almost two years. Their journey was long and dangerous. There have been reports that women and girls have been raped by Mexican cartel members. \"For a woman, yes, it was very risky,\" says 21-year-old Jenny, who was a traditional dancer back in Peru. \"I travelled easily from Peru by plane. But from Mexico it was travelling in the back of a truck … we travelled for a day without eating, we also couldn't go to the toilet. We got to a warehouse and then from the warehouse we had 15 hours travelling … all cramped up with 15 people alone in a trailer.\" \"Sometimes it was very hot, I couldn't breathe properly,\" Franco says. \"There were many days where you couldn't sleep … you were afraid, hungry, thirsty.\" Jenny says many of the asylum seekers were terrified of the people smugglers. \"They kidnap, they demand money. Luckily, thank God, none of that happened,\" Jenny says. Over the next couple of hours, the trickle of migrants walking around the end of the wall into the US becomes a stream. There are people from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and even Bangladesh and India. One man is from Senegal in Africa. It's almost 40 degrees Celsius, and they have been walking for hours. \"Hungry, thirsty,\" says one man in Spanish, who asks us for water. \"It's very hot since 8 o'clock this morning.\" The pursuit of the American dream can be deadly. Over the years, Jim Chilton has made many terrible discoveries on his ranch. \"Since the 1990s, I've had an estimated 35 people die on the ranch,\" he says. \"I suspect that it's lack of water, getting lost, no food or sometimes they are injured … if they break a leg or get a bad ankle, the group just leaves 'em.\" Jim has installed 29 drinking fountains on the southern section of his ranch for people who've crossed the border to use. \"People can get a drink and fill up their water bottle, and go on. I'm sure I've prevented a lot of deaths due to lack of water.\" Once the immigrants walk into Jim Chilton's ranch, most head west along a road that hugs the wall, hoping to be picked up by the United States Border Patrol and processed. But often, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed. \"This morning there were two groups that crossed the end of the border wall about seven miles east of here,\" says Andy Winter, who's running a camp providing shelter, food and water. \"They started walking this way. So when I arrived at 6:15, 6:30am, there were 202 people exactly. Walking down the road from the end towards here, with babies, old people, women, children, families.\" Around us, exhausted people sleep on wooden pallets set up under open tents. Others help themselves to water, coffee or hot food provided by Andy and his volunteer group. \"No-one would choose to do this unless they felt like there was no other option at all,\" Andy says. \"Many don't make it. It's brutal. It's just terrifying.\" As he ramps up his campaign to regain the presidency, Donald Trump has increased his inflammatory and dehumanising rhetoric towards undocumented immigrants like these. He has said that they are coming in by the millions from foreign insane asylums and prisons, and are engaged in the \"plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of the American suburbs, cities, and towns\". \"Trump is Trump. He tells it like he thinks it is, and he not a politician in the sense that he gives mealy mouthed words and comments,\" says Jim Chilton, who appeared onstage with Trump at a farmers' conference in 2019. Of the nearly 8 million people stopped at the border since 2021, about 100,000 — just over 1 per cent — were convicted criminals, according to US government figures. Around 2,000 were identified as gang members. The former president's political opponents have accused him of using Hitler-esque language to demonise vulnerable people. \"They're poisoning the blood of our country,\" Trump said this year. \"The Democrats say, 'Please don't call them animals. They're humans.' I said, 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals.'\" Tim Foley and others warn that among the many seeking the American dream are those who want to destroy it. \"How many of these guys that you don't know about coming across are terrorists?\" Foley says. \"How many cells do we have sitting in this country right now just waiting for word?\" This year, eight Tajiks with alleged ties to ISIS reportedly crossed over the southern border before being arrested. Democrat Lupe Contreras is the minority leader in Arizona's House of Representatives, and a proud Mexican American. He says Trump's rhetoric has hurt many in his community, and beyond. \"It's divided our country.\" \"My dad came to this country when he was 12 years old. I am a son of a migrant. My dad's worked his butt off his whole life. My grandpa worked to the day that he became a citizen. He worked his whole life. \"They never asked for anything from this country. All they wanted is respect.\" Andy Winter says the people he meets at the border are \"amazing, beautiful, strong people who are determined to try and stay alive and provide for their families\". \"When I hear Trump say the crazy things he says about this 'invasion', and they're sending their rapists and their murderers and they're emptying their prisons, I mean, all you have to do is spend a half hour with these people and you realise like in a heartbeat, you'd take them as neighbours.\" The contest in Arizona is expected to be tight this November. In 2020, Joe Biden defeated Trump in the state by just 0.3 per cent of the vote. Even senior congressional Democrats acknowledge the border is a big problem for the administration. \"The immigration system has broken down,\" veteran Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren says. \"The asylum system is no longer working as intended. People who are not genuine [asylum seekers] are admitted because the law needs reform. \"But all the statistics show that the vast majority of people who are coming are coming to better their lives to work, to have hope for their family.\" Republicans and Democrats last year achieved what seemed like a political impossibility – they reached an agreement with a bipartisan bill to address the crisis at the border. The bill would have enabled the administration to deport migrants who cross into the United States between ports of entry without permitting them to apply for asylum. But that political unity spelled electoral danger for Donald Trump, so in a sign of his control over the Republican Party, he intervened to kill the bill. \"A lot of the senators are trying to say, respectfully, they're blaming it on me. I say, 'That's OK. Please blame it on me. Please. Because they were getting ready to pass a very bad bill,'\" Trump said. In response to the failure of the bill, President Joe Biden issued an executive order allowing officials to quickly remove immigrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum claims. The Trump campaign slammed the order as not going far enough. One of Donald Trump's key promises in this election is that, if re-elected, on day one of his presidency he will \"begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history\". Trump told Time magazine this year he would target up to 20 million undocumented migrants he claims are living in the US. \"Those on the left hear that and say, 'Oh my God, that sounds terrible.' I don't understand how that sounds terrible,\" says Chad Wolf, who served as Trump's acting Homeland Security secretary and who was in charge of the border. \"The idea of deporting individuals, removing individuals or repatriating individuals that, again, don't have a legal right to be here, or perhaps are here because the law has been abused to get them here, they need to be removed from the country.\" But for people like rancher Jim Chilton, who are on the front line of the migrant crisis, deportations aren't enough. \"President Trump was securing the border. He was building the wall,\" he says. \"It was a good policy … I would love for Trump to be re-elected and finish the wall and secure the border at the border.\" Watch Part 1 and Part 2 of the Four Corners special, Retribution, on ABC iview now.

(Reuters: Kevin Mohatt) Kimberly Cheatle has resigned as director of the Secret Service, after coming under scrutiny following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Democratic and Republican representatives called for Ms Cheatle to step aside following her testimony at a House oversight committee hearing on Tuesday. A bipartisan task force will be established to investigate the security failures that allowed the attempted assassination to happen. The director of the US Secret Service has resigned from her position after admitting that the attempted assassination of Donald Trump amounted to a failure of her mission to protect American leaders. The Secret Service has faced significant criticism in the week and a half since a 20-year-old gunman evaded security measures to shoot the Republican presidential candidate at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. As director, Kimberly Cheatle has come under intense scrutiny over why her agents were not able to prevent the shooter from taking a direct shot at the former president. Trump has said he came within \"a quarter-inch\" of losing his life to the bullet that grazed his right ear, and that it was only by the \"grace of God\" and the \"veryM very brave\" Secret Service agents who shielded him after the first shot that he survived. In a 92-minute speech, Donald Trump used Joe Biden's name only once, and asked a roaring crowd of party faithful to send him back to the White House. Meanwhile, the President endured another day of leaks and anonymous sources citing pressure for him to drop out of the race. The FBI is conducting a formal investigation into the assassination attempt, and Ms Cheatle also launched an internal investigation to review the security measures in place on that day. Ms Cheatle was subpoenaed to appear at a US congressional oversight hearing this week, where several committee members questioned her about security decisions surrounding the Pennsylvania rally and called on her to step down. She told the hearing that the incident was the agency's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, adding that she took \"full responsibility\". On Tuesday, local time, several US outlets published a letter reportedly sent by Ms Cheatle to her staff on Monday, announcing her decision to resign. \"To the men and women of the US Secret Service. The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders and financial infrastructure. On July 13, we fell short on that mission,\" she wrote. \"The scrutiny over the last week has been intense and will continue to remain as our operational tempo increases. As your director, I take full responsibility for the security lapse. \"In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your Director.\" President Joe Biden thanked Ms Cheatle \"for her decades of public service\" and added that he would appoint a new director soon. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced Deputy Director Ronald Rowe would step in as acting leader. An attempted assassination, an \"unacceptable\" Secret Service response and a subpoena demanding she appear before a public hearing — here's what's ahead for Kimberly Cheatle.  \"[Ms Cheatle] has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career in the United States Secret Service,\" Mr Biden wrote. \"As a leader, it takes honour, courage, and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organisation tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service.\" Appointed as director by Mr Biden in 2022, Ms Cheatle has served for more than two decades as a Secret Service agent. As well as providing security for the president and the Biden family, she has protected former president Bill Clinton and vice-president Dick Cheney following the September 11 attacks. In the letter reportedly sent to her staff, Ms Cheatle wrote that she did not want calls for her resignation to be a distraction from \"the great work each and every one of you do towards our vital mission\". During Monday's hearing, oversight committee members from both sides of the aisle appeared frustrated by Ms Cheatle's answers to questions about specific decisions that were made on the day of the assassination attempt. In her opening statement, Ms Cheatle explained that she may be limited in providing a thorough response due to the ongoing investigations, and stressed that she did not want to \"place blame for this failure\" on law enforcement partners supporting the Secret Service at the event. \"The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders. On July 13, we failed. As a director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse of our agency,\" she said. The committee played footage taken by people who were at the rally, that showed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, on the roof of the building adjacent to the showgrounds just minutes before he fired the shot that hit Trump on stage. Ms Cheatle was reluctant to provide details about why the shooter was not apprehended before he climbed onto the roof, and what level of security was assigned to the area outside the showgrounds perimeter. She did confirm that the gunman had been carrying a rangefinder on the day — a device similar in appearance to binoculars, which is used to measure distance between objects.  She said while he had been \"identified as suspicious\" before Trump took the stage, there was an important distinction between suspicious activity and threatening activity. \"If the detail [Secret Service agent] had been passed information that there was a threat, the detail would never have brought the former president out onto stage,\" she said. Ms Cheatle said that \"to the best of our knowledge\", the Secret Service did not know that Crooks had a weapon before Trump was escorted onto the stage. Several members pressed Ms Cheatle as to why she was not able to provide more information about how long the Secret Service had been aware of the suspect. \"Because Donald Trump is alive — and thank God he is — you look incompetent. If Donald Trump had been killed, you would have looked culpable,\" Republican Mike Turner said. Republican committee chair James Comer and ranking Democratic committee member Jamie Raskin wrote a joint letter on Monday, asking for Ms Cheatle to step aside. \"You failed to provide answers to basic questions regarding that stunning operational failure and to reassure the American people that the Secret Service has learned its lessons and begun to correct its systemic blunders and failures,\" they wrote. \"In the middle of a presidential election, the committee and the American people demand serious institutional accountability and transparency that you are not providing. \"We call on you to resign as director as a first step to allowing new leadership to swiftly address this crisis and rebuild the trust of a truly concerned Congress and the American people.\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday announced a bipartisan task force to investigate the security failures that allowed the attempted assassination to happen. The House will vote on a resolution to establish the task force this week, which is expected to be made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats. Mr Johnson was among the House oversight committee members calling for Ms Cheatle to resign during Monday's hearing. On Tuesday he welcomed her decision, saying it was \"overdue\". \"I'm glad she did the right thing … She should have done this at least a week ago,\" he said. Mr Raskin also welcomed Ms Cheatle's decision to resign, and expressed the need for bipartisan action on banning AR-15 and other assault-style weapons like the one used by the shooter in Pennsylvania. Asked to weigh in on the issue during Monday's hearing, Ms Cheatle would not be drawn. The Secret Service director did confirm media reports that officials had been able to use the gun's serial number to search sale records and identify the shooter, who had not been carrying an ID when he was killed after shooting at Trump. Democratic committee member Gerry Connolly asked several times whether \"the ubiquity of guns in America, especially assault weapons or semi-automatic weapons\" made her job harder or easier. Ms Cheatle repeatedly avoided answering the question, responding that \"the threat environment\" for Secret Service agents \"is always difficult, and that's dynamic, and it's always evolving\".

(Reuters: Tom Brenner/Kevin Mohatt) Donald Trump says he would be willing to debate Kamala Harris \"more than once\", as she locks up support as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The vice-president officially kicked off campaigning with a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday, local time, telling voters this election was \"a choice between freedom and chaos\". President Joe Biden has announced he will address the nation on Wednesday, local time, to discuss how he plans to see out his term. Donald Trump has indicated he's ready to engage in a debate with Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential election, as the presumptive Democratic nominee kicks off her campaign in earnest with a rally in the battleground state of Wisconsin. The vice-president has secured the broad support of her party to replace President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket. In his most extensive comments since Mr Biden dropped out of the race, Trump said he would be willing to debate Ms Harris \"more than once\". \"I think debating is important for a presidential race. You sort of have an obligation to debate,\" he told reporters in a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, local time. The Republican presidential candidate stopped short of committing to the next scheduled debate, which was due to be hosted by ABC News America in September. He had agreed to take part in a second debate with Mr Biden before the president dropped out of the race. But today he expressed that he was \"not thrilled\" with ABC, having previously suggested the debate should be moved to Fox News. Ms Harris's first rally since launching her campaign for the White House perhaps sets the stage for how the vice-president would approach a debate with her Republican opponent. The speech to an energetic crowd in Milwaukee followed the strategy laid out at campaign HQ in Delaware on Monday, with Ms Harris pitching her case against Trump as \"a choice between freedom and chaos\". \"In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she told her supporters at West Allis Central High School. \"In this election, we face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion, and the rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate? We each have the power to answer that question.\" She continued to highlight her background as a district attorney and attorney-general in contrast with Trump's chequered legal history, and sought to criticise his record in office.  \"America has tried these failed economic policies before. But we are not going back,\" she said, prompting a chant of \"we're not going back\". It came as the party rallied further behind Ms Harris, with the Democrats' leaders in both chambers of Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, officially endorsing the vice-president. \"She is ready. She is willing. She is able to energetically and emphatically lead America into the future,\" Mr Jeffries said. Kamala Harris's campaign says she has secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to become her party's nominee. So how could her campaign against Donald Trump shape up? The Harris campaign also announced that donations had reached a historic fundraising milestone, with more than $US100 million received since Sunday, the majority from first-time donors. The vice-president also appears to be enjoying a bump in public support, with a Reuters-Ipsos poll showing she has opened up a marginal two-point lead over Trump. In a survey conducted this week, respondents were asked who they would vote for if an election were held today — 44 per cent said Ms Harris, compared to 42 per cent who said Trump. The difference is within the 3-percentage-point margin of error. It shows a slight improvement in Ms Harris's support before Mr Biden dropped out of the race. Although national polls indicate broad voter sentiment, when it comes to election day, it will be the swing states where the winner is decided. The president announced on Tuesday that he would address the nation on Wednesday evening, local time, to discuss his plans to see out the rest of his term. He is planning to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this week, who is in Washington DC to address Congress. The visit is expected to draw significant protests in the US capital.  More than 200 congressional staffers have signed an anonymous letter stating they will boycott the address.

(Supplied; BTN High; ABC News: Sharon Gordon) Sixteen-year-old Quinn Mitchell — a self-confessed \"political enthusiast\" from New Hampshire in the United States — is worried about his country's future. \"It's definitely a very polarising and troubling time in America,\" he says, in an interview with BTN High. \"Former President Trump was almost assassinated in Pennsylvania by a gunman … others in the crowd, too, were critically injured and one other died. \"It's definitely scary, and it's definitely an interesting time to be a Gen-Zer.\" Former US president Donald Trump after being shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Although still a teen, Quinn is no politics newbie. He's attended more than 100 presidential events, according to his Twitter bio, and has also made headlines for putting tough questions to those in power. When asked how he feels about the political climate in North America following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump and Joe Biden's decision to pull out of the presidential race and back Vice President Kamala Harris, what immediately comes to mind for Quinn is how engaged his friends have become in recent weeks. \"It's just been about how many friends I have that aren't usually into this stuff [politics] being so in-tune … it's not something I'm used to,\" he says. \"I think a majority Americans feel worried because assassination attempts like that … it hasn't happened in a long time.\" US teen Chinu James says her country has become more divided. (Supplied: Chinu James) Chinu James, an 18-year-old student from the US state of Maryland, says as someone whose family emigrated to North America from countries in the Caribbean, she has also been watching the presidential race closely. \"I think with everything going on recently … it's definitely made the divide between Republicans and Democrats more apparent,\" she says. \"As a black girl in America … whether Biden wins, whether Trump wins — it's going to have an effect on my life.\" On the other side of the world, young Australians like 19-year-old Abou have also been following US politics. Abou worries \"right-leaning\" voices could become louder in Australia if Donald Trump wins the upcoming US election. (BTN High: Steve Opie) \"Mostly because … it is entertaining to watch. A lot of the drama that goes on … it spreads like wildfire across the internet,\" he says. But Emma Shortis, a senior researcher in international and security affairs at The Australia Institute, says Australians need to take US politics seriously. \"It's easy … to look at what's happening in the US and think, that's a kind of circus and we can turn away because it's messy and embarrassing — but what happens there will really matter to us,\" she says. Emma Shortis is a senior researcher in international and security affairs at the The Australia Institute. (Supplied) If Trump is returned to power in November's presidential election, for better or worse, the US is in for a big shake-up — one that could be felt for generations, both in America and here in Australia. To understand why the US election result has the potential to impact Australia, it's useful to look back at how the bond between the two countries has developed. Australia and the US fought side by side in World War II, and when our government believed Australia might be invaded, the US answered the call and sent troops to help. But Dr Shortis says the relationship really became official when Australia signed the Australia, New Zealand and United States (ANZUS) Security Treaty in 1951. \"Which lots of people actually think means we have a security guarantee from the US, like they'll come and rescue us if anything happens, but it's not that at all — it's just a commitment … to act and support each other,\" Dr Shortis says. Since then, Australia has joined the US in major wars, has created Pine Gap — a joint spy base with the US in the Northern Territory, and signed up for the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal. \"So, America is probably the most important country to Australia when it comes to our foreign policy,\" Dr Shortis says. The US is also seen as the most important economy in the world, and one of Australia's key free trade and investment partners. \"The strength of the American economy and the stability of the American economy is really important to Australia and to our economy as well,\" Dr Shortis says. Our countries also share similar cultures and values, and American influences are all around us, so decisions made in the US can end up having an impact here too. Dr Shortis says this is particularly true when it comes to who is in charge and what their policies are. Kamala Harris's campaign says she has secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to become her party's nominee. So how could her campaign against Donald Trump shape up? \"Not just Trump, but the people around him who would be running his administration, see China as an existential threat to the US that has to be answered with force,\" Dr Shortis says. \"And given Australia's submarine deal … that means that we potentially can be pulled into that [possible] conflict. \"But there's also a bunch of other stuff that would have big implications for Australia — climate action being one of the biggest ones.\" She says Trump and his team \"have really detailed plans to undo even the … inadequate climate action that the Biden administration has been able to achieve\". There could also be cultural implications for Australia, \"because so much of Trump's agenda is around [the] social and cultural … and you can see in Australia that the same kind of politics … are being encouraged\", Dr Shortis says. The US has had its fair share of political and cultural changes over the past few years, including the overturning of Roe v Wade, which abolished women's constitutional right to an abortion. Thousands across Australia took to the streets on the weekend to protest against the United States Roe v Wade ruling, with some protesters afraid that Australia's laws protecting a person's rights to abortion are \"fragile\". And that's changing how some young Americans — and Australians — view the US. Dr Shortis says these days, young Australians don't necessarily value our relationship with US in the same way previous generations have done. \"I think particularly in my parents' generation … there has been that real admiration of the US,\" she says. \"I don't think that lines up with how young Australians, in particular, see both the US and Australia's role in the world.  \"I think a lot of young people would hope … that Australia stands up for our values.\" On the streets of Adelaide, many teens agree. Jennifer, 14, says the US is \"definitely … a different political world to what we have here\", and Australia and the US \"don't rely on each other the same way as we used to\". Adelaide teen Jennifer believes Australia and the US don't rely on each other the way they used to. (BTN High: Steve Opie) Abou, 19, agrees, adding the US \"is not … as idolised as it used to be\". \"That picture of America being this big country … where dreams are made … with a lot of the conflict going on in the world right now, I feel like that perception is dying out,\" he says. Abou believes that Australians have more political options. \"We have a choice of people to lead us, compared to America, where it's only ever really two parties that are incredibly opposed,\" he says. \"Their leaders are … super old … [and] don't exactly have the interest of the growing population at heart, especially with the younger population.\" But he worries that a Trump victory could have flow-on effects for Australia. \"Trump's supporters, the more right-leaning traditional people … they'll become a louder majority … and I guess you might see that get pushed into our politics as well,\" Abou says. Masangay, 12, doesn't want to see Australia \"copying America\" when it comes to gun laws. (BTN High: Steve Opie) Masangay, 12, is also keen for Australia to stay true to its values, regardless of the US election result. \"America, they have guns and stuff, and Australia doesn't have guns,\" she says. \"I don't think we should be influenced by them … because we need to keep everyone in Australia safe.\" Dr Shortis says while US politics have the potential to impact Australia in a big way, we often underestimate our own power. \"We matter to the US as well, we have such a close relationship, and we could actually use that relationship for really good things,\" she says. \"We could encourage the best of the US, really lean into those cultural connections and our democratic connections and … focus on that part of the relationship, instead of the war fighting. \"So, I think there is room for hope, and also for Australia to actually use our influence.\" US student Quinn Mitchell, 16, wants young people to be more engaged in politics. (Supplied: Quinn Mitchell) Back in the US, teen political enthusiast Quinn Mitchell has a message for young people in the US and Australia. \"Make the effort to be involved … reach out to people,\" he says. \"Democracy depends on compromise, and that means talking to your neighbour who might think differently than you on some crucial issues.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:Voting Australia Defence and National Security Foreign Affairs Government and Politics Political Candidates Shootings Teenagers US Elections United States Unrest, Conflict and War World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

That includes personal ambition. \"So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. \"There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices and, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\" The Oval Office address marked Mr Biden's first extensive public comments since posting an open letter on social media announcing his decision on Sunday. \"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,\" he said.  \"And I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.  \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America, lies in your hands.\" Joe Biden has delivered remarks from the Oval Office, telling Americans \"now is the time for fresh voices\" and urging them to unite ahead of the November election.  In his final remarks, the president tells Americans, it's up to them. \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America, lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith. Keep the faith. \"And remember who we are, we are the United States of America. And there are simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. We do it together. So let's act together.\" The president says he has given his heart and soul to the United States. \"My fellow Americans, it has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. \"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president United States. But here I am.\" In closing, Joe Biden thanks his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who he describes as \"experienced, tough, capable\", and an \"incredible partner to me and a leader for our country\". \"Now the choice is up to you, the American people. \"When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin's, hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office … republic — if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\"  Mr Biden was in isolation with COVID when he announced his decision via the X platform, writing: \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\" It followed weeks of sustained pressure from a growing number of prominent Democrats who were concerned about his visible signs of aging, and his ability to compete with Republican nominee Donald Trump. Within minutes of the president's address, the Trump campaign sent a fundraising email to potential donors, which said if Mr Biden \"had an ounce of humility, he'd understand he's unfit to serve\". \"But now Kamala Harris is poised to continue his path of destruction. Shadow billionaires just unfroze tens of millions of dollars to bankroll her campaign!\" At an earlier campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump attacked his likely opponent as a \"radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office\". \"For three-and-a-half years, lyin' Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,\" he said. Mr Biden endorsed Ms Harris half an hour after announcing he would not run for re-election, and she has since won the backing of most top Democrats, including those who had been seen as her potential rivals.  On Monday, she announced she had secured the votes of the necessary number of delegates to lock in the nomination. She watched Mr Biden's address to the nation from Houston, Texas, where she had been briefed on recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl, a White House official said. Earlier on Wednesday, the vice-president made a pitch to thousands of Black women at an event in Indianapolis. \"Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energise, to organise and to mobilise,\" Ms Harris told the convention for a historically Black sorority group, Zeta Phi Beta.

FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday told the US House Judiciary Committee that suspect Thomas Crooks visited the Trump rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, twice before he clambered onto the roof of a nearby building on July 13 and fired off at least eight rounds, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one rally-goer and injuring two others. \"Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for — quote — 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Mr Wray said. He was referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated former president Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Thomas Matthew Crooks searched for information about the JFK assassination. \n\n\n  (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) \"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Mr Wray said. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" he added, saying Crooks became \"very focused on president Trump and his rally\" at that point after showing interest in public figures more generally. About two hours before the shooting, Crooks flew a drone over the area about 180 metres from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd, and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes. Law enforcement officers did not spot Crooks on the roof with his AR-15-style rifle until \"seconds\" before he opened fire, said Mr Wray, noting that the timeline could change as the investigators' understanding of facts evolves. \"It's all happening in seconds,\" Mr Wray said. He added that the rifle had a collapsible stock, \"which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.\" Crude explosive devices later recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him, Wray added. But he said the FBI believes the suspect would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. Mr Wray said many people have described Crooks as a loner and the list of contacts in his phone was short. The hearing also focused on the increasingly tense political atmosphere surrounding the presidential campaign. The Judiciary Committee has welcomed the FBI's new information.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) \"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated-threat environment. And tragically, the … assassination attempt is another example, particularly heinous,\" Mr Wray testified. A day before Mr Wray's testimony, Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the US Secret Service after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination. Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan welcomed Mr Wray's willingness to share details about the FBI investigation into the assassination attempt. A series of shots, two dead and a bloodied ear: what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania at the former president's campaign rally. But he also cited skepticism toward the FBI that exists among some Republicans, who are angry about the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Mr Jordan said. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" but pointed to years of political threats and violence, and violent rhetoric from Republicans including Trump himself. \"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" Mr Nadler said.

The couple are the last of the major party figures to throw their support behind the vice-president after Joe Biden announced he would no longer be contesting the 2024 presidential election. Ms Harris is expected to be confirmed as the official Democratic candidate before the party's national convention beginning on August 19. Former US president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have endorsed Kamala Harris in her White House bid, giving the vice-president the expected but still crucial backing of the nation's two most popular Democrats. The endorsement was announced on Friday morning US time in a video showing Harris accepting a joint phone call from the former first couple. As Joe Biden starts his long goodbye with a televised address from the Oval Office, Donald Trump and his likely rival in November's presidential election, Kamala Harris, have been trading blows as a recast race for the White House begins. The announcement comes as Ms Harris continues to build momentum as the party's likely nominee after President Joe Biden's decision to end his re-election bid and endorse his second-in-command against Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump. It also highlights the friendship and potentially historic link between the nation's first Black president and the first woman, first Black woman and first person of Asian descent to serve as vice-president, who is now vying to break those same barriers at the presidential rank. \"We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\" Mr Obama told Ms Harris, who is shown taking the call as she walks backstage at an event, trailed by a Secret Service agent. Ms Obama told the presumptive Democratic nominee: \"I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. \"This is going to be historic,\" she added. The former first couple were shown in a video calling Kamala Harris to offer their support. (Reuters: Jim Bourg) Ms Harris, who has known the Obamas since before his election in 2008, thanked them for their friendship and said she looked forward to \"getting there, being on the road\" with them in the three-month blitz before the November 5 election. \"We're gonna have some fun with this too, aren't we?\" she said. The Obamas are perhaps the last major party figures to endorse Harris formally — a reflection of the former president's desire to remain, at least publicly, a party elder operating above the fray. The couple remains a prodigious fundraising draw and popular surrogates at large campaign events for Democratic candidates. According to an Associated Press survey, Ms Harris already has secured the public support of a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which begins on August 19 in Chicago. The Democratic National Committee expects to hold a virtual nominating vote in the weeks prior that would make Harris and a yet-to-be-named running mate the official Democratic ticket. Mr Biden endorsed Ms Harris's campaign within an hour of announcing his decision last Sunday to end his campaign amid widespread concern about the 81-year-old president's ability to defeat Trump. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton followed in the days after. The Obamas, however, trod carefully as Harris secured the delegate commitments, made the rounds among core Democratic constituencies and raised more than $US120 million ($183 million) in donations. Since the end of the presidency of Barack Obama, who was 47 when he took his first oath of office, US politics has not only looked chaotic and unhinged, but tired and exhausted. American democracy has seemed more like an American gerontocracy. The public caution tracks how the former president handled the weeks between Mr Biden's debate debacle against Trump and the president's eventual decision to end his campaign: Mr Obama was a certain presence in the party's manoeuvres but he operated quietly. Barack Obama's initial statement after Mr Biden's announcement did not mention the vice-president. Instead, he spoke generically about coming up with a nominee to succeed Mr Biden: \"I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" the former president wrote. Both Obamas campaigned separately for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Mr Biden in 2020, including large rallies on the closing weekends before the election day. They delivered key speeches at the Democrats' convention in 2020, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic. The former president's speech was especially notable because he unveiled a full-throated attack on Trump as a threat to democracy, an argument that endures as part of Ms Harris's campaign.

Nancy Pelosi, a former house speaker and party elder, has been a colleague and ally of Joe Biden for more than three decades. \"Their strong friendship is rooted in a shared dedication to public service, and devotion to their families and their faith,\" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo told the Washington Post in 2021. But while they may share common values and mutual respect, the two influential Democratic figures recently found themselves at odds over the 2024 presidential race — and who should be at the top of the ticket. Pelosi is unapologetically a political animal, one who wants to win and is deeply committed to keeping Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump out of power. \"I'm more reptilian, cold blooded, to win the election,\" she said in 2023 about her dedication to ensuring a Democrat kept control of the White House. For a long time, she and members of her party believed Biden was their best chance at achieving such an outcome. But the presidential debate changed everything, turning the tide of voter opinion against Biden. As Democrats saw their chances of winning the November poll slipping away, a few members privately entreated the president to reconsider his options. When that failed, they became more public, launching a full-scale effort to convince him to step aside. Pelosi appears to have been a key figure in these talks. Pelosi was house speaker from 2007 to 2011 and 2019 to 2023. (Reuters: Mary F Calvert) \"Nancy made clear that they could do this the easy way or the hard way,\" one Democrat told Politico. \"She gave them three weeks of the easy way. It was about to be the hard way.\" While the former house speaker never called directly for the president to stand aside publicly, behind the scenes she was reportedly discussing Biden's precarious position with anxious Democrats and offering to be their soundboard. Longtime allies and observers of the former speaker told US media that Pelosi's position wasn't surprising and she has always been a \"vote counting tactician\" who knows how to win. But even for a political operator with decades of experience, taking on the president was a high-stakes gamble. Here's how she pulled it off. Nancy Pelosi was once one of the most powerful women in US politics. The scion of an influential Democratic family — her father was a congressman and her brother a mayor of Baltimore — the mother of five swiftly rose through the ranks of the party before she was elected to Congress in 1986. Pelosi made a name for herself in the party with her gift for fundraising. (Reuters: Lou Dematteis LD ) From there she went on to become Democratic house speaker from 2007 to 2011 and 2019 to 2023, occupying one of the highest positions in America's capital and becoming the only woman to have achieved such a rank. It made her a target for criticism from America's far right, who dismissed her as nothing more than an elitist liberal and regularly featured her in their attack ads. Left-leaning members of her own party also apparently felt, at times, frustrated by her positions, becoming fed up with her commitment to a centrist political agenda and what they perceived as her sluggishness in moving to impeach Trump. But her ability as speaker to secure votes for much-needed legislation as well as the loyalties of those around her was undeniable. Even after leaving the speakership in 2023, she remains a figure who wields enormous influence within the Democratic Party. \"Nancy Pelosi has been an outsize figure in the Democratic Party really for decades … she is a power broker in the party and as speaker of the house ran a very tight ship with the Democrats,\" says Emma Shortis, US expert and senior researcher at the Australia Institute. \"I think she's renowned for her ability, really, to herd cats.\" A combination of skilled negotiation tactics, natural political instincts and a gift for fundraising, has cemented her status in the party as someone to listen to — and one who should never be crossed. Nancy Pelosi's spokesperson refused to go into details about phone calls she had with Democrats when asked by US media. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Service via Reuters) \"She'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding,\" Alexandra Pelosi once said of her mother's approach to her opponents. \"No-one has ever won betting against Nancy Pelosi.\" For most of her political life, Pelosi used those skills to secure the upper hand against Republicans. But when her vision for a Democratic victory in 2024 was put under threat, Pelosi marshalled her political skills to take on the most powerful man in the party: the president. Watching the presidential debate was excruciating for Joe Biden's supporters and friends. Within the first few minutes, it was clear that something was seriously wrong. As he stumbled through answers and lost his train of thought, he looked and sounded out of sorts. Critics delivered a verdict on his \"poor\" debate performance, drawing allies to publicly rally around him in the aftermath, including Pelosi. A Biden spokesperson once described the president's relationship with Pelosi as \"rooted in a shared dedication to public service, and devotion to their families and their faith\". (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst) In an appearance on CNN on June 30, the former speaker — who was introduced as a 'close ally' of the president — asked people to not make a judgement based on \"one debate\". There was perhaps a slip of the tongue when she used the past tense to describe Biden’s time in power: \"It was a bad night, it was a great presidency.\" But she argued there had been little change in the polls since then and warned that trying to choose another nominee \"could be chaotic\". Biden attempted to right the ship, declaring in an interview on ABC America that he'd stand aside only if \"Lord Almighty\" told him to, but it wasn't enough to allay the fears of his own party. By the time Pelosi gave her next interview on July 10, she had a different message for the president. In a 10-minute appearance on \"Morning Joe\", which is watched by the president, she carefully sidestepped a question about whether Biden should run. Instead, she slyly suggested: \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\" Of course, Biden had already written a letter to Congress that he was \"firmly committed to staying in this race\", prompting observers to read between the lines of Pelosi's deliberate choice of words. While she didn't outright say he should leave the race, Dr Shortis said Pelosi's \"carefully calibrated comments\" were \"clearly coded for him\". But if Biden heard the message, he appeared to have ignored it. \"I think there would have been disappointment that he didn't read that writing on the wall,\" Dr Shortis said. A day later, Biden attempted to play the elder statesman as he hosted the leaders of NATO in Washington. Far from easing people's concerns, however, there were more stumbles in the public eye. He introduced Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy by the name of his arch-rival, Vladimir Putin, and in a rare press conference, called his own rival, Donald Trump, the vice-president. With the Democrats facing an avalanche of negative headlines, Pelosi reportedly picked up the phone and told aides, colleagues and even the president that she was sceptical he could win. Nancy Pelosi reportedly hit the phones in the aftermath of Biden's debate performance. (Reuters: Leah Millis) When asked about the details of these calls by the press, a Pelosi spokesperson refused to go into detail. \"Sadly, the feeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the speaker may have had with the president,\" they told CNN. But there was no denying the pressure was building on Biden, with some of those closest to Pelosi publicly coming out against him. Notably, Congressman Adam Schiff, said on July 17 that it was time for Biden to \"pass the torch\", a statement observers believed was likely sanctioned by Pelosi, given her position as his mentor and close ally. \"It was very clear [to] power brokers in the party, alongside Pelosi and particularly big donors, and even, a significant amount of American people, if you looked at the polling, the number of Democratic voters who wanted Biden to step outside was high and it was growing,\" Dr Shortis said. \"So the risk of being seen, I think, as kind of operating behind the scenes in that way was much smaller than the risk of doing nothing.\" Joe Biden, who walked the halls of power for half a century, built a career on relationships. But in the end, it was his decision alone to do something no president had done before.  Pelosi wasn't the only influential figure growing hesitant of the president's chances in November.  Barack Obama, a longtime confidant of Biden, was heavily engaged with the president's campaign in the early months of this year, making calls to the White House chief of staff and relaying advice to top aides, according to US media. But though he defended Biden after the debate, he remained silent as his former aides came out against the president. \"There have always been two Joe Bidens. The empathetic, decent, big-hearted leader, forged in loss and grief, finding the good in his friends and opponents, in love with America, arms wide and open with space for everyone,\" Jon Lovett, a former Obama speechwriter and Pod Save America co-host, wrote on X. \"And there's the blowhard with a chip on his shoulder, stubborn, something to prove, his fellow senators rolling their eyes as the finger wags harder and the stories get longer. Statesman and politician, hero and fool.\" Barack Obama was reportedly receiving calls from anxious Democrats ahead of Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Obama was also taking calls from congressional leaders, Democratic governors and key donors in which he shared their unease about the prospects for Biden's campaign. While he was careful not to share his view on whether the president should step down, his presence was said to have brought a \"Shakespearean quality to the drama now playing out, given their eight-year partnership\". Meanwhile, other influential Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, were weighing in on the president's future in the race. With the pressure campaign mounting, Joe Biden eventually set aside his personal ambition and made a decision for the good of the party. When the president ultimately bowed out of the race, he was isolated, struck down with a poorly-timed illness and confronting some disastrous polling numbers. But despite being abandoned by some of those closest to him, he still retained the heft of the presidency and commanded huge respect within the party. He used that power to ensure that he got the final say in who succeeded him. After he announced that he would no longer be contesting the election, he fully backed in Kamala Harris as the heir apparent. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he wrote on X. \"And it's been the best decision I've made.\" As the next-in-line to the president, Harris has been right beside him throughout the campaign, making her potential takeover more seamless than with any other candidate. But Pelosi and others weren't initially convinced the position should immediately fall to the vice-president. The former speaker was reportedly in favour of an open nomination process at their national convention in August, despite the risk it posed to the party's image as one of disunity. In a leaked account of a closed-door California Democrat meeting in early July, which was reported by the New York Times, Pelosi told colleagues she favoured a competitive process to find the president's replacement. One person familiar with her thinking told the newspaper she believed it would strengthen the candidates' chances of winning the general election. But Biden's solid backing of Harris disrupted those plans. His endorsement of his VP was quickly echoed by former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, in a move that appeared tactical and orchestrated. In the critical 12 hours after Biden had withdrawn from the race, there was a deluge of endorsements for Harris. Importantly, all the other politicians who'd been mentioned as challengers to the VP — people like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Californian Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer — endorsed Harris and thus ruled themselves out of contention. Dr Shortis said it was a sign the party had clearly made the decision to unify behind Harris \"in an attempt to leave the chaos of the last few weeks behind them\". \"I think that was very much deliberate on Biden's part,\" she said. Ultimately, Pelosi's role in Biden's ousting from the top of the ticket may never be fully understood. But whatever her position, the president can claim to have had a greater say in choosing his replacement and ushering in a new era for the party. It may offer some cold consolation in the months ahead. Pelosi has described herself as being \"more reptilian, cold blooded\" to ensure the Democrats win the election.

(Reuters: Library of Congress/Warren K Leffler) The last time a Democratic Party president decided not to run for re-election, the streets of Chicago descended into chaos. But before the violent protest and a pig being nominated for office — in August 1968, the Democratic National Convention was facing a dilemma. Joe Biden, who walked the halls of power for half a century, built a career on relationships. But in the end, it was his decision alone to do something no president had done before. Then-president Lyndon B Johnson had announced he was not going to run for a second term in the fast-approaching election. The other main contender for the Democratic nomination, Robert F Kennedy, had been assassinated two months prior. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, the ongoing Vietnam War, by then in its 13th year, and the continuing civil rights battle set the stage for a convention marred by conflict. Protesters and delegates flooded Chicago — what began as a standard political event devolved into a scene of police brutality, rioting and political absurdity. Months before the DNC got underway that year, the Democratic Party had become fiercely divided. Mr Johnson, who had taken over as president after the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963, had only barely won the New Hampshire primary elections in March. JFK's younger brother, senator Robert F Kennedy, and senator Eugene McCarthy were both in the running for the nomination. Both were beating him in opinion polls, and anti-war protests and the civil rights movement were ongoing. On March 31, Johnson told the country: \"Fifty-two months and 10 days ago, in a moment of tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me. \"[I] shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\" Four days later, Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in Tennessee. By mid-May, peace talks in Vietnam had become deadlocked. On June 5, RFK was shot dead outside a Los Angeles hotel. A revolutionary group called the Yippies — the Youth International Party — had been planning its DNC demonstrations for more than a year in advance. \"A week before the convention opened, the New York Times ran a story about the demonstrators saying that estimates of the turn-out 'ranged from a probably conservative 50,000 to a seemingly inflated over a million',\" wrote journalist Lewis Chester in a 1969 book on the campaign. \"Four days before [Chicago Mayor Richard J Daley] announced … 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'. \"[He] would put Chicago's 12,000-strong police force on 12-hour shifts, bring in 6,000 Illinois National Guardsmen, and have on tap 6,000 regular army troops complete with rifles, flame throwers, and bazookas. \"It was security in the paranoid style.\" This was the stage set for delegates as they began to arrive in Chicago. As delegates begin flying into Chicago on August 24, the Yippies have already nominated their own candidate. Pigasus. (Getty Images: Bettmann) \"Pigasus the Immortal\" — a large pig. The animal was picked out by group leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin and purchased by folk singer Phil Ochs. The nomination was short-lived — police descended on the group mid-nomination ceremony, arresting seven members and Pigasus. One member was able to get out a brief nomination speech, according to a New York Times article at the time. Pigasus, he said, was the ideal candidate because he \"was born in Montana, is 35 years old, studied law by candlelight for three years, and walked 5 miles through the snow to school\". The incident was caught and broadcast live by television crews. The group was charged with disorderly conduct. Protest drills, with protesters practising for the real event, continued to be held in the city's largest public park. The convention officially began on August 26 — along with the ongoing protest action outside, tensions were high on the inside. Ed Burke, then a 24-year-old police officer assigned to the convention, described the heated environment in a later book. \"After an invocation … and a syncopated rendition of the national anthem by Aretha Franklin, an unwieldy 5,011 delegates and alternates, the most ever at a Democratic convention, jammed the floor and made proceedings confused and order impossible,\" he wrote. \"The facilities were simply too small and aisles were clogged with delegates and alternates. Almost 10,000 spectators joined the ruckus.\" The convention hall was crowded with people from across the country. (Getty Images: Pictorial Parade) The opening speeches warned of trouble. Delegates were urged to \"listen only to the voices of your own conscience\". \"This is no ordinary convention,\" Indiana senator Birch Bayh told them. \"[And] this will be no ordinary election. For these are no ordinary times. \"While American soldiers are struggling in South-East Asia to secure the right of self-determination for a people who need it, half a world away in Eastern Europe, Soviet troops are denying self-determination to a people who seek it.\" Several groups, including the New York delegation seen here, staged protests on the convention floor. (Getty Images: Washington Bureau) Debates on that first day \"dragged on until the early hours of the morning\", according to the Chicago Tribune's Michael Killian. \"Even the hassle was delayed when the Pennsylvania delegation decided it didn't understand something and disappeared to caucus,\" he wrote. \"It was gone for more than half an hour, the interlude filled with organ music. \"The delegates waited, in agony, slumped in their seats, or wandering aimlessly. One glared at his watch, and groaned: 'I hate organ music,' then closed his eyes and thought of sleep.\" The tension only increased as the week went on, Mr Burke would later recall. \"Security became more physical, and by the night of the nominations, reporters and reform delegates were jostled, shoved, and punched,\" he wrote. \"Notebooks and newspapers were ripped from their hand. \"Cameras were jolted to the ground. Fights broke out on the convention floor while armed guards patrolled the catwalks overhead.\" Outside, the relatively small-scale demonstration that had nominated Pigasus almost a week earlier had grown. By August 28, police had forced thousands of protesters out of the park and into the streets — a decision that would culminate in the Battle of Michigan Avenue. A 17-minute melee broke out in front of the Conrad Hilton, where presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey was staying. \"The police gathered in groups … and then ran into the kids and swung their clubs, cops in blue helmets and short-sleeve blue shirts,\" New York columnist Jimmy Breslin wrote. \"Cops with bare arms, swinging in the television lights while they went for the head with their clubs, or for any place below the belt they could reach.\" Police clashed with crowds on the streets. (Getty Images: Michael Ochs Archives) Hotel guests throw things from the windows. Police pursued the crowd into the hotel through its front windows. The entire scene was broadcast live, with demonstrators chanting: \"The whole world is watching.\" In total, 600 protesters were arrested and more than 200 protesters and police officers were injured. Fifty years ago, protesters took to the streets in Paris, Prague and Chicago, demanding change, but the same themes are echoed in Donald Trump's America today. Hubert Humphrey won the Democratic nomination that night. Within days, multiple investigations into the violence were launched, including by the US Department of Justice and the city of Chicago. Months later, a group of protesters — later dubbed the Chicago 7 — would be indicted and a highly publicised trial would follow. Eight police officers were also indicted. The Democratic candidate, Hubert Humphrey, went on to lose the election by a narrow margin to his opponent, Republican Richard Nixon. A research team was ordered to investigate the cause of the violence by the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. The controversial report from the Chicago Study Team accused the police of criminal acts. \"Although the crowds were finally dispelled on the nights of violence in Chicago, the problems they represent have not been,\" their report said. \"Surely this is not the last time that a violent dissenting group will clash head-on with those whose duty it is to enforce the law. And the next time the whole world will be watching.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Crime Topic:Explainer History US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Trump has agreed to sit for a standard FBI victim's interview.  Police noticed the Pennsylvania man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump more than an hour before the July 13 shooting and took a photo to share with other law enforcement officers, according to the FBI. \"The shooter was identified by law enforcement as a suspicious person,\" Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office, told reporters at a briefing on the agency's investigation into the assassination attempt. He said a local officer took a photo of gunman Thomas Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene of Trump's Pennsylvania rally that day.  The FBI says Donald Trump was struck by a \"whole or fragmented\" bullet.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Some 30 minutes later, Mr Rojek said, SWAT team operators saw Crooks using a rangefinder and browsing news sites. Crooks was seen carrying a backpack at about 5:56pm, less than 20 minutes before the shooting took place, and at 6:08pm he was caught on a police dashboard camera walking on the roof from where he ultimately fired the shots, Mr Rojek said. Although the FBI is not the agency responsible for investigating lapses in Trump's security, FBI personnel are putting together a timeline of events, he said. The FBI says Thomas Crooks was a loner who made 25 firearm-related purchases in the lead-up to the shooting.  (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) FBI officials said they were yet to identify a motive for Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman, who was shot dead by a Secret Service agent after opening fire. But they said he had conducted online searches on prior mass shooting events, on improvised explosive devices and on the attempted assassination of the Slovakian prime minister in May. Trump, who has been highly critical of the FBI, has agreed to sit for a standard victim's interview, which \"will be consistent with any victim interview we do\", Mr Rojek said.  \"We want to get his perspective.\" Trump told Fox News the interview would take place on Thursday, local time.  Mr Rojek confirmed Trump was struck by a bullet, whether \"whole or fragmented into smaller pieces\". FBI officials have described Crooks as a loner who had no close friends or acquaintances, with his social circle limited primarily to immediate family members. Using encrypted applications, he made 25 firearm-related purchases and bought six chemical precursors used to make explosive devices, FBI officials told reporters. His longtime interest in science and doing science experiments did not rouse any suspicion from his parents, who the FBI said had been cooperative with its investigation.

(Reuters: Stephanie Scarbrough/Pool) The list of potential running mates for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris narrowed on Monday. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are both out. Candidates under consideration include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. The list of potential candidates to run alongside Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic US presidential nominee, has narrowed further. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are both out. The high stakes decision has taken centre stage since Vice-President Harris became the Democratic frontrunner for the November election just over a week ago after President Joe Biden ended his White House bid. Vice-presidential nominees can be used to balance a presidential candidate's ticket to appeal to a wider section of voters, and Harris is weighing a list of mostly white, male candidates. When Donald Trump was left bloodied by a would-be assassin's bullet, the political reality changed. Then, it was the Democrats' turn for a dramatic twist. Cooper withdrew from Harris's vice-presidential candidate pool, saying in a statement on Monday: \"I was honoured to be considered for this role. \"This just wasn't the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket.\" Also on Monday, Whitmer said on CBS Mornings that she was \"not a part of the vetting\" process to be a running mate.  \"I have communicated with everyone, including the people of Michigan, that I'm going to stay as governor until the end of my term at the end of 2026,\" she said. Harris took a break from the campaign trail this weekend and held private conversations with several of the candidates, according to two sources familiar with the calls. Josh Shapiro Age: 51 Current position: Governor of Pennsylvania Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. (USA Today Sports: Bill Streicher ) Mr Shapiro has been the popular first-term governor of Pennsylvania since 2023. Prior to that, he served as the state's attorney-general for two terms, from 2016 to 2022. During that time, he drew national interest for his investigation into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church and successfully fighting Trump's voter fraud claims in the 2020 election. He has been vocal about protecting abortion access in Pennsylvania after the overturning of Roe v Wade. Mr Shapiro, who is Jewish, has aggressively confronted what he has viewed as anti-Semitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas. Others under consideration include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. Andy Beshear Age: 46 Current position: Governor of Kentucky Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.  (AP: Timothy Easley) Mr Beshear gained a larger profile for his re-election victory in the historically red state last year. He is one of the youngest governors in the nation and has previously served as Kentucky attorney-general. When asked if he was interested in being VP, he told the Associated Press that he loved his job and planned to serve out his second term. Mark Kelly Age: 60 Current position: Senator for Arizona Senator for Arizona Mark Kelly. (AP: Manuel Balce Ceneta) As a former astronaut and navy veteran, Mr Kelly has one of the most interesting backgrounds of those in the race to be Ms Harris's running mate. He was first elected to the US Senate in a 2020 special election and was later re-elected to a full term in 2022. Mr Kelly has built a high profile as a gun-control advocate alongside his wife, former representative Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. While he usually toes the party line, Mr Kelly has previously broken rank to describe the entry of undocumented migrants across the southern border as a \"crisis\". Pete Buttigieg Age: 42 Current position: US Secretary of Transportation US secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Mr Buttigieg rose to prominence when he ran against Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He was mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020 and served seven years as an officer in the US Navy Reserve. The 42-year-old has been described as the party's \"best communicator\" and his age has been discussed as a potential asset to counter the 39-year-old Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance. During the 2020 presidential race, Mr Buttigieg helped Harris prepare for vice-presidential debates by playing her Republican rival, Mike Pence. He is the first openly gay person to serve in a US president's cabinet. Tim Walz Age: 60 Current position: Governor of Minnesota Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Mr Walz is a military veteran and former school teacher. He won his first election to the US House of Representatives in 2006 and was re-elected for another five terms serving Minnesota's First Congressional District in Southern Minnesota. He was first elected governor in 2018 and won re-election in 2022. At the weekend, he described the Republican opposition as \"weird people\" while speaking at a rally in his home state. The line gained traction around the country. \"We're a little bit creeped out [by them], but we're not afraid,\" Mr Walz told the crowd.

(Reuters: Kevin Mohatt) Acting director of the Secret Service Ronald Rowe told a Senate committee his agency had made a mistake in believing local Pennsylvania police would secure a building near the rally.  A shooter later climbed the building's rooftop and opened fire on Donald Trump's rally, killing one person and injuring three, including Trump. Mr Rowe said the Secret Service would \"never make that mistake again\" as multiple inquiries begin into the shooting. The US Secret Service's new acting director has said that he was \"ashamed\" of a security lapse that led to the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but blamed the shortfall on local law enforcement. In testimony before two Senate committees, Acting Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others with an AR-15-style rifle. \"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Mr Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees.  \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\" The first shooting of a US president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to the agency's former director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure. The director of the \"Project 2025\" plan for a Donald Trump presidency steps down after Democrats made attacking it central to their election campaign and Trump repeatedly distanced himself from it. But Mr Rowe went on to tell politicians that the Secret Service erred by assuming that local officials would cover the building and its roof, not the agency itself. Republican senator John Cornyn pushed back on the notion that the responsibility should have been left to others. \"Isn't that something that Secret Service should have covered, as opposed to delegating it to local law enforcement?\" Senator Cornyn asked. \"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Mr Rowe replied. \"I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\" Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal asked Mr Rowe: \"Ultimately, doesn't the buck stop with the Secret Service?\" \"It stops with us, sir,\" the acting director said.  But he added: \"If they'd just held their post and looked left.\" Mr Rowe's comments came days after a local SWAT team assigned to help protect Trump told American ABC News that it had no contact with Secret Service agents in charge of security at the rally before the shooting, and that an anticipated face-to-face briefing with Secret Service officials never happened. Mr Rowe said he has already taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the November 5 presidential election. FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified before the panels, said Mr Crooks appears to have posted violent anti-Semitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager. It is some of the first evidence of Mr Crooks's possible inclination toward extremism and political violence found by investigators, who have yet to identify a motive. Mr Abbate said investigators found a social media account dating to 2019-2020, when Mr Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old, adding that the account had posted more than 700 comments. The FBI says a local police officer took a photo of gunman Thomas Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene of Donald Trump's Pennsylvania rally before the shooting took place.  \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" Mr Abbate told politicians. Mr Crooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of the shooting, a flight that Secret Service officials failed to notice because a system for detecting drones was not working properly due to problems with the local cellular network, Mr Rowe said. Politicians sought to learn why the Secret Service did not delay the rally or prevent Trump from taking the stage, noting that local police saw Mr Crooks with a rangefinder device for measuring distances about an hour before the shooting. Mr Rowe said Mr Crooks was only one among a number of individuals to draw local law enforcement attention, and added that the Secret Service was not informed when local police saw Mr Crooks on the roof with the rife, just before he opened fire. One person died and two were critically injured by Thomas Crooks when he opened fire on the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) \"They were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Mr Rowe said. The proceedings grew heated when Republican senator Josh Hawley pushed Mr Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately. \"I will tell you, senator … that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgement and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Mr Rowe told Senator Hawley with a raised voice.

(Reuters: Ronda Churchill) The man who led Project 2025 — a controversial plan for Donald Trump's second term in office — is standing down. Donald Trump had distanced himself from the plan, which is not officially part of his platform, but Democrats had ramped up attacks on it and pointed out it was written by Trump allies and former staff. Kamala Harris's campaign has indicated it will continue to focus on Project 2025 on the trail. But Mr Trump's campaign said the project's \"demise would be greatly welcomed\". The director of the \"Project 2025\" plan for a Donald Trump presidency has stepped down after Democrats made attacking it central to their election campaign and Trump repeatedly distanced himself from it. Paul Dans, who predicted Project 2025 would become \"the engine room of the next administration\" in a recent interview with the ABC's Four Corners, will leave the initiative in August. Kamala Harris and, before her, Joe Biden had been frequently targeting Project 2025 on the campaign trail, highlighting its more radical proposals to expand presidential power and reshape government. That prompted Trump to declare he had \"nothing to do with\" the project, though many of the people who worked on it were his allies, including scores of his former staff. Mr Dans served as chief of staff in the Office of Personnel Management in the Trump administration. \"This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez insisted in a statement after today's announcement. But the Trump campaign said it had \"been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the president in any way\". \"Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.\" The Heritage Foundation think tank, which led Project 2025 in conjunction with more than 100 other conservative groups, said Mr Dans's work overseeing it was always due to end about now. It said Mr Dans left voluntarily and it was not under pressure from the Trump campaign. But a former Heritage Foundation aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was almost certain the Trump campaign had forced the shake-up. Trump campaign representatives did not respond to messages inquiring about whether the campaign pushed for Mr Dans to step down.  Mr Dans did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Also known as the \"Presidential Transition Project\", Project 2025 is spelled out in an almost 1,000-page document. One of the most controversial proposals involves replacing thousands of traditionally apolitical public servants with Trump loyalists. \"We have a database with over 10,000 people from all walks of life entering into this, aspiring to serve,\" Mr Dans told Four Corners. The proposal lines up with Trump's own plan, outlined on his campaign website, to \"shatter the deep state\".  He has vowed to revive a 2020 executive order to reclassify public servants working in policy roles as \"Schedule F\" employees, effectively turning them into political appointments.  That would strip job protections from potentially tens of thousands of government workers, making it easy for the president to sack them. Project 2025's other proposals include: Trump's march to re-take the White House defiantly continues. If he wins he'll have an \"army\" of 10,000 recruits at his disposal to help implement his controversial agenda. In July, Trump said \"some of the things\" proposed by Project 2025 were \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\".  \"Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them,\" he wrote on social media. But a CNN analysis later found at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had contributed to Project 2025, including at least six of his former cabinet secretaries.  In 2018, the Heritage Foundation said Trump had embraced nearly two-thirds of its 2016 blueprint within a year of taking office. And Trump's running mate, JD Vance, wrote a foreword to a forthcoming book by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts.  The foreword, obtained by The Associated Press, says: \"The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.\" The Harris campaign said Trump and Project 2025 had been working hand in glove.  \"Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real,\" it said. \"In fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.\" Mr Roberts said the project had \"completed exactly what it set out to do: bringing together over 110 leading conservative organisations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to devolve power from the unelected administrative state, and returning it to the people\". \"Our collective efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels — federal, state, and local — will continue,\" Mr Roberts said.

Ms Harris described Trump's remarks as the \"same old show\". Donald Trump has used an appearance at a gathering of Black journalists to suggest his election opponent, Kamala Harris, has switched racial identities from Indian to Black. \"I've known her a long time — indirectly, not directly very much — and she was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage,\" Trump said during a combative question-and-answer session at the event in Chicago. \"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black. And now she wants to be known as Black. \"So I don't know. Is she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she went, she became a Black person.\" Ms Harris's mother was born in India, and her father was born in Jamaica. Her official White House profile describes her as the first Black American and the first South Asian American to be elected vice-president. In her 2019 memoir, Ms Harris wrote: \"My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.\" Kamala Harris is the daughter of migrants from India and Jamaica. (Reuters: Erin Schaff/Pool) Trump was speaking at the annual convention for the National Association of Black Journalists. His invitation to speak sparked controversy among the organisation's members, and a co-chair stood down in protest. His appearance was hostile from the start. When a journalist cited examples of some of his past comments about Black people and asked why Black Americans should support him, he said her question was \"very nasty\" and lashed out at the event because it started late due to issues with the audio equipment.  He also suggested he had been invited under a \"false pretence\" because he had been told his opponent would be attending. \"It's a very rude introduction. I don't know exactly why you would do something like that,\" he said, and later added: \"I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln — that is my answer.\" Shortly after the event, the Harris campaign released a statement that didn't directly address Trump's remarks about the vice-president's racial identity, but said his \"tirade is simply a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump’s MAGA rallies this entire campaign\". \"Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency – while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in.  \"Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us.\" White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said Trump's comments were \"insulting\" and \"repulsive\".  He has questioned his Black opponents' backgrounds in the past.  For years, he promoted conspiracy theories about former president Barack Obama's nationality, and in 2012 offered $US5 million ($7.6 million) to anyone who could determine if he was actually born in the US. (Mr Obama's birth certificate, released publicly, shows he was born in Hawaii.) Ms Harris has been the target of racist and sexist attacks since winning widespread endorsement among Democrats to become the party's nominee for president.  Some Republicans have labelled her a \"DEI hire\", a reference to the common American abbreviation for diversity, equity and inclusion. Ms Harris addressed Trump's comments briefly on Wednesday night while speaking in Houston, Texas, at a gathering of Sigma Gamma Rho, a historically Black sorority in Houston. \"It was the same old show,\" she said. \"The divisiveness and the disrespect.\" Ms Harris added: \"And let me just say, the American people deserve better.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by John Lyons Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Ms Harris said she would officially accept the nomination next week after the voting period had closed. Ms Harris is the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination in the US. Kamala Harris has secured the delegate votes needed to clinch the Democratic US presidential nomination and become the first woman of colour at the top of a major party ticket. Ms Harris, the US vice-president, became the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden bowed to pressure from within the party and dropped out of the race last month.  Ms Harris quickly won the support of party heavyweights and was the only candidate to qualify for the Democratic presidential ballot, which ensured the outcome of the delegate voting was never in doubt. Party delegates voted virtually this week.  The online voting process doesn't end until Monday, but Ms Harris' campaign marked the moment when she crossed the threshold to have the majority of delegates' votes. Ms Harris, who joined the live stream event where the announcement was made, said she would officially accept the nomination next week after the virtual voting period had closed. \"But already I'm happy to know that we have enough delegates to secure the nomination,\" said Ms Harris, the first Black and Asian person to become US vice-president. \"And later this month, we will gather in Chicago united as one party where we're going to have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together.\" Ms Harris needed to pass a 2,350-vote threshold from delegates to formally secure the nomination, her campaign said. When Donald Trump was left bloodied by a would-be assassin's bullet, the political reality changed. Then, it was the Democrats' turn for a dramatic twist. Democratic National Committee (DNC) leaders had pledged to deliver a presidential nominee by August 7, before the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The DNC had said a virtual vote was needed to ensure the nomination process was completed by August 7, the date by which Ohio law required a nominee in place to make the state's ballot. Ohio lawmakers subsequently pushed back the deadline to September 1, but party officials said they nevertheless wanted to meet the August 7 deadline to avoid any legal risk in the state. The announcement came after the campaign said earlier that it raised $US310 million ($476 million) last month, an eye-popping sum showing that donors who once seemed spooked about the prospects for November's election with Mr Biden are now offering mountains of cash to boost his former No 2.

The Harris campaign has responded by saying Trump is trying to back out of a debate that had been set to run on rival US broadcaster ABC News. That debate was set to be between Trump and US President Joe Biden, who is no longer seeking re-election. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have clashed over the details for their first presidential debate, disagreeing on which broadcaster should host the event. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has proposed to debate Democratic US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Fox News in the lead-up to November's election.  In a post on Trump's social media platform Truth Social late on Friday US time, he said he would debate Ms Harris on Fox News on September 4. Trump said the rules would be similar to the first debate with President Joe Biden, who has since dropped his re-election bid. But the Harris campaign responded by saying Trump was trying to back out of a debate that had been set to run on rival US broadcaster ABC News. Trump and Mr Biden had agreed to a second debate on September 10 on ABC News, but the former president had suggested it should be moved to Fox. Joe Biden and Donald Trump debate's on CNN in June ultimately led to President Biden pulling out of the race. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign communications director, said: \"Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.\" \"We're happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to,\" Mr Tyler added. Trump said the debate would take place in the battleground state of Pennsylvania with a \"full arena audience\".  The first and only debate this year between Trump and Mr Biden had no in-house audience. Two weeks since Trump narrowly avoided assassination, the race for the White House is up-ended — and the Republican contender has long abandoned his short-lived shift to a \"nice\" tone. Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency. Trump's statement came shortly after the Democratic National Committee launched an advertising campaign on Friday. The ads taunted Trump, saying \"the convicted felon is afraid to debate\" and questioning whether that was due to his stance on abortion. June's presidential debate between Mr Biden and Trump was hosted by CNN. Mr Biden's performance ultimately led to calls for him to step out of the presidential race. After Mr Biden dropped out on July 21 and backed Ms Harris, Trump said he would not debate her because she was not the official candidate. Ms Harris said last month that she was \"ready\" to debate Trump after Fox News proposed a presidential debate between the two candidates on September 17.

(ABC News) Kamala Harris is only days away from making her first public appearance with her pick for vice-president — but her campaign says she still has not made a decision on who it will be. Donald Trump uses an appearance at a gathering of Black journalists to suggest his election opponent, Kamala Harris, has switched racial identities. The Democratic US presidential nominee is eyeing a number of candidates. Once decided, her VP pick will join her on a tour of multiple battleground states across the US ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month. Some have already dropped out of the race, including North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Ms Harris has also met with some of the top contenders for interviews in Washington at the weekend, according to Reuters. Here's who's still in the running — and what they bring to the table. The 51-year-old Pennsylvania governor has been out campaigning for Ms Harris in the last week, but said he hasn't spoken to her since July 21. Pennsylvania is a key swing state in the election, worth 19 electoral votes. He was elected to Pennsylvania's House of Representatives in 2004, going on to be Montgomery County commissioner and Pennsylvania's attorney-general. He became the state's 48th governor in 2022, with his campaign focusing on criticising his opponent's anti-abortion stance and controversy surrounding the US Capitol Riot. Asked whether he was being vetted as a potential VP candidate, he said he would not add \"any political pressure\" on to Ms Harris. \"She will make this deeply personal decision as to who she wants to run with and who she wants to govern with and move America forward with,\" he said. The New Republic's David Klion labelled him \"the one vice-presidential pick who could ruin Democratic unity\". A letter signed by nearly 50 progressive candidates urged Ms Harris to reconsider him as running mate, according to political news outlet The Hill. The letter noted while he was \"a valued member of the Democratic coalition\", he had become known for his \"shortcomings as a national candidate\". Founding director of progressive non-profit organisation The Institute for Public Accuracy Norman Solomon said picking Mr Shapiro \"could fracture support among the party\", calling the conflict in Gaza \"the most divisive issue\" among Democrats. \"To unify the party and defeat Trump's MAGA forces, Harris needs to distance herself in a meaningful way from Joe Biden's Gaza policy,\" he said. \"If she does so, she can win back the votes and energy of young activists, progressives, racial justice organisers, Arab Americans and Muslims — many of whom devoted weeks or months of their lives in 2020 to defeating Trump on behalf of the Biden-Harris ticket. \"In early April, after Democratic governors in other states had called for a ceasefire in Gaza, Muslim leaders in Philadelphia criticised Shapiro for his refusal to do so. \"Beginning in late April, Shapiro and his office repeatedly prodded campuses to 'restore order' and take action against student protest movements.\" The Minnesota governor has gained traction in the last few weeks, being widely credited as one of the first to label his conservative opponents \"weird\". \"These are weird people on the other side,\" the 60-year-old said in one now-viral MSNBC interview. \"They want to take books away, they want to be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas.\" Mr Walz was a high school teacher, football coach and member of the Army National Guard. After retiring, he was a member of Congress and elected as governor in 2018. In the past, he has referenced his own family's fertility struggles and use of IVF to emphasise reproductive rights, and spoken out against book bans. Under his leadership, Minnesota legalised cannabis and expanded background checks for firearms. But there are also concerns about his name recognition, geography and past controversies becoming a liability. Rutgers University political science professor Ross Baker told the Minnesota Post: \"The introduction problem is not an insignificant one.\" \"Voters would ask, 'Who is this guy and why was he chosen?' That's a burden for the campaign,\" he said. According to Politico, Ms Harris's campaign is weighing how well a \"gruff\" Mr Walz would mesh with Ms Harris. Mr Walz has previously come under fire for inadequate oversight of programs in Minnesota, including one that led to the theft of $US250 million ($385 million), one of the largest pandemic fraud cases in the US. He was also criticised for his delayed response to protests following the 2020 death of George Floyd. It was claimed Mr Walz waited too long to call in the Minnesota National Guard as violence broke out. The Kentucky governor was named as a potential replacement for President Joe Biden last month and has since been tipped as a top contender to be Ms Harris's running mate. The 46-year-old was elected as Kentucky's 63rd governor in 2019, having served as the state's attorney-general from 2015. Like other candidates, he has made several national news appearances taking aim at Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a move which prompted the New York Times to dub him \"the amiable attack dog\". During the pandemic, he gained more of a profile due to his nightly televised press briefings, with Democratic activist and former Kentucky Senate candidate Amy McGrath labelling him \"the great consoler\". \"He's really compassionate and responsive. And he's an on-the-ground kind of guy,\" she told The Independent. \"He's got the experience of an executive. He knows how to talk to voters who don't live on the coasts, who don't always agree with [his] party. And I think that is a big benefit to any ticket.\" But others have labelled his work as on par with most other governors at the time. Former George W Bush aide and Republican consultant Scott Jennings said Mr Beshear had simply performed adequately in a time of need. \"We had a tornado [and] he went around and he hugged people and handed out cases of water,\" he told The Independent. \"I would expect any governor to do that. I don't think that makes you a brilliant politician. He's a figurehead who hugs people when the weather gets bad. That's effectively what he does. And there's no magic in that.\" Mr Beshear leaned into supporting abortion rights, but critics have pointed to his pick of a \"personally pro-life\" lieutenant-governor. Kentucky is also a deep-red state that Democrats are unlikely to swing even with Mr Beshear on board. The 42-year-old former naval officer is currently the US transportation secretary. He dropped out of the 2020 presidential race and endorsed Joe Biden. While, like other candidates, he's remained coy about whether he is being vetted by Ms Harris's campaign, the New York Times reported Mr Buttigieg had organised a Zoom call with about 100 of his past donors about 24 hours after Mr Biden dropped out of the race. In the call, he reportedly told donors he was interested in being chosen. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would be the first openly gay vice-presidential nominee. As transportation secretary, he has also been at the forefront of high-profile challenges, including the Ohio train derailment and incidents involving Boeing. Last week, he was on a campaign tour across the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as his home state of Indiana. A former staffer of both Ms Harris and Mr Buttigieg, Rachel Palermo, said the two \"have a great rapport\". \"They recognise each other's talents and strengths,\" she told Politico. \"I think they both represent the future of the Democratic Party.\" However, like Mr Beshear, he is unlikely to provide an election boost given his background in Republican states Indiana and Michigan. Democratic fundraiser Susie Tompkins Bell, who backed Mr Buttigieg in 2020, said it would be \"expecting a lot\". \"I mean, we've got to go bold,\" she told the New York Times. \"It's big to have a woman of colour and a gay man. I think that would be ideal. That was my ideal team. But we also have to be realistic.\" The 60-year-old Arizona senator stepped in to fill a seat held by Senator John McCain, who died of brain cancer in 2018, and was re-elected in both the 2020 special election and the 2022 election. A former astronaut and US Navy captain, Mr Kelly criticised the Biden administration for its handling of immigration and campaigned in favour of abortion access. On Wednesday local time, Mr Kelly told MSNBC he was \"not going to get into any of that\" when asked whether he would join Ms Harris on her campaign tour. \"I am going to be focused on making sure that Kamala is the next president,\" he said. \"I'm going to be travelling across the country tirelessly. Next week, my plan right now is to be in Arizona.\" But his focus on passing bipartisan bills has raised some concerns over whether he will be able to fill the typical attack dog role of a presidential running mate. Democratic strategist John LaBombard told The Hill: \"The vice-presidential candidate really ideally would be somebody who would be comfortable being an attack dog on the other ticket but doing it in a way that's not off-putting to winnable voters.\" \"My guess is that Senator Kelly would have some growth to do in that part of the role, at least compared to Governor Walz,\" Mr LaBombard said. As the election cycle has intensified, Mr Kelly has made increased appearances on television, something he previously avoided. Potential vice-presidential running mates face a vetting process before they're chosen and announced. Previous vetters, usually campaign officials and lawyers, have said they typically take a month to comb through candidates' backgrounds. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper opted out of the vetting process, with ABC US reporting he had not submitted the requisite vetting material. The Harris campaign was believed to be initially looking at a dozen potential candidates which has rapidly narrowed. The woman who led former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's search in 2012, Beth Myers, told Politico their process \"started with a large, out-of-the-box group of names and whittled it down\" over a lengthy period. \"The [vetting] process she can do truncated, but what [Ms Harris] doesn't have is the luxury of being able to mull over not just the campaign,\" she said. \"We weren't looking at just a campaign partner. We were looking at a governing partner. A campaign partner might help you in a swing state. A governing partner would help you govern the United States of America. \"She will have to throw a lot more people on the vetting process than we did. We had a very small team. It was very discreet, very candid. In the last three weeks, one woman has emerged as the key driver of efforts to push the Democratic Party towards a historic decision. Here's how Nancy Pelosi helped put Kamala Harris on the ticket. \"When you have a little more time than Kamala does, you do have an opportunity to craft the narrative right out of the box, of how you want to present this candidate, knowing full well that there's going to be incoming from the opposition candidate and the scrutinising media.\" Since last week, delegates in the Democratic Party have been able to vote virtually to select their new nominee — that means the almost 4,000 pledged delegates have voted to approve Ms Harris as the party's nominee. She has formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination, making her the first woman of colour to lead a major party ticket in the US. An Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showed she locked down the necessary 1,976 party delegates a mere 32 hours after announcing she planned to run.  The five-day round of online balloting by DNC delegates ended on Monday night local time, with the party saying in a statement issued just before midnight that 99 per cent of delegates had voted for Ms Harris.  While she has to choose her running mate by August 7 US time — to meet Ohio's ballot deadline — her vice-presidential pick does not have to be nominated at the same time. The VP candidate will not be voted on. At the in-person convention held in Chicago later this month, delegates will hold a ceremonial vote, but the ticket will already be confirmed.

        "content": "Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN ABC RN Topic:US Elections Previous comments from JD Vance about childlessness, some directed at Kamala Harris, have drawn ire from women around the world. (Getty/ABC) \"Childless cat ladies unite!\" It's a catch-cry appearing on social media, emblazoned across T-shirts and headlining think pieces from commentators across the political spectrum. It's even galvanising Taylor Swift fans. Some have taken to TikTok to air their grievances. (TikTok) This full-throated retaliation is a response to 2021 comments by the Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance. Donald Trump has chosen Vance — a senator from Ohio — to be his running mate for November's US election. During a recently resurfaced interview on Fox News, Vance described high-profile Democrats as \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too\". Targeting Vice-President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, he lamented how \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children\". It's not the first time Vance has targeted those who are childfree.  In 2020, he told a conservative podcast that Americans without children were \"more sociopathic\" and made the country \"less stable\". And in 2021, Vance's fundraising emails referred to \"the serious issue of radical childless leaders in this country\". His comments have prompted an outcry from women around the world, including celebrities like actors Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler and Jennifer Aniston, comedian Chelsea Handler and musician Kesha. Aniston, who has been open about her struggles with fertility, was particularly vocal, writing on her Instagram: \"Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" Aniston took to Instagram to share her thoughts on Vance's comments. (Instagram) Pet lovers have also joined the fight, with slogans like \"Kittens for Kamala\" appearing at an annual gathering of cat enthusiasts, CatCon, over the weekend.  And last week, an online meeting of self-described \"cat ladies\" in support of Harris' presidential campaign featured a guest appearance by former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced that when Vance \"couched his opinion on our freedom\" he didn't realise \"what he would unleash\".  Vance has since said his comments weren't about \"criticising people who, for various reasons, didn't have kids\", but instead they were levelled at the Democratic Party for \"becoming anti-family and anti-child\". But while his comments have caused a political headache for Trump's campaign, they're the latest in a long history of politicians urging women to bear children — and berating them if they don't. Attacking women for not bearing children is a tried-and-tested political strategy, certainly not unique to the US. Similar commentary has been leveraged against former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, as well as Scottish politician Nicola Sturgeon and former British prime minister Theresa May. Examples closer to home include former prime minister Julia Gillard, who was called \"deliberately barren\" and therefore unfit for leadership by Liberal senator Bill Heffernan, and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, who was asked at a press conference if her lack of children was a \"disadvantage politically\". Julia Gillard has said she dealt with sexism during her time as prime minister, including comments about not having children. (AAP: Patrick Caruana) Prudence Flowers, senior lecturer in US history at Flinders University, says this preoccupation with female politicians having biological children is well established. \"There's a real pattern of women without children, particularly if they are powerful, being attacked for their lack of children as some kind of sign that they are selfish, that they are unwomanly, that they are unnatural,\" she tells ABC RN's Life Matters. Dr Flowers says it's interesting that Vance took aim at Harris, who is a stepmother to two children from her husband's first marriage. \"[He's] emphasising that she hasn't given birth to biological children … that she's a feminist, that she is career-oriented, that she's been selfish in prioritising her professional life over giving birth.\" But Dr Flowers makes the point that women in politics can be villainised regardless of their parenting status. She argues that had Harris \"lived the life that Donald Trump had lived — three husbands, five children to three different men\", she likely would have faced different but equally negative comments. After all, this happened to former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, whose choice to have a child while in office was called \"a betrayal of New Zealand voters\" by a political commentator. In 2018, Jacinda Ardern became the second world leader to give birth while in office. (Reuters: Carlo Allegri) In the current political climate, however, Dr Flowers says Vance's pro-natalist views have \"gone down very poorly\". \"There's been quite a lot of pushback from people, essentially arguing, 'Why is Kamala Harris in particular being held to this standard around needing to birth children when no other president has birthed children?' \"Vance has not birthed children. Why does birthing a child give you a sense of leadership?\" Experts say this kind of political rhetoric can be traced to long-established ideas about a woman's purpose and civic duty. \"What we're looking at is a socially reinforced social stigma,\" explains Imogene Smith, a clinical psychology registrar at the Cairnmillar Institute and former Deakin University researcher. Your comments, as told to ABC RN's Life Matters: \"I'm a teacher … and I get judgement because I haven't had kids. They think I don't know how to teach [students] properly because I'm not a parent.\" — Samantha \"[My daughters] said, 'Sorry, Mum, you're never going to be a grandmother'. They had decided that this was a world that they couldn't bring a child into … and I totally understand that. They are women who think, they're women who plan, they're women who look around, they're observant, and I'm very proud of them.\" — Fiona \"Any choice that we make that threatens a socially reinforced norm will often have blowback or a judgement associated with it, in this particular case, choosing not to have children. \"It's reinforced by film, television, advertising … When we see a message repeatedly like that, it's hard not to internalise it.\" Fran Baum, professor of health equity at The Stretton Institute, agrees. \"There's all this social pressure to have children: that's what you're expected to do, that's part of becoming an adult,\" she says. Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don’t need to be a scientist to find it! Those who opt out voluntarily can be viewed as \"a bit of a draft dodger\". \"It's very often seen as, if you're a good citizen, you have a baby … so while it's an intensely personal decision, it does become very political too,\" she says. Australians are used to hearing this from their politicians.  Many will recall Liberal treasurer Peter Costello's famous encouragement in 2004: \"Have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country\". And more recently, Labor Treasurer Jim Chalmers encouraged Australians to procreate amid fears of declining fertility rates in Australia. Dr Smith says that while birth rates are important for the wellbeing and prosperity of a society, politicians need to be careful about how they frame these conversations. Your comments, as told to ABC RN's Life Matters: \"A lot of people have just made the assumption that I'm not going to have children because I am 30 now and it hasn't happened yet. But I really just feel like I haven't made that decision yet … I try not to overthink it. If it happens, it happens. And if it doesn't, it doesn't.\" — Bridie \"I'm not cut out to be a mother. I've been a registered nurse for my life, so I've given to my country, despite what Donald Trump's mates think … So we haven't had children [and] we're pleased with our decision. We've made the right decision for the country and for ourselves.\" — Bronwyn \"Let's not beat around the bush, we do need to have children, but not everyone needs to have children,\" she says. \"It's these ideas of selfishness and coldness, 'cat lady', whatever you want to throw out there, being perpetuated by high-profile figures that are really not allowing this conversation to change. \"We're looking at decades of this same moral outrage being perpetuated.\" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

(AP Photo: Abbie Parr) Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a former school teacher and American football coach, will be Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 US election. Announcing her decision, Ms Harris pointed to his record bringing in abortion protections and gun controls in his state, and described him as a fighter for middle-class families. Ms Harris and Mr Walz will spend most of the coming week campaigning in swing states. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 US election. Ms Harris confirmed the news on social media on Tuesday morning, local time. \"One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle-class families run deep. It's personal,\" Ms Harris wrote. Mr Walz is seen as a plain-talking Midwesterner who can appeal to rural voters. The former school teacher served 12 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2018.He also served in the Army National Guard and coached American football. He said it was an honour of a lifetime to run with Ms Harris. \"I'm all in,\" he wrote on X. \"Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what's possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school.\" The 60-year-old second-term governor's selection comes after days of intense speculation.He recently gained national attention with his description of the Republican opposition as \"weird\", which has since become a favoured attack line of Democrats. Earlier this week, Mr Walz told a local fundraising event:  \"It wasn't a slur to call these guys weird. It was an observation.\" The Harris campaign is working to boost support in the Midwest region of the US, where states like Michigan and Wisconsin helped Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016. Trump's running mate, Ohio senator JD Vance, is also from the Midwest. Mr Vance said he'd left Mr Walz a congratulatory voicemail, but criticised his record on jobs and law and order. \"It is more instructive about what it says about Kamala Harris,\" Mr Vance told reporters aboard his campaign plane.  \"That she doesn't care about the border, that she doesn't care about crime, she doesn't care about American energy and, more importantly, she doesn't care about the Americans that have been made to suffer under those policies.\" Tim Walz has been Minnesota's governor since 2018. (AP: Abbie Parr) The Trump campaign has criticised Mr Walz as a \"radical leftist\" and a \"West Coast wannabe\", a reference to the relatively progressive politics of states like California. Mr Walz is joining Ms Harris following President Joe Biden's decision to end his re-election campaign.  The surprise move forced Ms Harris to unify Democrats and consider potential running mates during an exceedingly compressed time frame. Meanwhile, Republicans have rallied around Trump, their presidential nominee, after his attempted assassination in July.  Ms Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before narrowing the list to a handful of serious contenders — all of whom were white men. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was seen as the other favoured contender. His state is considered one of the most critical battlegrounds in the race for the White House. After Mr Walz was chosen, Mr Shapiro quickly offered his support, calling him \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward\". Mr Vance accused Ms Harris of listening \"to the Hamas wing of her own party\" before choosing Mr Walz over Mr Shapiro, who is a devout Jew and regular visitor to Israel.

The 46-year-old has been charged with murder for hire.  A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran has been charged in the United States in connection with a foiled plot to assassinate a US politician or government officials, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).  Asif Merchant sought to recruit people in the US to carry out the plot in retaliation for the US killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020, according to a criminal complaint released on Tuesday, local time.  The 46-year-old, who prosecutors allege spent time in Iran before travelling to the US from Pakistan, was charged with murder for hire in federal court in New York's Brooklyn borough.  A federal judge ordered him detained on July 17, according to court records. \"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" Attorney-General Merrick Garland said in a statement. (AP) FBI investigators believe that former president Donald Trump, who approved the drone strike on Soleimani, and other current and former US government officials were the intended targets of the plot, CNN reported, citing a US official. Court documents do not name the alleged targets of the plot.  Mr Merchant told a law enforcement informant that there would be \"security all around\" one target, according to the criminal complaint. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment further.  Avraham Moskowitz, a lawyer for Mr Merchant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump's presidential campaign could not immediately be reached for comment. Trump, the Republican candidate in the looming presidential election, was wounded in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last month.  Mr Garland said on Tuesday that investigators have found no evidence that Mr Merchant had any connection to the shooting, which officials have said was carried out by a lone 20-year-old gunman. Law enforcement thwarted Mr Merchant's plan before any attack was carried out.  An individual Mr Merchant contacted in April to help assist with the plot reported his activities to law enforcement and became a confidential informant, according to the complaint.

You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. We will leave you with Brad Ryan's piece on a more in-depth look into who Tim Walz is. By Elissa Steedman Psst Elissa is it worth commenting on *why* Trump needed to choose a different running mate this time around? - Michael To say there's some bad blood between the pair would be putting it lightly. Mike Pence was the first vice-president in modern history to challenge the president under whom he served.  He has alleged that Trump forced him to choose between his former boss and the constitution on January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the US Capitol over false claims of voter fraud. In the election interference case against him, Trump is accused of repeatedly attempting to enlist Pence to \"fraudulently alter\" the results of the 2020 election. Pence has been a vocal critic of Trump in the years following their administration and ran against him in the Republican primaries for this election.  He ultimately dropped his bid for the party's presidential nomination after struggling to gain traction in the polls. You can look back at some of his comments made in June 2023 below. By Caitlin Rawling Planet America co-host John Barron says Tim Walz being picked as Kamala Harris's running mate is a \"surprising\" one. He says everyone expected her to choose Governor of Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro as her vice-president candidate. Barron says going for Walz is interesting as he is a different sort of character. \"Tim Walz is like your favourite school teacher, that you wish was your dad because he really understands you,\" Barron tells News Channel. By Elissa Steedman Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Before starting his career in politics, Walz was a teacher and high school football coach and also served in the Army National Guard. He's gained a bit of attention recently for calling Republicans \"weird\" — a line that has since caught on among other Democrats. Here's a breakdown of his life and career by ABC News presenter Gemma Veness. By Elissa Steedman That's what they're hoping to become. If a candidate for president wins the election, their running mate will become vice-president. This is how Kamala Harris got her current role after campaigning as President Joe Biden's running mate in the 2020 election. Biden also served as vice-president from 2009 to 2017, having been former president Barack Obama's running mate. Donald Trump has had two running mates over the years. For the 2016 election, he won with then-Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  They ran again in 2020 but were ultimately beaten by the Biden-Harris ticket. Trump named JD Vance as his running mate for this year's election at the Republican National Convention in July. By Caitlin Rawling The former CEO of the Democratic National Committee Amy Dacey has shared what she thinks about Tim Walz becoming Kamala Harris's running mate. \"I think where she landed was incredibly smart. I think he's strong, I think he adds to the ticket,\" she tells News Channel. \"I think he brings in a contrast, in his experiences as well, that can play well in various parts of the country.\" By Elissa Steedman Hi Caitlin, how is Harris saying she's the official Democratic nominee when the National cOnvention has yet to confirm this? - Tim from Canberra Normally we do have to wait for a party's national convention to see their presidential nominee to formally confirmed by a delegate roll call. That was certainly the case with the Republicans, who officially nominated Donald Trump as their candidate at their convention back in July. But the Democrats chose to hold a virtual roll call yesterday, which means Harris has now been officially nominated. They've done it this way to clear a potential hurdle with the Ohio ballot. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, August 7 — almost two weeks before the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off on August 19. So the Democrats needed to have their candidate confirmed before then if they wanted to win any votes in Ohio. Here's a deep dive by Planet America into how national conventions work. By Caitlin Rawling US journalist and former assistant managing editor of NPR Bill Wyman says Kamala Harris choosing Tim Walz as her vice-president pick, is what \"in America you would call, the west wing election of a liberal's dream.\" You can watch the full interview here. By Elissa Steedman We posted earlier that the Harris campaign had raised more than $US10 million from grassroots supporters since naming Walz as her running mate. That's now up to $US20 million, according to campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz. By Caitlin Rawling Former US president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, have shared their support for Tim Walz. The Obama's shared their support in a tweet. \"Like Vice President Harris, Governor @Tim_Walz believes that government works to serve us. Not just some of us, but all of us,\" Barack Obama tweeted. \"That's what makes him an outstanding governor, and that's what will make him an even better vice president.\" By Elissa Steedman Walz leaned into the line that first gained him national attention. He was the first to describe Republicans as \"weird\", which has now become one of the Democrats' favourite attack lines.  \"I gotta tell you, just an observation of mine that I made, I just have to say it.  \"You know it, you feel it: these guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell. He then led the crowd on a chant of \"we're not going back\", in reference to Trump's term as president. By Elissa Steedman In another comparison to the Republican ticket, Walz again leaned on his working-class roots. \"Donald Trump's not fighting for you or your family. \"He never sat at that kitchen table like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. \"He sat at his country club in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he was going to cut taxes for his rich friends.\" Trump actually acquired Mar-a-Lago in 1985, when he was 38. But he did grow up wealthy — according to The New York Times, he was \"a millionaire by age eight\", thanks to his father Fred Trump's empire.  Republican vice-president nominee JD Vance didn't get away unscathed, either. \"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicone Valley billionaires and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community... \"Come on, that's not what Middle America is. I cannot wait to debate that guy.\" By Caitlin Rawling It is no surprise Kamala Harris was going to be voted in as the Democratic nominee, however it hasn't been officially announced by Harris herself until today. \"I stand before you today, to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for president of the United States,\" Kamala Harris says at the rally in Philadelphia. By Elissa Steedman After spending some time reflecting on the values he \"learned on the family farm\", Walz has moved on to take a swipe at Trump.  \"Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us.  \"First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service. He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself. \"Again, and again, and again, Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand. \"He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division and that's to say nothing of his record as president.\" By Elissa Steedman Walz has told the crowd his students are the reason he got into politics. \"But it was my students, they encouraged me to run for office. \"They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: a commitment to common good, the belief that one person can make a difference. \"So in 2006, I took a leap and I ran for Congress.\" By Elissa Steedman Harris has wrapped up her speech and given the floor to Tim Walz. \"Thank you Madam Vice-President for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy,\" he began. \"I'm thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug, this incredible journey.\" By Elissa Steedman With Walz being a former high school football coach, we could be in for more sports metaphors than usual this election campaign. Harris has used one already to compare her running mate to his Republican equivalent, JD Vance. \"With his experience, I'm telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one. \"In fact, when you compare his resume to Trump's running mate, well, some might say it's like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad.\" For those who aren't well-versed in American football, JV here stands for junior varsity. That's the team freshmen and sophomore students play on if they still need some extra training before making the varsity roster. By Elissa Steedman Harris's campaign is making the middle class a main focus. \"Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things, including when our middle class is strong, America is strong.  \"Strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal as I am president of the United States.\"  These comments echo the initial statement she made when announcing Walz would be her running mate, where she described him as a fighter for middle-class families. You can read more about the announcement below. By Elissa Steedman The vice-president has turned the spotlight on her running mate, Tim Walz. She's currently giving the crowd a bit of a biography of Walz and is focusing on his experience as a teacher and high school football coach. \"Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything. And together, hear this out, they defied the odds, going from a winless record to the schools first-ever state championship. \"As I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having and that every kid deserves.\" By Elissa Steedman Harris is framing her campaign as the underdog ticket. \"I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic Nominee for President of the United States. \"And so now we've got some work to do — we need to move to the General Election and win that. \"And to all the friends, we also need to level-set. We are the underdog in this race but we have momentum and I know exactly what we are up against.\" She's leaning on her experience as attorney-general, telling the crowd she knows \"Donald Trump's type\". That comment drew a chant of \"lock him up\" from supporters. \"This campaign, our campaign, is not just a fight against Donald Trump — our campaign, this campaign, is a fight for the future.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Now he has just 90 days to convince American voters to put him and Harris in the White House.  So who is Tim Walz? Here are nine fast facts about the governor.  Though Walz is the governor of the northern US state of Minnesota, he hails from Nebraska, further south. He grew up in the tiny town of Butte, which had a population of just a few hundred, and spent summers working on the family farm. At 17, he joined the military, following in his veteran father's footsteps. He then spent 24 years in the Army National Guard – the main combat reserve of the US Army. Helped by \"GI Bill\" benefits, which cover higher education costs for American service members, he studied to become a teacher.  He taught social studies in high school before entering politics. While teaching in his native Nebraska, he met his wife, a fellow teacher from Minnesota.  Soon after, they moved to Mankato, a Minnesota city of about 45,000 people, to be closer to her family. It's something of an unusual resume for a Democratic VP pick. The Washington Post reports he's the first one who didn't go to law school since 1964. But Democrats hope his rural and military background will help them win over moderate, middle-ground voters. They've already produced a campaign ad highlighting his country credentials. After graduating with a degree in social science education, Walz moved to China in 1989 – the year of its brutal Tiananmen Square massacre.  According to a congressional biography, he was part of the \"first government-sanctioned groups of American educators to teach in China through a program at Harvard University\". In a 2016 interview with an agriculture publication, he said he'd been to China about 30 times.  \"I don't fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,\" he said in the interview. \"I totally disagree, and I think we need to stand firm on, what they're doing in the South China Sea, but there's many areas of cooperation that we can work on.\" An edited clip of that clip is now being shared on social media by some of Trump's supporters, but without mention of the year it was shot, and cut to remove his comment on the South China Sea. While working as a teacher in Mankato in the 90s, Walz was a coach for the school's American football team. He helped to lead it to its first state championship. At the same time, he became the faculty adviser for the school's new gay-straight alliance. Before getting into politics, Tim Walz was a public school teacher.  (X: Tim Walz) \"The fact that he took on that role while also being the football coach was so important,\" the school's first openly gay student told the Washington Post last week.  \"He set an example not just for LGTBQ students but for football players in the locker room at a time when gay people were not well understood.\" Before he was elected Minnesota governor, Walz was a member of the national Congress, representing the state's first congressional district. He defeated the Republican incumbent, who had held the district for 12 years, in 2007. But when he quit Congress to become governor in 2019, the Republicans won it back. It's a mostly rural district with a mostly Republican history, and Walz's success in winning it – and holding onto it for so long – is seen as evidence of his appeal to more conservative country voters.   Walz has sought to portray himself as both pro-gun and pro-gun control. In an interview with CNN last week, for example, he compared his shooting credentials with those of his now-opponent in the VP race. \"JD Vance's schtick is talking about guns,\" he said. \"I guarantee you he can't shoot pheasants like I can.\" Tim Walz (front row, second from right) is a passionate pheasant hunter, but supports a ban on assault weapons.  (Facebook: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources) The powerful National Rifle Association (NRA), one of America's most influential lobby groups, endorsed him while he was in Congress. In 2016, he featured in the top 20 politicians for gun owners in popular shooters' magazine Guns & Ammo. But he fell out of favour with the gun lobby while campaigning to be Minnesota governor in 2018. After a mass shooting at a Florida school that year, he came out in support of a ban on assault weapons. More recently, he's signed gun control measures into state law. They include compulsory background checks for gun owners, and \"red flag laws\" that allow authorities to seize guns from people deemed to be a threat to themselves or others. \"As a veteran, gun owner, hunter and dad, I know basic gun safety isn't a threat to the Second Amendment – it’s about keeping our kids safe,\" he said last year. The murder of George Floyd by a police officer in 2020 led to protests in Minneapolis, the largest city in Minnesota. Some turned into violent riots. According to a state senate report, more than 1,500 businesses and buildings were vandalised and burned, causing $US500 million ($766 million) in property damage. As governor, Walz has been criticised for not acting sooner to bring rioting in the city centre under control. Critics say his decision to wait several days before activating the Minnesota National Guard was a grave error. The report, published by the Republican-controlled state senate, said Walz and the local mayor \"failed to realise the seriousness of the riots and the danger to Minnesotans if rioters were not confronted and stopped\". It also says they \"failed to act in a timely manner to confront rioters with necessary force due to an ill-conceived philosophical belief that such an action would exacerbate the rioting\". Tim Walz was criticised for delays calling in the National Guard to deal with riots in Minneapolis. (AP: Carlos Gonzalez) After Harris chose Walz as her VP running mate, his Republican opponent JD Vance said: \"They make an interesting tag team, because of course Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020, and then the few who got caught, Kamala Harris helped bail them out of jail.\" (Harris tweeted a link to the 'Minnesota Freedom Fund' to raise money for protesters in Minnesota at the time.) Walz told a recent press conference: \"Decisions were made in a situation, that is what it is, and I said we believed we tried to do the best that we can in each of those.\" Walz is not a household name outside of Minnesota.  But he won some fame when he began describing some Republicans as \"weird\" during recent media interviews.  \"These guys are just weird,\" he told MSNBC. \"They're running for He-Man Woman-Haters Club or something.\" It was seen as a shift from the Democrats' usual attack lines, which tend to focus on Trump as a convicted criminal and a threat to democracy. But it's been widely shared on social media, and it has since stuck. In the past couple of weeks, many Democrats have been hammering the \"weirdness\" of their Republican opponents. And Walz is sticking with it too. \"These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell,\" he told his first campaign rally with Harris. In announcing Walz as her pick, Harris pointed to his record on hot-button issues like gun control and abortion rights. The Trump campaign is pointing to his progressive record too.  \"It’s no surprise that San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate,\" the campaign said.  \"Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State. \"From proposing his own carbon-free agenda to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide.\" Trump himself later posted to social media: \"This is the most Radical Left duo in American history. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again.\" Harris reportedly started with a shortlist of about a dozen potential running mates. In recent days, it appeared to have narrowed to three. Tim Walz is the governor of Minnesota.  (Instagram: Tim Walz) The other two were from critical swing states: senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Both are popular locally and could have given Harris an edge in their respective states, which are likely to come down to the wire. But Harris chose Walz, despite the fact Minnesota is already a relatively reliably Democratic-voting state in national elections. Citing \"three people familiar with the vice-president's thinking\", the New York Times reports that Walz \"leapfrogged better-known contenders in part because Ms Harris viewed him as an Everyman figure from Minnesota whose Midwestern-dad-vibe balanced out her Bay Area background\".  Harris and Walz are now embarking on a tour of the swing states, starting in Pennsylvania, where they've appeared together at their first rally. \"Thank you, Madam Vice-President, for the trust you put in me,\" Walz said to Harris on stage. \"But maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

The Minnesota governor's military record has been slammed and he's been labelled \"dangerously liberal\". Analysts say both parties will continue probing for messages that work against the other candidates. Republican insiders say the party is celebrating the news that Vice-President Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz as her running mate in the 2024 US election. And in the hours since the little known Minnesota governor was pitted as the Democratic VP pick, they have been trying out attack lines.  They have slammed Mr Walz's military record and called him a \"radical left\", in an attempt to shape his identity and see which message sticks. Mr Walz recently gained national attention for his description of the Republican opposition as \"weird\", which has since become a favoured taunt of Democrats. Now the Trump campaign and its right-wing allies have come out swinging. Only a few weeks ago, many Americans outside Minnesota had never heard of Tim Walz. Now, he he might be the country's next vice-president.  Former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, welcomed Ms Harris's choice.  \"He's a very liberal man, and he's a shocking pick,\" Mr Trump told Fox News. \"I could not be more thrilled.\" Mr Trump has been aiming to gain attack traction by painting the Democratic pair as the most \"radical left\" ticket in history. He labelled Mr Walz as \"far left\" and \"dangerously liberal\". \"This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner. We want no security. We want no anything,\" Mr Trump said. \"He's very heavy into transgender. Anything transgender he thinks is great, and he's not where the country is on anything.\" Before getting into politics, Tim Walz was a public school teacher.  (X: Tim Walz) Mr Walz is seen as a plain-talking Midwesterner who can appeal to rural voters. But he also emerged as a prominent champion for transgender rights and gender-affirming care. Last year, he signed an executive order protecting trans patients' ability to receive medical care that helps them live according to their gender identity.  The order also protects patients and health providers from punishment by other states for delivering such care.  These types of measures have led to Minnesota being known as a \"trans refuge\". Tim Walz has been Minnesota's governor since 2018. (AP: Abbie Parr) Mr Trump also attacked Mr Walz as weak on immigration. He wrote on social media that Mr Walz would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals\". Mr Walz served in the Army National Guard, was once a school teacher, and served 12 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2018. In his interview on Fox News, Mr Trump raised Mr Walz's handling of the riots in Minnesota in 2020, which were sparked by the murder of George Floyd by police in the state. Mr Walz has faced criticism by some Republicans for being slow to activate the National Guard to quell the protests. JD Vance, Mr Trump's choice for vice-president, has also been repeating \"far left\" rhetoric. Tim Walz, a conservative-looking progressive, has a backstory that is so quintessentially small-town America, it feels almost made up.  Speaking at a rally in Michigan, he said Mr Walz was chosen because Ms Harris was a \"radical herself\". Mr Vance, who served in the Marine Corps and was a public affairs officer during a six-month stint in Iraq, also slammed Mr Walz's military record. Mr Walz, who served in the Guard for 24 years, retired to run for Congress. The GOP VP candidate said he abandoned his National Guard battalion right before its deployment to Iraq in 2005. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him — a fact that he's been criticised for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful,\" Mr Vance said. Mr Trump also posted about the \"abandonment\" on social media, calling Mr Walz a \"disgrace\". Kamala Harris and Tim Walz appeared together in Philadelphia hours after she announced her decision. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) When Ms Harris announced Mr Walz as her VP pick, she emphasised his military record. Her campaign has framed his decision to leave the National Guard and pursue a career in politics as a new pathway to help service members and veterans. \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,\" Ms Harris' campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement. \"And as vice-president he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"  Matt Klink, a political consultant and strategist, said it was the role of vice-presidential candidates to act as the \"attack dogs\". So far, Mr Walz has tried to position Mr Vance as an elitist because he went to Harvard Law School and worked for venture capitals firm. \"What the campaigns are doing right now is they're probing for messages that work against the other candidates,\" Mr Klink told ABC RN Breakfast.  \"Both vice-presidential candidates are going to be attack dogs so the presidential nominees can come out and talk about their visions.\" Ms Harris said she chose the 60-year-old governor as her running-mate for \"his convictions on fighting for middle class families\". And noted he signed legislation intended to protect abortion access, curb gun violence and enshrine voting rights. Republican senators and right-wing media have been jumping on these \"liberal policies\" to further push the narrative about his \"extremist\" agenda. Donald Trump (right) stands with his Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance. (Reuters: Tom Brenner) \"If you had any doubt that Kamala Harris is deeply liberal, look no further than the fact that her VP pick was endorsed by Bernie Sanders,\" Republican senator Lindsay Graham said. \"Great day for the left, bad day for middle America.\" Trump's campaign secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said: \"Just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist\". Several Fox News commentators also repeated similar lines. Sean Hannity called Mr Walz the \"most far-left governor in the United States\". Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump attend his campaign in Michigan. (Reuters: Tom Brenner) Political consultant Mr Klink said the Republicans would continue to pick apart the Harris-Walz ticket by saying they are too progressive. \"Collectively, their record is is decidedly left of centre in an America that's right of centre,\" he said.  \"But the caveat is, this election focuses on one person, and either you love Donald Trump or you hate Donald Trump.\" Polls show Ms Harris has erased the lead Mr Trump had built during the final faltering weeks of President Joe Biden's campaign. And a re-energised Democratic Party has flooded her campaign with donations since she rose to the top of the ticket two weeks ago. The Harris campaign said it raised $US36 million ($53 million) in the 24 hours after announcing Mr Walz as the vice-presidential pick on Tuesday. A former congressman, Mr Walz has won elections in a Republican-leaning district before becoming governor. Mr Klink said the governor's Midwest personality was part of his appeal. \"We have a saying in the US — they call it 'Midwest nice',\" he said. \"It's really hard to not like governor Waltz. He's kind of folksy, he smiles a lot, he was a former American football coach. \"He has that 'go team' attitude that it is very appealing to a lot of people.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Analysis by Barbara Miller US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Police have released new bodycam footage showing the moment an officer made contact with the man who attempted to assassinate former president Donald Trump.  Warning: This story contains graphic details and imagery.  Several bodycam clips were released on Thursday local time, with one showing the moment a police officer was hoisted on the roof before gunman Thomas Crooks attempted to kill Trump on July 13 at a rally in Pennsylvania. The first video from the bodycam does not have audio but the officer can be seen peeking onto the roof and quickly dropping down after spotting Crooks with his AR-15-style rifle. Donald Trump gestures with a bloodied face after an assassination attempt. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Just 40 seconds later, Crooks fired eight shots. He was then killed by a Secret Service sniper.  The incident injured the Republican presidential candidate, killed 50-year-old volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore and left two others critically injured.  When audio was later picked up on the bodycam, the officer who saw Crooks could be heard shouting \"he's straight up\" and asking \"who has eyes on him\".  \"He was right where you picked me up bro\", he continued.  \"He was on that left side.\" Thomas Crooks.\n \n\n\n  (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) At one point after the shots were fired, the officer could be heard shouting \"don't pull up your head, he's right there\" to other law enforcement officers.  Conversation that could be heard over the radio included an officer saying: \"We have two civilians – tending to them. I need an ambulance in the back.\" Near the end of the footage, armed officers are seen scaling the building.  Gunman Thomas Crooks was photographed by local police shortly before he opened fire on Donald Trump.  (Supplied) The footage then cuts to a clip showing the scene on the roof after Crooks was shot dead. His body is seen lying on the roof next to a rifle and a blood trail. The new footage was released after CNN submitted a public record request to Butler Township Police and appealed when they initially refused to release video involving officers or personnel related to the shooting at the rally. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency was reviewing the footage, CNN reported. \"The US Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" he said. \"The attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump was a US Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\" About two hours before the shooting, Crooks flew a drone over the area about 180 metres from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd, and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes. Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter revealed on July 6, he did a Google search for  \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy.\" Crude explosive devices were later recovered from Crooks's car and home. They were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him. The FBI believes he would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices. FBI director Christopher Wray last month said Crooks, 20, searched online for information on the John F Kennedy assassination. \"Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for — quote — 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy','\" Mr Wray told a US House Judiciary Committee. Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated former president Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the Secret Service on July 24, after coming under scrutiny following the assassination attempt. She had told a US congressional oversight hearing that the incident was the agency's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, adding that she took \"full responsibility\".

(Reuters: Tom Brenner) Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are scheduled to debate on US network ABC on September 10. Trump says he wants to debate Harris a total of three times, with the other two debates on Fox and NBC.  Voters in the United States will head to the polls on November 5 to decide who will be the next president. US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Kamala Harris will debate on September 10 on America's ABC, the network has confirmed. Trump also said he wants to add two more debates that month on Fox and NBC. In a rambling news conference at his Palm Beach residence in Florida, Trump said he wanted debates on September 4 and September 25 as well. He did not detail specific terms, such as whether there would be an audience, and it was not immediately clear whether his campaign had made a proposal to Harris's camp. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) The Harris campaign did not immediately comment.  At a campaign event in Detroit, Harris said she was looking forward to the September 10 debate, an NBC reporter said on X. Trump had previously suggested he might back out of the ABC debate, which was scheduled before Harris, the US vice-president, replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate less than three weeks ago, up-ending the contest. Kamala Harris's campaign team says Donald Trump is trying to back out of a debate scheduled to run on a rival network. The news conference was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday. Harris and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has galvanised Democrats. Her rapid rise has sent Trump's team scrambling to recalibrate their strategy and messaging.  Opinion polls show Harris has erased the lead Trump had built over Biden, and Democrats have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors in a matter of weeks. Asked on Thursday, local time, how he has altered his approach to the new challenge from Harris, Trump insisted he has not done so. In a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched beyond an hour, Trump moved from topic to topic, claiming Harris and Walz were weak candidates who were already dropping in the polls. Donald Trump and Joe Biden during the first presidential debate this year. (Getty Images: Andrew Harnik) Despite that, he lamented that he isn't able to face Biden in the election, suggesting that the president was a victim of an unconstitutional plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket. Biden dropped his faltering re-election bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory in the November 5 election after a poor debate performance against Trump. Trump also mocked the size of Harris's campaign crowds, even though they have matched his of late.  He falsely claimed the size of the crowd he addressed on January 6, 2021 – the day his supporters stormed the US Capitol – was as large as those who packed the National Mall in Washington for Dr Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech in 1963. Republicans launch attack lines on Tim Walz to tarnish his image. \"We actually had more people,\" Trump said. \"But I'm ok with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.\" Echoing a recent criticism from his campaign, Trump criticised Harris for not doing a press interview since launching her campaign. \"She can't do an interview. She's barely competent,\" Trump said, later again calling her \"nasty,\" a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics. Trump has conducted a steady stream of media interviews, though they are usually with friendly, right-leaning outlets and reporters.  On Wednesday, he called into the \"Fox & Friends\" morning program and took questions from the program's hosts. Harris and Walz were meeting with auto workers in Detroit on Thursday, following the United Auto Workers union's endorsement of their candidacy, as part of a push to mobilise blue-collar workers in key battleground states. The Harris campaign cancelled events on Thursday in North Carolina and on Friday in Georgia, where Tropical Storm Debby is bringing heavy rain and dangerous flooding.  The Democrats will head to Arizona and Nevada later this week, visiting two more swing states likely to play a key role in the November 5 election. Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also cancelled campaign events in North Carolina on Thursday due to the storm.  He has spent the last few days trailing Harris and Walz around the country, an unusual move intended to provide a \"contrast,\" he told reporters on Wednesday.

(Reuters: Tom Brenner) Donald Trump's campaign says some of its internal communications were hacked, blaming the Iranian government. The campaign did not provide direct evidence and Reuters has not independently verified the identity of the alleged hackers or their motivation. US media outlet CNN had reported last month that the US had intelligence about an Iranian assassination plot against Trump.  Donald Trump's campaign says some of its internal communications were hacked, blaming the Iranian government without providing direct evidence. The campaign of the Republican US presidential candidate sent out a statement shortly after news website Politico revealed it began receiving emails in July from an anonymous source offering authentic documents from inside Trump's operation, including a report about running mate JD Vance's \"potential vulnerabilities\". \"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. Reuters has not independently verified the identity of the alleged hackers or their motivation. The Trump campaign spokesperson said the hack was intended to interfere with the US election.  (Reuters: Tom Brenner) The Trump campaign referred to a Friday report from Microsoft researchers that said Iranian government-linked hackers tried breaking into the account of a \"high-ranking official\" on a US presidential campaign in June.  The hackers had taken over an account belonging to a former political advisor and then used it to target the official, the report said.  That report did not provide further details on the targets' identities. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to name the targeted officials or provide additional details after the report was published. Iran's foreign ministry and its United Nations representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The former president had tense relations with Iran while in office. \n\n  (AP: Matt Rourke) On Friday, in response to Microsoft's findings, Iran's mission to the UN in New York told Reuters that its cyber capabilities were \"defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces\" and that it had no plans to launch cyber attacks. \"The US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere,\" Iran's mission to the UN said. The former president had tense relations with Iran while in office.  Under Trump, the United States killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020 and withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. \"The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\" Mr Cheung said. US officials say a threat from Iran prompted the the Secret Service to boost protection around Donald Trump before Saturday's attempted assassination.  Trump survived an assassination attempt in July.  While there have been no suggestions that the suspect was linked to Iran, CNN reported last month that the US had intelligence about an Iranian plot against Trump.  Iran has denied such charges. Late last month, a senior intelligence official told reporters in a briefing that Tehran and Moscow maintained their same presidential preferences as in past cycles, where Iranian operatives will attempt to tear down the Republican ticket, while Russia has made efforts to smear Democrats, according to prior intelligence community assessments.

Mr Biden says he will be out on the campaign trail for Kamala Harris in the lead up to the November 5 election.  US President Joe Biden has said he dropped out of his bid for re-election amid scrutiny from colleagues who believed he would \"hurt them in the races\" as polling day approached. The 81-year-old gave his first interview since quitting the race, sitting down with CBS News to discuss his legacy, the Harris-Walz ticket, and what will be at stake in November. Kamala Harris is riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, and polls suggest the election has become more competitive. But three months is a long time in modern US politics. Mr Biden announced he would not be running for re-election last month, with Vice-President Kamala Harris now the Democratic candidate. Ms Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. In his interview with CBS, given at his private residence, Mr Biden said if he had stayed in the race, the debate about whether he was up to the job would have been \"a big distraction\". \"Polls we had showed that it was a neck and neck race, it would have been down to the wire,\" he said. \"What happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and the Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races. \"And I was concerned that if I stayed in the race, that would be the big topic. You'd be interviewing me about, 'Why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did so-and-so say,' and I thought it would be a big distraction.\" He noted he had also thought of himself during the 2019 election campaign as a \"transition\" president. \"I thought it was important because although it's a great honour being president, I think I have an obligation to do the most important thing we can do,\" he said. \"And that is that we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\" Mr Biden is set to hit the campaign trail in Pennsylvania and other key states, offering support to Ms Harris and Mr Walz. He said he had \"no serious problem\" despite the poor debate performance which earlier this year sparked concern over his health and suitability for office. Mr Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and had difficulty speaking during the debate against former president Trump in June. But, he told CBS, that issues in the debate were due to illness at the time and that he planned to do \"whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most\". Asked whether he believed there would be a peaceful transfer of power in the aftermath of election day, Mr Biden said he was \"not confident at all\". \"[Trump] means what he says, we don't take him seriously,\" Mr Biden said. \"He means it. All this stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath.' … You can't love the country only when you win. \"Mark my words. If he wins [this election] watch what happens. It's a danger. He's a genuine danger to American security. \"We're in an inflection point in American history, we really are. The decisions we make … in the next three or four years are going to determine what the next six decades look like. \"And democracy is the key.\" The US election will be held on November 5, 2024.

She also called into question former Australian PM Paul Keating's recent comments about China. The US election is in November, with Kamala Harris looking to keep Trump out of the White House. Former US speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi has slammed former Australian prime minister Paul Keating's controversial remarks about Taiwan as \"ridiculous\". Speaking to 7.30 last week Mr Keating described Taiwan as \"Chinese real estate\" and called for Australia to back away from what he deemed a dangerous alliance with the US, especially when it came to the AUKUS agreement. \"You don't want to get my description of him for saying that,\" Ms Pelosi told 7.30 in an exclusive interview. \"That's ridiculous. It is not Chinese real estate, and he should know that Taiwan is Taiwan, and it's the people of Taiwan who have a democracy there.\" Ms Pelosi said that Mr Keating's comments went against the interests of the region. \"I think that was a stupid statement,\" Ms Pelosi told 7.30. \"I don't know what his connection is to China that he would say such a thing, but it is really not in the in the security interest of the Asia Pacific region for people to talk that way. Former prime minister Paul Keating accuses the government of bending to the will of the United States over AUKUS, while defending China's right to its \"real estate\" in Taiwan. \"It may be something he believes, but I think he's wrong.\" Since entering congress in 1987 Ms Pelosi has been outspoken on human rights issues related to China, as well as on the issue of Taiwanese independence. She led a high-profile Congressional delegation to Taipei in 2022. \"We have a history of support for Taiwan for decades in the congress, it's bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans ... and it has been very strong in support of the democracy in Taiwan.\" According to Ms Pelosi, Mr Keating's comments failed to understand the importance of maintaining free shipping routes through the Taiwan Strait. \"This is an economic issue, even if you had no view of the China-Taiwan situation, you know that China cannot tie up the strait there,\" she told 7.30. \"Maybe he isn't aware of that, or doesn't care about that, but that's one of the big motivators for people to be interested in what happens there.\" Mr Keating responded to the comments on Tuesday afternoon in a statement saying: \"Both our countries believe it is in no one's interest for Taiwan to be subject of some sort of violent takeover.  \"This is why I said on 7.30 last week that Chinese and Taiwanese interests will get resolved socially and politically over time.\" Ms Pelosi led the Democrats in the house for 20 years and in a new book, The Art of Power, she recounts her rise within the Democratic Party that was dominated by male leaders. Ms Pelosi says if Donald Trump had have shown up at the US Capitol riots she would have hit him. (AP: Manuel Balce Ceneta/File) None of that history, however, prepared her for Donald Trump. \"Nothing could prepare anybody for a president who would cite an insurrection against the Congress of the United States, in the Capitol of the United States, against the Constitution of the United States,\" Ms Pelosi said. Her memories of the mob which descended on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, the day Joe Biden's election victory was being certified, are painful. \"They brought danger, they brought disgrace,\" Ms Pelosi told 7.30. \"They brought defecation on the floor of the Capitol, the capital of the United States, a symbol of liberty and democracy to the world.  \"They brought Confederate flags under the dome that Lincoln built when he was president of the United States, unifying the country by winning the Civil War. And what they did was completely outrageous.\" The 84-year-old said she would have hit Trump if he had tried to enter the Capitol that day, \"If he came — as a matter of self-defence — I would have to beat him up, and I would probably have to go to jail for beating him up, and that would be OK with me.\" Ms Pelosi and Trump have a history of clashing and she wants to make sure he is never in the White House again. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque/Yuri Gripas) Ms Pelosi holds the Republican leadership in Congress responsible for failing to turn their backs on Trump after the Capitol was attacked. She has also been dealing with the aftermath of the brutal assault on her husband Paul, who was attacked with a hammer by a man who broke into their San Francisco home in October 2022. The intruder was looking for her. \"When it happened, he [Trump], his children, Republican governors, other Republican leaders made fun of it,\" Ms Pelosi said. \"They thought it was really a laugh, they told jokes about it on their social media.  \"That was disgusting, and that was directly from him … he's pathetic.\" Ms Pelosi said that while she accepted she might be targeted with violence as a politician, it was not something the rest of her family signed up for. \"I signed up for this. My husband didn't, my children and my grandchildren didn't,\" Ms Pelosi told 7.30. For Ms Pelosi, her purpose now is ensuring Trump does not win the election in November and return to the White House. Kamala Harris is the woman many Democrats and Ms Pelosi want to see as the next US president. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) She played a pivotal role in the move to encourage Joe Biden to step down as the presidential nominee via a carefully worded statement on US cable news, when it seemed Mr Biden was not budging. She told MSNBC's Morning Joe program: \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\" She told 7.30 she was of the belief that to win the election the Democrats had to change their campaign and the Biden campaign was floundering. \"We weren't on a good track in order to win,\" she said before adding that current Vice-President Kamala Harris had been doing a good job since being endorsed by Mr Biden. \"Kamala took advantage of it like that,\" Ms Pelosi said as she snapped her fingers. \"He endorsed her [and] she ran with the ball, with the grace, the dignity, the political astuteness, the strength of knowledge of the issues [and] the beauty of her faith-filled life.\" For Ms Pelosi, it is imperative that Ms Harris wins the election to unify a fractured United States from the political style of Trump. With Mr Biden stepping down the Democrats need to show a united front behind Ms Harris. (Reuters: Jabin Botsford) \"You have to win to defeat that but to do so in a unifying way,\" she said. \"The Republican Party should take back their party. Their grand old party, did great things for our country, provided great leadership. Now they're a cult to a thug. \"We're not running against Bob Dole, Mitt Romney, George Bush senior, George W Bush. That was a different kind of race where you win, you lose, you negotiate, you go forward.  \"This is something quite different, an assault on the democracy, on the Capitol, on the constitution, on the Congress of the United States.  \"So, we must win that, but we can't become them in the fight.\" Watch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV Do you know more about this story?

(Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes) Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said a cyber attack on his social media platform X affected his scheduled conversation with former president Donald Trump.  Mr Musk said he was working at shutting down the the \"massive DDOS attack\" on X, formerly known as Twitter.  The conversation went ahead with a smaller number of listeners and it was posted on X afterwards. X owner Elon Musk has claimed that a \"massive DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) attack\" on the social media platform affected his interview with former president Donald Trump. The billionaire entrepreneur was due to interview the Republican presidential nominee at 10am AEST, but users ran into issues when trying to access the platform formerly known as Twitter. The site showed that the page was \"not available\" shortly after the scheduled start for some users, though about 214,000 people appeared to have joined successfully. Minutes before the event, Mr Musk posted that he was holding a conversation with Trump, not an interview, adding: \"Nobody is quite themselves in an interview, so it's hard to understand what they're really like.\" \"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X,\" Musk wrote in an X post, referring to a type of cyber attack in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down. \"Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.\" The campaign of the Republican US presidential candidate made the statement, without direct evidence.  He said minutes later: \"We will proceed with the smaller number of concurrent listeners at 8:30 ET and then post the unedited audio immediately thereafter.\" Ahead of the event, Mr Musk had written: \"Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight & tomorrow in advance of the conversation.\" Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Mr Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, citing concerns he would incite violence. He returned to X on Monday morning, local time, for the first time in a year, posting a video highlighting his claim without evidence that the four criminal prosecutions he faces are politically motivated. He quickly followed with a half-dozen other posts, reviving an account that served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and his four years in the White House, including his followers' January 6 attack. The interview finally began after Mr Musk announced they would only let a small number of X users listen in to prevent the system crashing again.  He apologised for the late start and blamed a \"massive attack\" that overwhelmed the company's system. During the wide-ranging chat, Trump recalled his assassination attempt in vivid detail and blamed the incident on \"a lack of coordination\".  On July 13, a man hiding on a nearby roof opened fire at the former president while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was wounded when a bullet tore his ear, but he told Musk the outcome could have been much worse. A would-be assassin wounded Donald Trump by opening fire on his rally in Pennsylvania in July.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) \"If I had not turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now — as much as I like you,\" Trump told X's owner.  The US Secret Service, charged with protecting high level government officials and political candidates, was slammed for not checking locations near the rally for potential shooters. \"There was a lack of coordination,\" Trump said.  \"Everybody understands that building should have been covered.\" Trump said he will return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the scene of the assassination attempt, later in the presidential election campaign.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Social Media US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Dado Ruvic/Illustration) A social media bot network linked to a Chinese university and AI company has been uncovered on X. The information warfare network, dubbed \"Green Cicada\", is one of the largest identified. There are concerns Green Cicada has been staged to disrupt the coming US presidential election. A network of at least 5,000 AI-run accounts has been exposed in a suspected Chinese-run information warfare campaign to spread divisive political discourse on the social media platform X. Local cyber security company CyberCX says it has uncovered an operation linked to a Chinese university and AI company that appears to mainly target contentious American narratives but has sometimes also engaged with Australian content. \"While the information operation capability is currently relatively ineffective, we assess it could be leveraged to conduct harmful activities in future,\" the company warns in a newly completed report. Sample AI-generated profile pictures from X accounts, with pupil placements highlighted.  (Supplied: CyberCX) Researchers believe the cluster of at least 5,000 unauthentic X accounts, dubbed the Green Cicada Network, is almost certainly controlled and coordinated by an artificial intelligence Large Language Model (LLM)-based system. An employee of a Beijing-based AI company who studied at Tsinghua University, which has close links to the People's Liberation Army and Beijing's intelligence apparatus, has been identified as the person likely to have established the emerging operation. \"The network is increasingly engaging in political discourse, but most accounts remain dormant,\" the report states in findings that have already been shared with various federal government agencies. While the Green Cicada Network predominantly engages with US political and cultural issues, it has also been observed amplifying hot-button political issues in Australia, the UK, Western Europe, India, Japan and other democratic countries. \"We observed limited amplification of Australia-specific issues and posting from purportedly Australian personas. Amplified issues include support or opposition to political candidates, nuclear energy, economics, housing, migration, protests and foreign policy,\" CyberCX found. \"Here we have a fake network that is infiltrating our democratic discourse and trying not necessarily to support one side or the other of these debates, but trying to drive a wedge [between] sides of this debate, trying to deepen division and deepen polarisation,\" spokesperson Katherine Mansted said. According to CyberCX, the network \"may plausibly be staged to interfere in the upcoming presidential election,\" with the company saying it has observed it \"improving operational execution over time and sharply increase activity since July 2024\". The cluster of up to 8,000 unauthentic accounts is considered one of the largest publicly exposed to date and may be the first significant China-related information operation to use generative AI at the core of its activities. \"We assess that if the full scale of available accounts were engaged, they could successfully amplify polarising content to sow division and undermine trust in civil institutions,\" the report concludes. A number of the accounts were identified by forcing malfunctions using prompt injections, which override an AI model's original instructions. A number of Green Cicada AI accounts were identified by causing malfunctions using a method known as prompt injection. (CyberCX) Analysis of a cluster of Green Cicada accounts found the account they most frequently engaged with was that of X's owner, Elon Musk.

(ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) It was the evening of June 27 and Les Danielson was out milking the cows on his property in western Wisconsin when he heard something that alarmed him. He was listening in to the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump and it was not going well for the incumbent president. It's hard to believe that was less than two months ago — an eternity in a presidential race that has few comparisons. What the fourth-generation dairy and grain producer heard as he moved from the milking shed to the fields to cut some hay worried him. \"I would have had a hard time, after listening to the debate, voting for Biden,\" he said. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. Here are the key takeaways. \"I was shocked and disappointed.\" If things hadn't turned out the way they did — with Biden eventually standing aside in favour of his vice-president, Kamala Harris — the 54-year-old doesn't know what he would have done come election day on November 5. \"I tend to vote Democratic. I have sometimes not, but tend to vote Democratic, especially on the national level,\" he said. \"But you have to run a candidate that's qualified, and the Democrats weren't.\" Les thinks if Biden had stayed in the race, he might not have voted at all. He's no fan of Trump, the Republican nominee, either. But Les is now one of many Democratic-leaning voters energised by the dramatic turn of events that put Harris on the top of the ticket, with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz chosen as her running mate. \"I really think we have an extremely strong ticket, a very energetic ticket, and a ticket that knows agriculture. So I'm really excited,\" he said. The US election will likely be determined by a handful of swing states — among them, Wisconsin. The Harris campaign overlooked far more famous Democrats for Walz, hoping his folksy charm and Midwestern sensibilities would play well in this crucial corner of the country. Les hails from a well-known local farming family. His two brothers still farm in the area around Cadott. Just a day after Harris announced Walz as her running mate on August 6, the new Democratic duo headed for a campaign rally in Eau Claire, a 20-minute drive from Cadott. After Kamala Harris announced Tim Walz as her running mate, they went to Eau Claire for a campaign rally. (Reuters: Kevin Mohatt) Farmers are an important constituency in Wisconsin, and Les, a member of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, was invited to speak at the rally. \"My story is a Wisconsin story, one of hard work and perseverance, and that's why I'm glad and excited that Vice-President Harris's running mate is a lifelong Midwesterner,\" Les told the crowd. The state is known as \"America's Dairyland\" and is a major producer of butter and cheese. Les got to do the honours of introducing the man of the moment, Walz. The 60-year-old bounded onto the stage, shaking Les's hands and waving at the audience. Sixty is not exactly young, but he exuded energy, cracked a few jokes and made sure the crowd knew he was no stranger to these parts. \"Wow, hello Eau Claire! Isn't it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly,\" Walz said to the delighted crowd. The crowd lapped it up, despite an hours-long wait in the summer heat that saw several faint and have to be carried off over the course of the afternoon. Mike Vandenberg drove for about five hours from his home near the border of Minnesota and North Dakota to attend the event. Minnesota voter Mike Vandenberg says Walz is \"just a real down-to-earth Midwestern guy\". (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) His T-shirt declares him a \"proud Democrat\" but this was his first political rally. \"I'm a huge supporter of my governor,\" he said. \"We're real proud of him. He's just a real down-to-earth Midwestern guy.\" Staring out at the crowd, it does indeed feel like there are a lot of Tim Walzes: middle-aged white men in baseball caps and T-shirts. Walz, it seems, is the Midwestern everyman, who can also appeal to women and younger Americans. \"I like the fact that he is for everything, from marijuana, to allowing women to control their own bodies,\" said Lynne Zimmerman, who attended the rally with her 17-year-old granddaughter Khia. \"We were all kind of depressed when Joe [Biden] was going downhill, and this just revitalised everything.\" Lynne Zimmerman attended the Eau Claire rally with her 17-year-old granddaughter, Khia. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Maurice Hager, a Vietnam veteran and retired iron worker, likes the fact that Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard — a US military reservist force. \"He has done the walk, and being a veteran myself … I'm very proud of who she picked,\" he said. Maurice thinks Harris and Walz together are a good combo. \"It's all about fun, and the other side is very sour,\" he said. Harris and Walz aren't exactly winning anyone over here. This is preaching to the converted. It's a tightly controlled event attended by the party faithful, where Harris and Walz read from the teleprompter a speech almost identical to the one they gave the previous night in Philadelphia. The hope is that these people will be fired up by the rally and motivated to get out and vote in a country where it's not compulsory. Ideally, they'll inspire a couple of people in their lives to vote as well. In swing states, a few thousand votes can be decisive. \"The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin,\" Kamala Harris has said. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Trump took Wisconsin in 2016, beating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by almost 23,000 votes. It was the first time a Republican had won the state in almost three decades. But Biden won Wisconsin back for the Democrats in 2020 — by a margin of 20,000 votes. Now officially a swing state, Wisconsin is predicted to be tight again in 2024. \"The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin,\" Harris told her supporters in July. Recent polling shows her making up some of the ground Biden had begun to cede to Trump, putting her either in a dead heat with her opponent or even slightly ahead in several swing states, including Wisconsin. Either way, any Democratic victory in Wisconsin will not be easy, with many Republican-leaning voters unswayed by the addition of Walz to the ticket. Scott Bischoff, an Eau Claire farmer, is a big fan of Trump. He has several Trump pictures hanging up in his workshop, including one depicting the former president Rocky-style in boxing shorts. Wisconsin farmer Scott Bischoff was initially sceptical of Trump, but now considers himself a supporter. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) The 55-year-old didn't initially warm to the businessman and reality TV star when he first announced he was running for the White House in 2015. \"When I seen him coming down the escalator, I was like, God, you know, this guy is a billionaire from New York … what is he going to care?\" Scott, who grew up in the 1980s, says he still lives like the 80s never ended. He doesn't own a mobile phone or a computer, but he does have cable TV and gets his information from Fox News and, increasingly, from rival network Newsmax. Scott likes what he sees there of Trump's 2024 campaign and he feels he was better off in Trump's first term. \"[He] got our corn prices up, our bean prices [up],\" he said. He blames the current administration for increases in the cost of living. Scott has always voted Republican — his whole family does. Scott Bischoff says he felt that the Trump administration helped him get better prices for corn. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) His brother carved and painted huge wooden letters spelling out Trump and mounted them above one of their fields. Even when the corn is fully grown, you can see it as you drive past. He hopes the chances of Trump winning again are \"100 per cent\". Republicans are also targeting Wisconsin, hoping to turn the state from blue to red in November. They held their convention in the state's biggest city, Milwaukee, in July. And their vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, touched down at Eau Claire while Harris's plane was still on the tarmac. Vance walked over briefly to make a show of inspecting the vice-president's aircraft, named Air Force Two. \"I just wanted to check out my future plane,\" he joked to reporters. Both parties will be back again soon, with small-town America front and centre of the battle for the White House.

(AP: Carolyn Kaster) Donald Trump has insulted how Kamala Harris looks and speaks in a speech to a Pennsylvania rally where he was billed to talk about Republican policies. The former president also claimed she \"will be easier to beat\" than Joe Biden would have been in the upcoming US election. Democrats will kick off their four-day national convention on Monday, which will mark the party's welcoming of Ms Harris as their nominee. Donald Trump used a presidential campaign rally to launch personal attacks on his political adversaries, including declaring three times he was better looking than Vice-President Kamala Harris. Addressing a rally in Pennsylvania's Wilkes-Barre on Saturday, Mr Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron. The former president has seemed to struggle to adjust to Ms Harris, his new opponent, after the Democrats nominated her as their presidential candidate.  \"You don't mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her,\" Mr Trump told his crowd of supporters, after attacking the Democrats for inflation at the top of his speech. As Kamala Harris pulls ahead of the former president in the polls, an increasing number of Republicans are urging their nominee to change tack or risk losing in November.  In multiple campaign appearances over the past week, he has diverged from policies he was billed to speak about and brought into play a rotation of familiar attack lines and insults. Joseph Costello, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, responded to Mr Trump in a statement, saying, \"Another rally, same old show\" and that Trump \"resorts to lies, name-calling, and confused rants\", because he can't sell his agenda. \"The more Americans hear Trump speak, the clearer the choice this November: Vice-President Harris is unifying voters with her positive vision to protect our freedoms, build up the middle class, and move America forward — and Donald Trump is trying to take us backwards.\" Vice-President Kamala Harris will be officially welcomed as the Democrats' nominee at their national convention starting Monday. (AP: LM Otero) Mr Trump's remarks came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention kicking off on Monday in Chicago, which will mark the party's welcoming of Ms Harris as their nominee.  Her replacement of Mr Biden less than four months before the November election has reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition, and presented a new challenge for the Republicans. Mr Trump hammered Ms Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration's inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations.  He has said previously a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger.  On Saturday, asked why she hadn't worked to solve prices when she and Biden were sworn into office in 2021, Mr Trump said: \"Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn't she do it then? So this is day 1,305.\" To address high prices, Mr Trump said he would sign an executive order on his first day sworn in as president \"directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down, but we're going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way\". He predicted financial ruin for the country, and said Pennsylvania in particular would be \"ruined\" if Ms Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process commonly used in the state.  Ms Harris's campaign has tried to soften her stance on the practice, saying she would not ban it, although that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. Mr Trump has a long history of belittling his opponents with jibes. (AP: Laurence Kesterson) Mr Trump laced in attacks on Ms Harris's laugh and said she was \"not a very good wordsmith\" and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Mr Biden in June. Musing on her recent image on the cover of Time magazine, he took issue with a Wall Street Journal columnist remarking earlier this month on Ms Harris's beauty. \"I am much better looking than her,\" Mr Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd.  \"I'm a better looking person than Kamala.\" He also took issue with the way his style is typically portrayed in news reports. \"They will say he's rambling. I don't ramble. I'm a really smart guy.\" In a meandering speech of more than 100 minutes, Mr Trump repeated his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, dismissed the threat of climate change and said his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods would not act as a tax on US consumers, an assertion that most economists contest. Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Mr Trump's upset victory in 2016.  The Saturday rally was his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories in the past two elections owing to support from its white, non-college-educated voter base. Mr Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the state back to the Democrats in 2020. Eight years after the last US election marred by foreign interference, a shadowy figure is offering media organisations access to documents allegedly obtained from former president Donald Trump's re-election campaign. With 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to secure the White House, compared with 15 in Michigan and 10 in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania may be the biggest prize in this year's election and potentially tip the balance for either candidate. Ms Harris's entry into the race last month has up-ended the contest, erasing the lead Mr Trump built in the final weeks of Mr Biden's campaign. She is leading Mr Trump by more than two percentage points in Pennsylvania, according to the poll tracking website FiveThirtyEight. \"I believe she will be easier to beat than him,\" Mr Trump said, referring to the two Democrats, branding Ms Harris a \"radical\" and a \"lunatic\". On Sunday, Ms Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Mr Trump has scheduled a visit on Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Mr Trump's running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day. The battleground states — seen as critical for winning the election — also include Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.

(AP: Julia Nikhinson) The US intelligence community has said that Iran is to blame for the hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The joint statement from the FBI and other federal agencies was the first formal attribution of the hack to a foreign entity, though the Trump campaign had previously said Iran was responsible. They said Iran perceived this year's presidential election to be particularly consequential and was determined through the hacking operation and other activities to interfere in American politics and \"to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions\". The campaign of the Republican US presidential candidate made the statement, without direct evidence.  \"We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,\" said a joint statement from the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The statement said the Iranian hackers have \"sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties\". \"This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign, which the IC attributes to Iran,\" the statement added. \"The IC is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties. \"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process. American news websites reported an anonymous source was offering authentic documents from inside Trump's operation. (AP: Charles Rex Arbogast) \"It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.\" The statement largely confirms the findings of private companies like Microsoft, which earlier this month issued a report detailing foreign agents' attempts to interfere in this year's election.  Eight years after the last US election marred by foreign interference, a shadowy figure is offering media organisations access to documents allegedly obtained from former president Donald Trump's re-election campaign. Google separately said that an Iranian group linked to the country's Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and Trump since May. The FBI has also been investigating attempts to gain access to Democrat Kamala Harris's campaign. Earlier this month, Trump's campaign said the Iranian government was to blame for some of its internal communications being hacked. The claim came after news website Politico revealed it began receiving emails in July from an anonymous source offering authentic documents from inside Trump's operation. \"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said at the time. The FBI then launched an investigation into attempts to hack both presidential campaigns. It comes about eight years after the last US election marred by foreign interference.

Last month, President Joe Biden decided to step aside in favour of his deputy, leaving organisers scrambling to rearrange the event as a celebration of Harris and her new running mate, Tim Walz.  With the formalities already dispensed with in a virtual roll call, Democrats are now holding what is essentially a four-day rally to convince Americans to vote for Harris and Walz over Republican challenger Donald Trump. Day one of the convention was a celebration of the historic nature of Harris's candidacy. She is the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to be the presidential nominee of a major party. Endorsed by a combination of party elders like Hillary Clinton, and fresh faces like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrats appeared united behind Harris. Some national polls suggest the party's gamble of switching from Biden to Harris is paying off, with the Democrat edging out a slight lead over Trump. But this convention is crucial to introducing Harris to a national American audience who will decide her fate in just 76 days. These are the key moments from day one of the DNC. For Harris, the challenge was always going to be making sure Democrats were, as she loves to say, unburdened by what has been. Less than a month ago, Biden was the Democratic presidential nominee. But a catastrophic debate performance against Republican challenger Donald Trump raised questions about his capacity to run again, and he eventually stepped aside in favour of Harris. Still his sitting vice-president, Harris needed to find a way to honour Biden, while unifying Democrats around her as they careen towards Election Day in November. Usually, the nominee doesn't speak until the final day of the convention. But Harris decided to make a surprise appearance on the first day, walking on stage to the tune of Beyonce's Freedom and rapturous applause from the audience. \"Joe, thank you for your historic leadership. We are forever grateful to you,\" she said. \"We will declare as one people, with one voice: we are moving forward.\" It was clearly an emotional night for Biden. The president had to take a tissue from his pocket and dab tears from his face before he even said a word.  His daughter, Ashley, had regaled the crowd with tales about the \"OG girl dad\" before welcoming her father to the stage and embracing him in a hug. After the chants of \"thank you, Joe\" finally quietened, Biden launched into an energetic – and at times angry – speech. While it was relatively free of the signs of diminished capacities that ultimately cost him a shot at re-election, it covered a lot of familiar ground — including many of the anti-Trump themes he repeated in campaign stump speeches before he passed the torch. \"Democracy has delivered, and now democracy must be preserved,\" he said, attacking Trump as a \"loser\". \"This will be the first presidential election since January 6. \"On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country and that threat — this is not hyperbole — that threat is still very much alive.\" Biden declared his best decision of his long career was choosing Kamala Harris as his VP.  \"Crime will keep going down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon,\" he said, and promised to be \"the best volunteer the Harris-Walz campaign has ever seen\". Earlier, First Lady Jill Biden walked onstage to the Fatboy Slim's hit Praise You — a fitting song to set up a speech full of glowing words about her husband. \"Joe and I have been together for almost 50 years, and still there are moments when I fall in love with him all over again,\" she said. One of those moments: \"When I saw him dig deep into his soul and decide to no longer seek re-election and endorse Kamala Harris.\" Hillary Clinton's appearance at the DNC was heady with symbolism. In 2016, her hopes of becoming the first female president were dashed when Trump beat her to the White House. Eight years later, she is back to throw her support behind the next woman running for America's highest office. Dressed in suffragette white, Clinton paid tribute to the Democratic women who came before her, including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to be elected to congress, and Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice-presidential nominee. \"I wish my mother and Kamala's mother could see us,\" Clinton said. \"They would say: 'keep going'.\"  Clinton used her speech to symbolically pass the torch to Harris, saying she will be the one to break through the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" — a riff on her 2008 concession speech when she lost the Democratic primary to Barack Obama. \"This is our time, America,\" Clinton said. \"The future is here. It's in our grasp. Let's go win it.\" Women's rights were a key theme on day one of the convention, with many speakers demanding more reproductive choices after Americans lost their constitutional right to an abortion in 2022. To audible gasps from the crowd, 21-year-old Hadley Duvall spoke of needing an abortion after she was impregnated by her stepfather at the age of 12. \"He calls it a beautiful ban,\" she said of Trump's comments about individual states that changed their abortion access. \"What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?\" Earlier in the day, promised pro-Palestinian protests were staged in Chicago's Union Park, not far from the convention venue. Apart from a small breakaway group that attempted to breach security barriers at the convention, it was entirely peaceful. But with only a couple of thousand people in attendance, it fell short of organisers' expectations, as evidenced by the scores of protest signs that had been produced for the event but sat in piles, unclaimed, in the park. Some might read that as a result of Harris's ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket.  She's seen as more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden was — at least behind the scenes — and there are hopes within the movement that she'd take a different approach to arming Israel than he did. But those hopes are fading. \"She's been our vice-president for the past four years, she supported all of his policies, and based on what she's put out so far, I don't see any change,\" said one protester, Amy Chiang. Nima Homami, who travelled more than six hours from Ohio with a busload of fellow protesters, expressed doubts too. \"I don't know, honestly, if the Democrats will ever listen,\" he said. \"It feels like there's just too much money involved for them to ever listen to what we're saying. \"But I'm hoping, with enough young people, with enough people out here motivated to make a difference, that we might be able to create a political movement that can actually create the kind of change we want to see.\" Another large protest is promised for Friday AEST, the final day of the convention.

By Elissa Steedman Ear bandages were a trendy accessory at the Republican National Convention. At the Democrats' iteration, embellished hats are proving popular. Here's a look at some spotted in the crowd today. By Casey Briggs Away from the convention, there's a significant political story out of the intelligence community today. US intelligence agencies have said Iran is responsible for a hack of the Trump campaign, saying the activity was \"intended to influence the US election process\". The hack came to light last week after several news outlets in the US reported receiving internal campaign documents, including a 271-page dossier on Republican Vice-Presidential candidate JD Vance. The Kamala Harris campaign said it was also warned by the FBI that it had been targeted by hackers. Trump was quick to blame Iran, and now US intelligence agencies including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have concurred. The agencies have put out a joint statement, saying they’re \"confident\" that the Iranians have used social engineering and other techniques to seek access to people involved in both presidential campaigns. They said the activity included \"thefts and disclosures\". \"It is important to note that this approach is not new,\" the agencies said. \"Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.\" By Elissa Steedman In a post to Truth Social, Donald Trump has told followers there will be no debate on September 4. \"Comrade Kamala Harris has just informed us that she will NOT do the FoxNews (sic) Debate on September 4th,\" he wrote. The first debate between Harris and Trump is scheduled for September 10 on the US' ABC News.  Trump has been pushing fora further two debates, which he says would be hosted by Fox News on September 4 and NBC on September 25. But Harris has previously said \"Trump has to show up\" to the ABC debate before she would agree to any further dates. \n NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about setting up a debate between the two vice-presidential nominees, Tim Walz and JD Vance.   By Tessa Flemming   Outside of Chicago, there's been a groundswell of support, especially for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speech. Pod Save America co-host Jon Favreau was among those impressed, with others hinting at her future presidential candidate chances. By Elissa Steedman Does ‘delegate’ mean something different in the States? 🤔 - Sarah They're people chosen to represent their state at their party's convention. A delegate's main job is to decide who will be the party's presidential candidate. At the DNC today, we heard them formally vote to nominate Tim Walz as the party's vice-president candidate. By Elissa Steedman With President Biden finished speaking, that's a wrap on the Democratic National Convention's first day of proceedings. It's currently 11.40pm in Chicago. By Elissa Steedman At the risk of being trivial, what's the attendance like at the convention? I know lots of people are still waiting in line to get in, but is the arena nearly empty? Or is it full? \n\nJust asking because, well, it matters... to only one person... - Ed We don't have official numbers on how many people have walked through the door today. The United Center, where the DNC is being held, has a capacity of about 23,000 for concerts. For reference, here's a shot of the crowd during Hillary Clinton's speech. Around 50,000 people are expected to attend the convention across the week. That includes delegates, elected officials, Democratic Party big wigs and members of the press. By Elissa Steedman Biden told supporters at the DNC they are in a \"battle for the very soul of America\". \"As your president, I've been determined to keep America moving forward, not going back.\" By Elissa Steedman The president has wrapped up his speech at the DNC. He finished by telling the crowd he is \"grateful\". \"I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States senator. I mean it.  \"Folks, we just have to remember who we are: We're the United States of America. \"And there's nothing we can't do if we do it together.\" By Elissa Steedman Biden has moved on from his own record as president to endorsing Kamala Harris. \"For me and Jill, we know Kamala and Doug [Emhoff] are people of character. \"It's been our honour to serve alongside them, and we know that Tim and Gwen Walz are also people of great character. \"Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made …when I became our nominee, and it was the best decision I made my whole career.\" He tells the crowd he and Harris have become close friends and \"she's tough\". \"Kamala and Tim understand that this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities, not just for the few of us, but for all of us. \"I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz have ever seen.\" By North America correspondent Barbara Miller Joe Biden has acknowledged the protestors in Chicago and beyond angry about his staunch support of Israel. Those protestors out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides. He has acknowledged the protestors before, but this feels like a shift in tone. Perhaps the president really feels optimistic that a ceasefire deal is within reach or perhaps he feels he can soften his approach now he is no longer running for re-election. By Elissa Steedman It's a matter of months until Joe Biden's term as president ends but he says he intends to tick off his to-do list. \"Folks, I've got five months left in my presidency.  \"I've got a lot to do. I intend to get it done. \"It's been the honour of my lifetime to serve as your president. \"I love the job but I love my country more.\" By Elissa Steedman Biden has vowed Kamala Harris will \"never\" bow to Putin. \"But when Trump left office, Europe and NATO was in tatters. \"We united Europe like it had been united for years, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO.\" He noted that Russia has not taken Kyiv, three years after it invaded Ukraine. By North America correspondent Barbara Miller There was a moment in the debate that effectively ended Joe Biden's candidacy where Donald Trump and the president got into a spat about golf handicaps. I was reminded of that as Joe Biden boasted just there that he knew more foreign leaders by their first name \"than anyone else alive\". The president then made a joke that it was because he was so old, but it appeared to be a dig at Donald Trump who frequently claims his relations with various leaders including Russia's President Vladimir Putin would mean they wouldn't dare to start wars under his leadership. Joe Biden certainly has had a very long career and has in-depth knowledge of foreign affairs and leaders, but in the weeks after the debate he undermined himself by referring to Ukraine's leader as President Putin, and Kamala Harris as Vice-President Trump. By Elissa Steedman Trump's foreign policy has copped a jab. \"Think of the message he sends around the world when he talks about America being a failing nation.  \"He says we're losing. He's the loser! He's dead wrong! \"Name me a country in the world who doesn't think we're the leading nation in the world.\" Biden managed to insert a bit of levity, telling the crowd he  knows more foreign leaders by their first names. \"[I] know them better than anyone alive. \"Just because I'm so damn old.\" By North America correspondent Barbara Miller Much of this sounds like the stump speech Joe Biden might have given had he still been the nominee. He's talking about the recovery from the pandemic, job growth, and inflation reduction. \"We both know we have more to do but we're moving in the right direction. \"When I say we, I mean Kamala and me.\" The president is nodding to the fact that Kamala Harris has been an integral part of these touted achievements, but a lot of this so far sounds like he's praising himself. By Elissa Steedman Speaking about becoming the first president to walk a picket line, Biden says he's happy to accept he's the most pro-union president in US history. \"I accept it,\" he says. \"It's a fact.\" \"Because when unions do well, we all do well.\" He accuses \"our Republican friends and others\" of prioritising overseas manufacturing for \"the cheapest labour\". By Elissa Steedman Biden is running through a list of his administration's achievements. \"Just think about it: COVID no longer controls our lives. \"We went from an economic crisis to the strongest economy in the world. \"A record 16 million new jobs, record small business growth, record high stock market, wages up, inflation down, way down and continuing to go down, the smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years.\" As the crowd chants, \"Thank you, Joe,\" he insists it should be, \"Thank you, Kamala,\" too.

Just weeks after switching candidates to run against Trump on election day in November, Democrats wanted to paint a picture of unity and joy for voters. Party superstars Barack and Michelle Obama used their speeches to not only endorse Harris, but to call out Trump for what they allege was racist behaviour while they were in the White House. And with the formalities of this event already dispensed with in a virtual roll call earlier this month, organisers decided to hold a dance party instead. These were the biggest moments from day two of the Democratic Convention. The biggest applause of the night was reserved for former first lady Michelle Obama, who has never held elected office, but remains one of the Democratic party's biggest drawcards.  At the 2016 Democratic convention, when Hillary Clinton was facing off against Trump, Obama gave a speech that would become the party's mantra for years to come. \"When someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don't stoop to their level,\" she said. \"No, our motto is: 'When they go low, we go high'.\" Eight years later, with Democrats once again running against Trump, but this time branding him \"weird\" in a popular campaign strategy, all eyes were on the tenor of Obama's speech. Would she continue to encourage Democrats to rise above, or would the gloves finally be off? The answer is — a bit of both. Her speech was a full-throated endorsement of Harris, with Obama declaring that \"hope is making a comeback\". But she also claimed that when her husband Barack Obama was in office, Trump did \"everything in his power to make people fear us\". \"See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who happened to be Black,\" she said to rapturous applause. \"Who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?\" This was a reference to Trump's claim that undocumented immigrants are crossing the border and taking what he described as \"Black jobs\". Obama also warned Democrats that while changing from President Joe Biden to Harris just weeks ago has reinvigorated the campaign, they cannot get complacent. \"No matter how good we feel tonight, or tomorrow, or the next day, this is still going to be an uphill battle, so we cannot be our own worst enemies,\" she said. Former president Barack Obama was the headliner tonight. He was also, in his words, \"the only person stupid enough to speak after Michelle Obama\". Early in his speech, he paid tribute to his \"brother\" and former VP Joe Biden.  He made no mention of the role he's said to have played in the pressure campaign to encourage him to stand down, but praised Biden for \"the rarest thing there is in politics: putting his own ambition aside for the sake of the country\". Obama contrasted this with Trump, who he said \"has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago\".  \"There's the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories,\" he said.  And then he got big laughs when he added that Trump had \"this weird obsession with crowd sizes\".  \"I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbour who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day,\" Obama said.  The roast was well received by the crowd. But when they booed, Obama said: \"do not boo, vote\".  Like his wife did before him, Obama seemed to want to warn against complacency.  \"For all the incredible energy we've been able to generate over the last few weeks, for all the rallies and the memes, this will still be a tight race in a closely divided country.\"  In endorsing Harris, he spoke of the pressure she put him under when she was California's attorney-general and he was in the White House.  \"After the home mortgage crisis, she pushed me and my administration hard to make sure home owners got a fair settlement,\" he said.  For all his pep talking, Obama also had some sober reflections on modern American life.  \"We chase the approval of strangers on our phones,\" he lamented. \"We build all manner of walls and fences around ourselves, and then we wonder why we feel so alone.\" Most Americans did not want to live in a country that had become so bitter and divided, he said.  \"We want something better. We want to be better. And the joy and the excitement that we're seeing around this campaign tells us we're not alone.\" As vice-president, Harris may be famous, but she's not exactly well known by American voters. Day two of the convention was all about introducing her to America, with speeches from her friends and family. Her husband Doug Emhoff and her stepson Cole gave the crowd a glimpse into the blended family they have created together.  \"We might not look like other families in the White House, but we are ready to represent all families in America,\" Cole said. Doug also recalled the early days of his relationship with Harris, recounting the rambling, nervous voicemail he left for her to set up their first date. \"'Hey, it's Doug, I'm on my way to an early meeting. Again, it's, Doug.' I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air, and just put them back in my mouth. And for what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up,\" he said. \"By the way, Kamala saved that voicemail. And she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.\" The Harris campaign has made much of Emhoff's image on social media as a wife-guy, a zaddy, a walking green flag, and a second gentleman who is happy to cede the spotlight to the woman in his life. He has campaigned for Americans to have more abortion access and once said that \"lifting women up so that they can carry out important roles is a very manly thing\". The last woman to get this close to the presidency, Hillary Clinton, sometimes struggled to rein in her husband Bill on the campaign trail. Emhoff, meanwhile, used his speech to stress that he will be cheering his wife on from the sidelines. \"She's ready to lead,\" he said. \"She brings both joy and toughness to this task, and she will be a great president we will all be proud of.\" The traditional \"roll call\", once the formal process to nominate a candidate that the convention was built around, transformed the DNC into a dance party. The real roll call had already been done. Delegates — the people tasked with representing their state party votes for the candidate — took part in an official count online. On Wednesday, a DJ made things more fun. As each state's delegation was invited to pledge their votes from the floor, Grammy nominee DJ Cassidy spun a tune somehow connected with that state, starting with Lynyrd Skynyrd's Sweet Home Alabama. Texas got Beyonce's Texas Hold 'Em, Idaho had The B-52s' Private Idaho and New York, of course, got Empire State of Mind by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. When it was Georgia's turn, Atlanta rapper Lil Jon burst into the arena for a surprise live performance, with some lyrical twists. The words to his hit Get Low were changed from \"to the window, to the wall\" to \"VP Harris, Governor Walz\". Lil Jon wasn't the only celebrity who was part of the party. Actors Sean Astin (Stranger Things), Eva Longoria (Desperate Housewives) and Wendell Pierce (The Wire) joined their state delegations (Indiana, Texas and Louisiana respectively). Earlier in the night, singer Patti LaBelle and rapper Common performed. While things may have looked polished on television on the opening day of the convention, there were some issues behind the scenes. Delegates and guests were stuck on stationary shuttle buses and in long queues outside the venue for hours, thanks to security screening bottlenecks. Inside, too many speakers spoke beyond their assigned times. It forced producers to make programming changes on the run, dumping some content including a performance from singer James Taylor.  But Biden's big speech still started 40 minutes late, pushing it out of television prime-time. In what might be considered some pretty incredible spin, organisers suggested the cause was too much excited cheering. \"Because of the raucous applause interrupting speaker after speaker, we ultimately skipped elements of our program to ensure we could get to President Biden as quickly as possible so that he could speak directly to the American people,\" convention officials said in a statement. DNC executive director Alex Hornbrook said organisers were \"working with our speakers and making some other adjustments\" to keep things on track on Wednesday. The official program began earlier and, even allowing for \"raucous applause\", things seemed to run more smoothly.

Look back on our blog to see how the day's events unfolded. By Elissa Steedman This is where we'll leave our live coverage of the second day of the Democratic National Convention. Here's a quick recap of what happened today: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Elissa Steedman We posted yesterday that embellished hats were a favourite accessory of attendees. Hats are still the trend but today, some DNC-goers have cooked up a theme. By Jessica Riga The former first lady of the United States says Donald Trump attacked her and her husband because they were successful, educated African-Americans. \"For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to make people fear us,\" Michelle Obama said during her speech. \"His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people – who happen to be Black.\" \"I wanna know: who's gonna tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those 'Black jobs'?\" Trump drew heavy criticism last month when he appeared at the National Association of Black Journalists annual convention. \"I will tell you that coming from the border, are millions and millions of people that happen to be taking Black jobs,\" he told the room full of journalists. When asked to define a 'Black job', he said: \"A Black job is anybody that has a job. That's what it is.\" By Elissa Steedman President Biden spoke yesterday. Former Presidents Obama and Clinton and the grandsons of Presidents Kennedy and Carter are also due to speak. By my count the only Democrat President of the last 64 years not to be represented is LBJ. Pretty amazing. - NeilA That's correct. Here are the most recent Democratic presidents, and how they've been represented at the DNC: 2021 - 2025: Joe Biden, spoke yesterday 2009-2017: Barack Obama, spoke today 1993-2001: Bill Clinton, his wife, Hillary, spoke yesterday 1977-1981: Jimmy Carter, his grandson Jason spoke today 1963-1969: Lyndon B Johnson 1961-1963: John F Kennedy, his grandson Jack Schlossberg spoke today By Elissa Steedman There were a few familiar faces among the delegates during the roll call earlier. As we mentioned earlier, Lil Jon popped up to perform during Georgia's vote. A little bit harder to spot is Sean Astin, who you might know as Samwise Gamgee from The Lord of the Rings series, was among the Indiana delegates. You can see him in the photo below, just to the left of the Indiana post with his hands above his head. Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria was among the crowd representing Texas. And we also saw some big names in the Democratic Party, including Gretchen Whitmer and JB Pritzker, whose names were both thrown around as potential running mates for Kamala Harris. By Jessica Riga In case you missed it, Jack Schlossberg (JFK's grandson) spoke at the DNC earlier today, and made sure to capture some #content backstage. He caught up with actor Eva Longoria, who spoke briefly on behalf of Texas delegates during the celebratory roll call. Longoria is a big Democrat supporter and helped open night one of the convention back in 2020. \"Miss you already Eva!!\" Jack wrote. By Elissa Steedman If you missed former president Barack Obama's speech earlier, here's a snippet from his time on stage. By Elissa Steedman Is the night running more on time tonight? I know yesterday went well over  - Rachel Things ran to schedule today. It was well past midnight in parts of the US when President Joe Biden finished speaking yesterday.  So to avoid running late again, organisers planned an earlier start for day two. DNC director Alex Hornbrook told reporters earlier \"we're working with our speakers and making some other adjustments this evening\". By Elissa Steedman We don't have the numbers for today just yet but we know how many television viewers the DNC reached on their first night.  An estimated 20.3 million people in the US tuned in, according to the Nielsen company. That's far exceeded the first night of the Republican National Convention (RNC), which reached 18.3 people.  The main event at the RNC, Trump's first speech after he survived the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, amassed 25.3 million television viewers.  Nielsen tallied the audiences of 13 separate networks that televised the event. Reporting with AP By Elissa Steedman The second day of the DNC has drawn to a close. Day two co-chair Mitch Landrieu has gaveled out the proceedings. \"That was one hell of a night,\" he said. \"I'm bringing this thing to a close!\" By Jessica Riga At one point during his address, Barack Obama responded to audience members who were calling out. \"Yes she can,\" the former president said, nodding his head as he put a spin on his campaign slogan of \"yes we can.\" The arena then filled with a chant of \"yes she can, yes she can.\" \"The torch has been passed,\" Obama said as he endorsed Kamala Harris after paying tribute to Joe Biden's long career. \"Now it is up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in.\" Obama, who spoke after former first lady Michelle Obama, had nothing but praise for the Democratic presidential nominee. \"Kamala Harris is ready for the job. This is a person who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice.\" By Jessica Riga \"If we each do our part over the next 77 days, if we knock on doors, if we make phone calls, if we talk to our friends, if we work like we've never worked before, if we hold firm to our convictions,\" Barack Obama says. \"We will elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States, and Tim Walz as the next vice president of the United States. \"We will elect leaders, up and down the ballot, who will fight for the hopeful, forward looking, America. \"Together we, too, will build a country that is more secure and more just, more equal and more free. \"So let's get to work.\" By Jessica Riga Barack Obama continues his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. \"Our politics have become so polarised these days that all of us across the political spectrum seem so quick to assume the worst in others,\" he says. \"Unless they agree with us on every single issue, we start thinking that the only way to win is to scold and shame and out yell the other side. \"After a while, regular folks just tune out, or they don't bother to vote. \"Now, that approach may work for the politicians who just want attention and thrive on division, but it won't work for us to make progress on the things we care about, the things that really affect people's lives.\" By Jessica Riga \"We should all be proud of the enormous progress that we've made through the Affordable Care Act,\" Barack Obama says. \"Providing millions of people access to affordable coverage, protecting millions more from unscrupulous insurance practices. \"And I noticed, by the way, that since it's become popular, they don't call it Obamacare no more.\" Again, that gets a huge laugh from the audience. By Jessica Riga Obama says vice presidential nominee Tim Walz is \"the kind of person who should be in politics.\" \"Born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, took care of his neighbors. \"He knows who he is, and he knows what's important. \"You can tell those flannel shirts he wears don't come from some political consultant. They come from his closet, and they have been through some stuff.\" By Jessica Riga Former president Barack Obama continues on the topic of Donald Trump. \"He wants you to think that you'll be richer and safer if you just give him the power to put those other people back in their place. \"It is one of the oldest tricks in politics from a guy whose act has, let's face it, gotten pretty stale. \"We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.\" By Jessica Riga Barack Obama has turned his attention to Donald Trump. \"Here's a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago,\" Obama says. \"It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that's actually been getting worse now that he's afraid of losing. \"There's the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes,\" he says, gesturing with his hands, which gets a huge laugh out of the audience. \"The truth is, Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than it means to his ends.\" By Jessica Riga But first, he starts with a little joke about himself. \"It's been 16 years since I had the honour of accepting this party's nomination for president, and I know that's hard to believe, because I have not aged a bit,\" he says. \"And looking back, I can say without question that my first big decision as your nominee turned out to be one of my best, and that was asking Joe Biden to serve by my side as vice president.\" \"History will remember Joe Biden as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger, and I am proud to call him my president, but I am even prouder to call him my friend.\" He pauses as the crowd breaks out into a chant of \"thank you, Joe.\" By Jessica Riga \"I am feeling hopeful, because this convention has always been pretty good to kids with funny names who believe in a country where anything is possible,\" Obama says. \"Because we have a chance to elect someone who has spent her entire life trying to give people the same chances America gave her. \"Someone who sees you and hears you and will get up every single day and fight for you. The next President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris.\" By Elissa Steedman Obama has told the crowd they cannot be their \"own worst enemies\". \"The minute something goes wrong, the minute a lie takes hold, folks, we cannot start wringing our hands, we cannot start getting a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right.  \"We cannot indulge our anxieties about whether this country will elect someone like Kamala instead of doing everything we can to get someone like Kamala elected.\" She has dovetailed back to reflecting on mothers: \"It's up to us to remember what Kamala's mother told her — 'Don't just sit around and complain, do something'!\" That's led to Obama getting the crowd to chant 'do something' back at her.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

By Elissa Steedman As the clock ticks toward midnight in the US, this is where we'll leave our coverage of day three of the Democratic National Convention. Here's a quick recap of what happened today: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Jessica Riga A highlight for viewers wasn't a specific line from Walz, but rather the shots of his son, Gus, crying in the audience and saying \"that's my Dad.\" Here's the moment they hugged on stage after Walz's speech. By Jessica Riga The Democratic Party's vice-presidential nominee was once a coach on a high school football team. In the biggest speech of his political career, Tim Walz went into coach-mode to deliver this pep talk to millions of voters tuning in. By Elissa Steedman In case you missed it, here's the moment Tim Walz formally accepted the Democratic Party nomination for vice-president. He also used his speech to run through the key policies on the Harris-Walz ticket. By Elissa Steedman Coach Walz has finished speaking, which means we've now reached full-time for day three of the Democratic National Convention. The benediction and gavel out are the only items left on the agenda before the delegates, politicians and supporters reconvene for their final day tomorrow. By Jessica Riga \"It's the fourth quarter,\" Tim Walz says passionately on stage at the DNC. \"We're down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the ball, we're driving down the field. \"And boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is top. Kamala Harris is experienced, and Kamala Harris is ready. \"Our job for everyone watching is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling, one inch at a time, one yard at a time, one phone call at a time, one door knock at a time, one $5 donation at a time. \"Look we got 76 days. That's nothing. There will be time to sleep when you're dead. \"We're going to leave it on the field.  \"That's how we'll keep moving forward. That's how we'll turn the page on Donald Trump. \"That's how we're going to fight.\" By Jessica Riga \"She's fought on the side of the American people,\" Tim Walz says. \"She's taken on the predators and fraudsters. She's taken down the transnational gangs, and she stood up to powerful corporate interests. \"She has never hesitated to reach across that aisle if it meant improving your lives, and she's always done it with energy, with passion and with joy.\" By Jessica Riga Tim Walz is now touching on Donald Trump, JD Vance and Project 2025. \"Their project 2025 will make things much, much harder for people who are just trying to live their lives. \"They spent a lot of time pretending they know nothing about this. \"But look, I coached high school football long enough to know, and trust me on this, when somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're going to use it.\" \"I don't know about you, I'm ready to turn the page on these guys, so go ahead say it with me. We're not going back. \"We've got something better to offer the American people. It starts with our candidate, Kamala Harris.\" By Jessica Riga \"Look, I know guns,\" Walz continues. \"I'm a veteran, I'm a hunter, and I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress, and I got the trophies to prove it. \"But I'm also a dad. I believe in the Second Amendment. \"I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.\" By Jessica Riga \"If you've never experienced the hell that is infertility, I guarantee you you know somebody who has,\" Tim Walz tells the DNC. \"And I can remember praying each night for a phone call, the pit in your stomach when the phone had rang, and the absolute agony when we heard the treatments hadn't worked. \"It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments, and when our daughter was born, we named her Hope. \"Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world, and I love you. \"I'm letting you in on how we started a family, because this is a big part about what this election is.\" By Jessica Riga Tim Walz is giving the biggest speech of his career, and taking his time to tell America about his journey. \"Like the rest of my family, I fell in love with teaching. Three out of four of us married teachers. I wound up teaching social studies and coaching football at Mankato West High School. Go Scarlets! \"It was those players and my students who inspired me to run for Congress. They saw in me what I had hoped to instill in them, a commitment to the common good, an understanding that we're all in this together, and the belief that a single person can make a real difference for their neighbors. \"So there I was, a 40-something high school teacher with little kids, zero political experience and no money, running in a deep red district. \"But you know what? Never underestimate a public school teacher.\" By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga Tim Walz has stepped on stage to huge applause. \"It's the honour of my life to accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States,\" he says. \"We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason. We love this country.\" By Elissa Steedman A tutorial on how to change a burnt-out headlight has copped a mention at the DNC. Speaking on Walz's credentials, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said the vice-president candidate's car tips have gone viral. \"In Minnesota, we trust a coach who turned a team that was 0-27 into state champions. \"In Minnesota, we trust a hunter who has stood in a deer stand in 10-degree weather. \"In Minnesota, we trust a candidate who has made a viral video on how to change a burnt-out headlight.\" In case you'd like to see, here's that video. By Jessica Riga Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is about to formally accept the Democratic Party's nomination to be Kamala Harris's running mate. One of his former students, Ben Ingham, spoke on stage earlier. \"All this got me thinking about the kinds of leaders we need,\" Ingham said. \"We want the people in charge to be genuine, compassionate and trustworthy. The thing is, there are people in our neighborhoods who fit this description. \"We always wish that people like that would run for office. Well, in my neighborhood, someone like that did run for office, and he's going to be a wonderful vice president.\" By Elissa Steedman Stevie Wonder addressed the DNC audience ahead of his performance earlier today. He told the crowd to rise above \"hateful division\". \"As we stand between history's pain and tomorrow's courage, we must choose courage over complacency,\" he said. \"It is time to get up and go vote!\" By Elissa Steedman Moving on from swipes at Vance, Buttigieg says he believes in \"a better politics\" than Republicans. \"Right now, the other side is appealing to what is smallest within you. They're telling you that greatness comes from going back to the past. \"They're telling you that anyone different from you is a threat. \"They're telling you your neighbour or nephew or daughter who disagrees with you politically isn't just wrong, but is now the enemy.\"  He says the kind of politics Harris and Walz offer \"feels better to be a part of\". \"There is joy in it, as well as power.\" By Elissa Steedman Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has used a portion of his speech to rubbish statements by Republican vice-president candidate JD Vance. \"At least Mike Pence was polite,\" he says.  \"JD Vance is one of those guys who thinks if you don't live the life that he has in mind for you, then you don't count. \"If you don't have kids, you have no physical commitment to the future of this country.\" Buttigieg waited for the audience to finish its boos before continuing. \"You know, senator, when I was deployed to Afghanistan, I didn't have kids then. Many of the men and women who went outside the wire with me didn't have kids either.  \"But let me tell you: our commitment to the future of this country was pretty damn physical.\" By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke I'd thought nothing would top the enthusiasm unleashed by the double Obama experience last night, but talk show queen Oprah may have just achieved it. She's akin to Chicago royalty and Democrats in attendance ate up all she had to serve despite her admission that she was actually a registered independent. She brought every ounce of her considerable charisma to bear to make the case that Kamala's character make her the obvious choice,  especially given who her opposition is. She treated Trump like Voldemort, never naming him directly. Her leading the crowd in a chant of \"we're not going back\" was a crowning glory even if potentially ear damaging given the decibels involved. By Elissa Steedman Winfrey has wrapped up her speech with a strong endorsement of Kamala Harris. \"We won't go back. We won't be set back, pushed back, bullied back, kicked back. We're not going back. \"So let us choose let us choose truth, let us choose honour and let us choose joy! \"We're all Americans, and together, let's all choose Kamala Harris!\" You can watch her speech in full in the video below.

At one point, he abandoned the protection, stepping off stage to check on a woman in the crowd who needed medical attention. Mr Trump used the event to lob insults at his opponent Kamala Harris as the Democratic National Convention is underway in Chicago. For Donald Trump's first outdoor rally since the assassination attempt last month, the stage was set with a large bulletproof encasing. In the wake of the shooting that left the former president with a bloodied ear, the US Secret Service has put in new protocols, including surrounding the podium with ballistic glass. Storage containers were stacked around the venue in Asheboro, North Carolina, to create additional walls and block sight lines, and snipers were positioned on roofs. New security protocols have been implemented since the attempted assasination last month.  (Reuters: Jonathan Drake) Mr Trump took the stage with a group of suited security personnel. The group shuffled in and out of the glass pen, before Mr Trump launched into his speech.  But he later abandoned the glass caging completely to check on a woman in the crowd who was suffering a medical issue. Accompanied by Secret Service agents, he meandered to the side of the stage towards the cheering crowd. He hugged the woman and then strolled back to the stage as supporters chanted: \"We love Trump! We love Trump!\" The former president, now GOP nominee, used his speech in the battleground state of North Carolina to attack his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris on multiple fronts including jobs and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.  \"All over the world, our adversaries knew that America was not to be trifled with when I was your commander in chief,\" he said. Snipers were positioned on roofs at the venue.  (Reuters: Jonathan Drake) With Ms Harris drawing crowds since replacing Mr Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, the event in Asheboro was a chance for Mr Trump return to staging signature outdoor rallies. Mr Trump has held about a dozen indoor events since he was wounded in an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The attack left one rally participant dead before the 20-year-old gunman was killed by a Secret Service sniper. Multiple shots rang out during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, wounding Mr Trump's ear.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) The Secret Service reportedly recommended that Mr Trump stick to more easily controllable indoor venues such as sports arenas. But he has insisted on continuing his outdoor events. The event, billed as focused on national security issues, was part of Mr Trump's week-long series of counter programming to the Democratic National Convention, which is underway in Chicago. Mr Trump has insisted on continuing outdoor rallies despite the assassination attempt. (Reuters: Jonathan Drake) After some hiccups on the first day, organisers of the Democratic National Convention brought out the big guns for day two: The Obamas and a dance party. Here's what you missed. The second night of the Democrats' convention on Tuesday featured speeches from both Obamas, who went after Mr Trump in particularly biting terms. Barack Obama mocked Mr Trump's obsession with his crowd sizes and called Trump \"a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn't stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago\". \"It's been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that's actually gotten worse now that he's afraid of losing to Kamala,\" the former president said. The Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance joined Mr Trump onstage at the rally. (Reuters: Jonathan Drake) Mr Trump bit back, calling his predecessor's comments \"nasty\". \"He was very nasty last night,\" Mr Trump said. \"I try and be nice to people, you know. But it's a little tough when they get personal.\" Mr Trump has spent the week visiting political battleground states in his busiest week of campaigning since the Republican primaries.

Walz, virtually unknown just weeks ago, delivered a prime-time address in which he slammed Republican challenger Donald Trump, talked about his struggles with infertility, and called for Americans to embrace tolerance and inclusion. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey also made a surprise appearance at the DNC after she was snuck into the convention hall in sunglasses and a face mask. And Bill Clinton and Nancy Pelosi both expressed their joy at witnessing younger Democrats take control of the party they once controlled. These were the big moments from inside the convention hall. A few weeks ago, hardly anyone outside Minnesota knew the name Tim Walz. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz takes the stage on day three of the Democratic National Convention.  (Reuters: Brendan Mcdermid) Now, he has accepted the nomination to be Kamala Harris's running mate at the Democratic National Convention. The Harris campaign is clearly hoping the Governor of Minnesota, who is an enthusiastic hunter and former public school teacher, will help her in parts of the country that might be sceptical about a woman in the White House. Walz, who had two children with his wife Gwen with the help of fertility treatments, used his speech to decry the actions of some Republicans to restrict access to abortion and IVF. \"In Minnesota, we respect our neighbours and the personal choices they make, and even if we wouldn't make those same choices for ourselves, we've got a golden rule: mind your own damn business, and that includes IVF and fertility treatments,\" he said. Walz, a former high school football coach, reached for a sports metaphor as he wrapped up his speech. \"It's the fourth quarter. We're down a field goal, but we're on offence and we've got the ball,\" he said. \"We're driving down the field, and boy do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough, Kamala Harris is experienced, and Kamala Harris is ready.\" Former US president Bill Clinton reportedly tore up the first draft of his speech after watching day one of the convention, with his aides saying he decided it needed more \"joy\" and \"poetry\" to meet the moment. In the end, true to form, he appeared to go off-script anyway, largely ignoring the teleprompter in the second half of his speech.  Bill Clinton paid tribute to the \"joy\" Kamala Harris has brought back to the Democratic party.  (AP: Erin Hooley) But he had some zingers prepared.  And he stuck with the attack line that's been central to the Democrats' message through the convention: that Trump only wants to be president to serve himself.  \"He's like one of those tenors opening up before he walks out on stage, like I did, trying to get his lungs open by singing 'me, me, me, me, me',\" Clinton said.  \"When Kamala Harris is president, every day will begin with you, you, you, you.\" Age is no longer a taboo topic for Democrats.  Clinton — who said his first convention was in 1976 before realising it was four years earlier and correcting himself — was more than willing to go there.  Former US President Bill Clinton was back in his element — in front of an applauding crowd.  (Reuters: Brendan Mcdermid) \"Two days ago, I turned 78. The oldest man in my family of four generations,\" he said.  \"And the only personal vanity I want to assert is I'm still younger than Donald Trump.\" But, like the Obamas on Wednesday, he warned against complacency. \"We've seen more than one election slip away from us when we thought it couldn't happen,\" he said.  Whispers of a surprise Oprah Winfrey appearance started whipping through the convention hall early in the day.  She'd tried to keep her presence under wraps by wearing a hat, sunglasses and face mask during rehearsal, her best friend Gayle King reported on CBS.  When she finally came out on the stage, she was met with thunderous applause. The media mogul's political endorsement is hugely powerful in America. Oprah Winfrey's endorsement is potent in US politics.  (Reuters: Mike Segar) When she backed Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008, she helped put him on the television screens of middle-class American voters around the country. On Thursday night, Winfrey offered Harris her enthusiastic endorsement.  And she delivered a prime-time message, with all her usual talk-show host charisma, that was designed to reach beyond rusted-on Democrats and persuade undecided voters. \"There's a certain candidate that says if we just go to the polls this one time, that we'll never have to do it again,\" she said.  \"Well, you know what you're looking at? A registered independent [voter] who's proud to vote again and again and again, because I'm an American, and that's what Americans do.\" She did not mention Trump by name, but said Americans were \"beyond ridiculous tweets and lies and foolery\", and were not as divided as some people would have them think.  \"When a house is on fire, we don't ask about the home owner's race or religion. We don't wonder who their partner is or how they voted.  \"No, we just try to do the best we can to save them.\" And, in a reference to resurfaced 2021 comments made by Trump's running mate JD Vance, she added: \"if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too.\" If it weren't for Nancy Pelosi, this might have been a very different Democratic National Convention. While President Joe Biden's decision to step aside in the wake of his disastrous debate against Trump came after weeks of party pressure and relentless media coverage, Pelosi is believed to have played a key role behind the scenes. The former house speaker and party elder reportedly made clear to Biden \"that they could do this the easy way or the hard way\" in the days before he made way for Harris. When asked by CNN if her manoeuvring has left any \"residual bad blood,\" between her and Biden, she laughed it off. \"Sometimes you just have to take a punch for the children,\" she said. But when she walked onto the stage to huge applause, you would never know the weeks of turmoil that preceded this convention. \"Thank you Joe! I know Kamala Harris will take us to new heights,\" she said before pivoting to a fiery warning about the insurrection on January 6, 2021. Nancy Pelosi reportedly played a key role in pressuring Joe Biden to step aside for Kamala Harris.  (Reuters: Mike Segar) Pelosi, like hundreds of other members of congress sheltered in safe rooms when Trump supporters broke into the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the outcome of the election. \"The parable of January 6 reminds us that our democracy is only as strong as the courage and commitment of those entrusted with its care, and we must choose leaders who believe in free and fair elections, who respect the peaceful transfer of power,\" she said. \"The choice couldn't be clearer.\" Pete Buttigieg is considered a rising star of the Democratic party — and one of their best communicators — so it's no surprise he was reserved a prime-time slot on day three of the DNC. The 42-year-old is Biden's transportation secretary and is father to twins with his husband, Chasten. One of the few Democrats willing to go on the conservative network Fox News, he regularly goes viral for his effortless putdowns, spicy barbs and real-time fact checking. \"Here's a sentence I never thought myself saying,\" he said to open his speech. \"I'm Pete Buttigieg and you might recognise me from Fox News.\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg lashed out at JD Vance for his comments on family.  (Reuters: Brendan Mcdermid) But he used the rest of his address to talk about inclusion and tolerance. As a gay man who started his family through the help of IVF and surrogacy, he hit out at Trump's running mate JD Vance for his previous comments on fertility and family. \"Don't even get me started on his new running mate. At least Mike Pence was polite. JD Vance is one of those guys who thinks if you don't live the life that he has in mind for you, then you don't count,\" he said. \"Someone who said that if you don't have kids, you have 'no physical commitment to the future of this country'. You know, senator, when I deployed to Afghanistan, I didn't have kids. \"Then, many of the men and women who tied the wire with me didn't have kids either, but let me tell you, our commitment to the future of this country was pretty damn physical.\" Friday is the last day of the Democratic convention, with Kamala Harris slated to make her big speech to accept the nomination to run against Trump in November.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Political Leadership US Elections US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Look back on our blog to see how the day's events unfolded. By Elissa Steedman That's all from the Democratic National Convention for another four years. This is where we'll leave our live coverage. Here's a quick recap of what happened today: You can take a look back at all the developments below, or read more about the key takeaways from the day here.  By Jessica Riga By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff have stopped by an after-party inside the arena. According to the reporters who are travelling with the vice-president, she told the crowd gathered there that Democrats could win the election. “But only if we understand you can party tonight and you need to work for the next 75 days or so,\" she said. Harris is working to a very tight timeframe. It's only been just over a month since Joe Biden dropped out of the race. And while the election is in November, early voting in some states opens up within weeks. By Jessica Riga By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania The uncommitted delegates, who made it inside the venue after ending their sit-in protest, say they'll keep fighting for their cause inside their party. Earlier, they staged a 24-hour sit-in outside the stadium after being denied a speaking slot for a Palestinian American onstage. The National Uncommitted Movement is now demanding Kamala Harris meet with members to discuss an arms embargo on Israel by September 15. (They have not spelled out what they will do if she doesn't.) \"We're not going anywhere,\" said Jeremiah Ellis, an uncommitted Minnesota delegate. \"We're not going to accept rejection. We're long time party activists. We're long time community organisers. We know how to mobilise. We know how to push an issue forward.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Kamala Harris gave a brief thank you to Joe Biden but this was very much a speech focussed on her own story.  The vice-president has spent years in national politics as a senator and Biden’s deputy but she's never had an opportunity quite like this to introduce herself to voters.   She pitched herself a product of a middle class upbringing, the child of immigrants who was taught to believe that she could achieve anything she put her mind to.   She didn't explicitly point to the fact that she would become America’s first ever female president, if elected, but she didn’t have to. From the women wearing suffragette white in the stands, to the speakers that came before her, the historic nature of her campaign was obvious.   It’s impossible to know how different the atmosphere would have been in Chicago had Joe Biden still been the Democratic nominee.   But Harris delivered a forceful, energetic address in a way that Biden often struggled to.   The party faithful have rallied around Harris in the month since the president dropped out. The excitement in Chicago all week is testament to that.  But Harris needs broader support if she’s going to beat Donald Trump in November.   And she’s going to continue to face pressure to go beyond scripted speeches like this one and answer questions about her record in office and her vision for America.   In a contest that has changed so much, so quickly, in recent weeks, two and a half months could feel like a very long time. By Jessica Riga The Beyhive was abuzz with anticipation, but the 2024 Democratic National Convention has just officially come to a close without a single sighting of Beyoncé. Tabloid site TMZ ran a story earlier about her appearance, citing \"several sources\" who confirmed Queen Bey would be the \"big surprise performer\". Since Kamala Harris's campaign song is Freedom from Beyoncé's Lemonade album, it was entirely possible the 32-time Grammy Award-winner would hit the stage! But it wasn't meant to be. By Jessica Riga By Elissa Steedman Harris is delivering the final comments in her keynote address. \"So let's get out there,\" she says. \"Let's fight for it. Let's get out there. Let's vote for it, and together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Kamala Harris is addressing an issue that Donald Trump considers to be one of her biggest policy weaknesses: immigration.  The former president has made illegal crossings at the US southern border a major focus of his campaign.  He’s attacked Harris’s work on the issue in the early days of her vice-presidency, criticising her as a failed “border czar”, and chose today to make a visit to a border community.   Republicans have blamed the Biden administration for an historic rise in the number of people crossing the border in recent years, although numbers have since come down.   Harris didn’t spend much time on the issue but tried to shift blame back onto Trump - accusing him of deliberately sinking a bipartisan bill that would have gone some way to addressing it. By Elissa Steedman Kamala Harris touches on the unity theme we've seen so much of in the past few days. \"I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world: that here in this country, anything is possible that nothing is out of reach an America. \"Where we care for one another, look out for one another and recognise that we have so much more in common than what separates us,  that none of us, has to fail for all of us to succeed, and that in unity there is strength.  \"You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day, denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: never let anyone tell you who you are, you show them who you are. \"America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for, freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities.\" By Jessica Riga Kamala Harris says will \"never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran backed terrorists.\" \"I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump. \"Because they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. \"And as President, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs.\" By Jessica Riga Kamala Harris has called for a ceasefire deal in the Israel-Gaza war, telling the DNC that \"the scale of suffering is heartbreaking.\" \"With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done,\" Harris says. \"And let me be clear,  I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself. \"Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organisation called Hamas caused on October 7, including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. \"At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost, desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. \"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.\" By Elissa Steedman On foreign policy, Kamala Harris has promised she will be \"steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad\". \"As Vice President, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances and engaged with our brave troops overseas,\" she says. \"As Commander in Chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. \"I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. \"I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence, that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century, and that we strengthen, not abdicate our global leadership.\" By Jessica Riga \"Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,\" Kamala Harris says. \"But tonight in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. \"And let's be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump hand picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. \"And now he brags about it in his words. Quote, 'I did it, and I'm proud to have done it.' \"And understand he is not done as a part of his agenda. He and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. \"And get this: he plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. \"Simply put, they are out of their minds.\" This last line gets huge applause from the crowd. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan The Democratic Party has a new slogan: \"We're not going back\".  It’s been used so often at this convention that the crowd here almost preempted Kamala Harris in chanting the phrase as she was about to deliver it.   Democrats are using the line to argue against sending Donald Trump back to the White House.   It’s also possibly a nod to the historic nature of Kamala Harris’s campaign. If elected, she’ll become America’s first ever female president. By Elissa Steedman Harris is leaning on her middle class upbringing to appeal to everyday Americans. \"This is personal for me, she says. \"The middle class is where I come from. \"My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little, and she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. \"That's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed, whether you live in a rural area, small town or big city. \"As President, I will bring together labor and workers and small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries.  \"We will provide access to capital for small business owners and entrepreneurs and founders, and we will end America's housing shortage.\" By North America correspondent Barbara Miller Donald Trump is one of millions of Americans tuning into this primetime address. The former president is posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, lambasting the Vice-President for spending so long telling her story. Kamala's biography won't lower prices at the Grocery Store, or at the Pump! He's also using the platform to criticise Harris's running mate, Tim Walz. Walz was an ASSISTANT Coach, not a COACH. By Jessica Riga Kamala Harris has told the Democratic National Convention that America is in \"a fight for our future.\" \"This election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation,\" she says. \"Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. \"Consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election.\" \"Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol. \"Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States, not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself.\" By Elissa Steedman Harris is promising she would be a president for \"all Americans\". \"You can always trust me to put country above party and self, to hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power,\" she says. \"I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations, a president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical and has common sense and always fights for the American people, from the courthouse to the White House — that has been my life's work.\"  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Every time a speaker walked off the stage and the MC prepared to announce the next guest, a hush fell over the crowd. In the end, Bey's appearance never eventuated.  But the star of the night was still Harris, who had just weeks to prepare to make her pitch to the American people to vote for her as their first female president. In a wide-ranging speech that touched on thorny foreign policy issues like wars in Ukraine and Gaza, abortion access and climate change, Harris sought to distinguish herself from her opponent. These were the biggest moments from the last day of the Democratic National Convention. Kamala Harris had to walk a startlingly high tightrope in her address to accept the nomination to be the Democratic nominee. Only a month ago, she was President Joe Biden's running mate, but his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June saw her rocketed to the top of the ticket. Most presidential contenders have months, if not years, to write, practice and perfect their convention speech. Harris had just a couple of weeks. She used this convention to introduce herself to the American people, who might know her as Biden's VP, but don't know much else. Her young nieces came on stage to teach the crowd how to correctly say her name, and her sister Maya gave insights into their childhood as the daughters of immigrants living in California in the 1960s.  Finally, it was Harris's turn to speak to the delegates.  She wished her husband Doug a happy anniversary, paid tribute to her late mother, and took a moment to honour the historic nature of her candidacy. She is the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to be the presidential nominee of a major party. \"So, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks … I accept your nomination for president of the United States of America,\" she said. In attacking Trump, Harris steered clear of the \"weird\" attack line that Democrats have favoured since her running mate, Tim Walz, started trotting it out in media interviews. Instead, she reverted to the party's longstanding tack, painting him as a danger to democracy. She talked about his efforts to reverse Biden's election win, his plans to pardon January 6 rioters, and the civil fraud and sexual abuse rulings against him. The threat he posed, she said, had been heightened by the recent Supreme Court decision granting ex-presidents some immunity from criminal prosecution. \"Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States,\" Harris said. \"Not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself.\" Harris tore into Trump on both domestic and foreign policy. She insisted Trump \"and his allies\" would enact a nationwide abortion ban, despite Trump's insistence he would leave it to states to decide Trump has changed his public position on abortion over time, but recently has been saying he would leave it up to individual states. And she said dictators like North Korea's Kim Jong-un were \"rooting for Trump\". \"Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.\" The will-she-won't-she speculation about a final-night Beyoncé cameo had been building all week. Her hit Freedom has become the Harris campaign anthem, with Beyoncé's blessing, and an a capella version of the song blasted through the stadium speakers on night one. Speculation reached a fever pitch when White House political director Emmy Ruiz posted a bee emoji on X, formerly known as Twitter.  For the uninitiated, Beyoncé's fans call themselves the \"Bey-hive\".  Twitter users were unconvinced when Ruiz then posted, \"Sorry guys my 6-year-old took my phone\".  Whether it was an out-of-control rumour or a story planted to get more Americans to tune in on the final night of the convention, the arena was disappointed.  Some other stars lent their power to the Kamala cause though.  P!ink did an acoustic version of What About Us, a ballad that she has called a political protest song, with her daughter Willow. The Chicks returned as well. In 2003, back when they were known as The Dixie Chicks, they were cancelled by the country music industry for speaking out against the Iraq war and criticising George W Bush. In 2020, they performed the national anthem at the Democrats' virtual convention, and reprised their performance for the crowd tonight. In the weeks leading up to the convention, the DNC had been under pressure to make space onstage for a pro-Palestinian voice. The collective of uncommitted delegates, representing hundreds of thousands of protest votes in their states, had for weeks been requesting a speaking slot for a Palestinian American. \"The DNC kept telling us that they would get back to us, and they were working on it, and to be patient,\" Asma Mohammed, an uncommitted Minnesota delegate, told the ABC. \"And finally, yesterday, at 8pm they told us the answer was no.\" Some of the delegates responded by staging a 24-hour sit-in protest just outside the main convention arena, sleeping on the concrete overnight. Palestinian American Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib came to see them and offer support, and fellow 'Squad' Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez FaceTimed the group and called on the DNC to change its mind. The DNC didn't comment on its decision, but party elder Nancy Pelosi said AOC could have spoken about the issue in her speech, and added: \"We don't have every nationality in our country speak at a convention.\" In the end, the first Muslim member of the Georgia state legislature, Ruwa Romman, gave her speech at a press conference outside.  She spoke of her family's Palestinian roots and their pain over what was happening in Gaza, but didn't criticise the Biden administration.  She ended it by saying: \"To those who doubt us, to the cynics and the naysayers, I say, 'Yes, we can'.\" \"Yes we can be a Democratic Party that prioritises funding our schools and hospitals, not for endless wars. That fights for an America that belongs to all of us. \"Black, brown and white, Jews and Palestinians, all of us, like my grandfather taught me, together.\" During her speech, Harris addressed the war in Gaza.  “With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done,” she said. She spoke forcefully against Hamas and the terrorist attack on Israel on October 7.  \"At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost, desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again, the scale of suffering is heartbreaking,\" she said, earning her one of the loudest cheers of the night from the crowd.  While Democrats partied in Chicago, Trump flew south to Arizona's border with Mexico to talk about immigration. Polls show that border security is one area where voters overwhelmingly prefer Trump. One poll this year showed Americans preferred his immigration stance over Biden's by more than 30 points. The decision to switch out Biden for Harris has improved Democrats' standing with voters on immigration. But it's clearly one area where Trump thinks he has an advantage. In Arizona, he threatened large tariffs on countries that don't accept deported migrants. \"The countries will accept them back, and if they don't accept them back, we do no trade with those countries and we charge them big tariffs,\" he said. With the Democratic Convention now done, we are full steam ahead towards election day on November 5. Most polls show the decision to dispense with Biden in favour of Harris has given Democrats a better chance against Trump, with the election a toss-up if it were held today. The next key date to look out for is September 10. That's when Harris and Trump will face off in their first televised presidential debate.

(Getty: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) When the bullets started flying at Butler Farm Showgrounds in Pennsylvania last month, it wasn't the US Secret Service that saved Donald Trump's life. It was luck. The former US president and 2024 Republican presidential candidate turned his head just as the first bullet whizzed past, meaning it grazed his ear, instead of much more serious consequences. \"[The Secret Service] is very good at what it does, and so for this to have gone so badly wrong was a big surprise to me,\" retired FBI special agent Kenneth Gray tells ABC RN's Rear Vision. But it's not the first time the Secret Service — whose most consequential job is protecting US political leaders — has failed. And with this year's presidential election campaign reaching fever pitch, there is immense pressure on the agency to once again learn from its mistakes. The Secret Service was established in 1865 under the US Department of the Treasury, with the main aim of investigating and stopping counterfeit money. \"After the Civil War, a lot of the currency in circulation was counterfeit, up to a third of it,\" says Gray, who is now with the University of New Haven. But in 1901, president William McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, and the US Congress tasked the Secret Service with protecting the president. The Secret Service protects then-president Theodore Roosevelt in 1905. (Library of Congress) Today, the Secret Service is part of the US Department of Homeland Security. The agency protects US political leaders, their families and visiting dignitaries, and, true to its roots, still investigates financial crimes. Secret Service special agents have become a familiar sight in the US political arena — in their famous suits and earpieces, they are men and women willing to lay down their lives for those they serve. In 1963, president John F Kennedy was visiting Dallas, Texas. The 46-year-old Democrat had been in power for almost three years, and had come to Texas to help soothe some intra-party fighting. It was also a soft launch of his 1964 re-election campaign. But as Kennedy's motorcade drove through Dealey Plaza, he was shot. He died about 30 minutes later in hospital. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested and charged with the assassination but was fatally shot days later. JFK rides through Dallas moments before he was shot. (Reuters) The killing of president Kennedy had a profound impact on the Secret Service. The Warren Commission was set up to investigate what happened. It found that many of the agency's procedures weren't adequate for a president like JFK, who loved being in the middle of big crowds. \"Each time there is an attempted or a successful assassination, the Secret Service learns from that and changes their process of doing protection details,\" Gray says. \"[For example], JFK was in an open vehicle … So after that occurred, they didn't have any more open-air vehicles being used.\" In addition, no-one thought to thoroughly check or have security stationed in the buildings along the motorcade route, and there weren't any formal procedures for working with local police — all of which have since changed. There were also only a few dozen agents on the ground in Dallas at the time JFK was shot. So afterwards, the Secret Service got more money to recruit and expand its operations. In 1975, president Gerald Ford was targeted by two separate would-be assassins within a few weeks. Rear Vision puts contemporary events in their historical context, answering the question: \"How did it come to this?\" On September 5, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme from the Manson Family cult unsuccessfully attempted to shoot him in Sacramento. Then on September 22, Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at Ford outside a hotel in San Francisco. Both missed. Former special agent Robert McDonald spent 21 years with the Secret Service, including working the security detail for presidents. He says one big change after the Ford events was around the doors of any car or plane waiting for a president. \"The agents couldn't get the door of the limousine open [for Ford to get in] … [So now] whenever you see the president getting out of the vehicle or heading to the vehicle, that door is already open,\" he says. He says every event like this \"has been a building block\" of how the Secret Service works. In March 1981, Ronald Reagan — the movie star-turned-governor-turned-president — gave a speech at the Washington Hilton. As Reagan was leaving the event and walking towards his motorcade, he was shot by John Hinckley Jr. Ronald Reagan leaving the Washington Hilton after his speech. (White House Photographic Collection via National Archives) Secret Service agent Jerry Parr managed to bundle Reagan into his presidential limousine and ensured that he was immediately driven to a nearby hospital, instead of back to the White House. The Republican president was seriously wounded but recovered. Two others were injured and one, press secretary James Brady, died as a result of his wounds years later. Chaos at the Washington Hilton after Ronald Reagan and others were shot. (White House Photographic Collection via National Archives) At the time, Bill Gage was a young boy and he vividly remembers seeing the news of the assassination attempt on TV. \"Seeing the guys in suits, throwing themselves in front of the bullets, and then asking my dad, 'Hey, who are those guys?' … My dad said, 'That's the Secret Service',\" he says. \"I knew then that that's what I wanted to do.\" Years later, Gage became a Secret Service special agent, and he's never forgotten the actions of Jerry Parr. \"A doctor said Reagan only had a few minutes to live if he did not get medical treatment. Jerry Parr saved Reagan's life,\" he says. So what exactly went wrong that day? There had been a screening process for those attending Reagan's speech inside the hotel, but after pressure from the White House, an unscreened group of people was also allowed to stand outside the venue. This included the shooter, John Hinckley Jr. \"The main lesson learned from the Ronald Reagan shooting, I believe, was don't let the White House overrule your plan of making sure that a threat doesn't get close to the president like that,\" Gray says. And in the decades since, the Secret Service has meticulously prepared for high-stakes events. For example, Robert McDonald spent 16 months living in Hawaii planning for a two-day APEC summit in 2011. \"We had to procure hotel rooms. We had to fly in all of the armoured limousines. We had to figure out with our military partners how to protect Waikiki from any trouble. It was a very arduous assignment.\" But that doesn't mean every event is watertight. Multiple things went wrong on the day of the Trump attempted assassination — from placement of people to communication errors. Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don’t need to be a scientist to find it! Questions have been raised about the advance work done by Secret Service agents in the lead-up to the rally. \"Those are the agents that come in ahead of time and put the security apparatus and plan together. They prepare it, they review it, they brief it, they bless it, they supervise it, they implement it,\" McDonald says. \"That's where [the Secret Service] really made some tough errors that are going to have to be dealt with, and some people are going to have to be held accountable.\" The Secret Service partly relies on local law enforcement to help secure venues.  Gray says on this occasion, the Secret Service assumed that local snipers would protect the warehouse roof where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks fired his shots. But these snipers were actually stationed inside an adjacent building — a plan which would have been approved by someone in the Secret Service. Crooks was initially identified by local police as acting suspiciously, but then he was lost in the crowd. \"A [local police] team responsible for the protection of former president Trump from that building had left their post, because they were trying to grab this guy. So that was the major flaw,\" Gray explains. By the time Crooks was located by local police, he was on the roof and about to take aim at Trump. Once the shots were fired, a Secret Service sniper killed Crooks within seconds. The Secret Service is in a period of soul-searching after the Trump shooting. (AP: Evan Vucci) The fallout for the Secret Service has already been severe. At a US congressional oversight hearing, director Kimberly Cheatle failed to answer basic questions about the event and was forced to resign days later. All of this and more will be scrutinised as part of several investigations, which have now been opened. The US presidential election is still months away, which means there will be much more crisscrossing the country and campaigning for Trump and his new Democratic rival Kamala Harris. So will the attempted assassination change how events are run? \"If [former] president Trump continues to decide to do outdoor rallies, there won't be a roof within a mile of that rally that won't be covered,\" McDonald says. And there are already changes afoot. This week, Trump held his first outdoor rally since the shooting, behind a large bulletproof encasing. But Cheryl Tyler, the first black woman to be assigned to the Presidential Protective Division of the Secret Service, thinks a similar style of campaigning will continue. \"Politicians in the United States have to press the flesh. They want to meet the people,\" she says. \"[And] people are now saying, 'You shouldn't do outdoor events'. Well, I'm sorry, that's never going to happen in American politics.\" She says there will be more negotiating between the Secret Service and campaign teams on how this can be done as safely as possible. A member of the Secret Service looks on at a recent campaign event. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) McDonald adds that there may be bigger changes made in the future. \"[The Secret Service] is investigating a lot of different things and maybe it ought to trim that list down,\" he says. \"I just think that [the agency] might need to utilise this incident as a chance to reboot, to reset its priorities.\" In other words, putting more time, effort and resources into its most high-stakes job: Protecting US political leaders.

The US intelligence community blamed Iranian actors this week for the hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Vice-President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign also stated it had been the target of foreign hackers. Other agencies, including social media giant Meta and Microsoft's threat intelligence body, have warned of an increase in election interference as voting day approaches. But the methods and motives of these increasing attacks vary from nation to nation. Iranian actors believe this year's election to be \"particularly consequential\" in terms of their potential impact, according to the intelligence community. A joint statement by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency accused Iran of seeking to \"stoke discord\".  Their statement also noted that \"social engineering\", and \"thefts and disclosures\" form part of those efforts.  The joint statement from the FBI and other federal agencies was the first formal attribution of the hack to a foreign entity. \"Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to US elections,\" their statement said.  \"It is important to note that this approach is not new.  \"Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in countries around the world.\"  Iran has denied involvement and labelled the intelligence report \"unsubstantiated\".  Monash University's Emma Briant is an expert on propaganda and information warfare.  \"[Countries] have different kinds of specialisations and technologies that they have honed, but there is also the different strategic interests at stake,\" Dr Briant said.  \"In the Iran case at the moment, whichever direction the election goes in isn't necessarily going to change the situation of Israel and Palestine.  \"What they're mostly keen to do is [to] exploit whatever happens in the election. \"They want to exploit the outcome and cause divisions and drive protest, anger, divisive discourses online that support the destabilisation of the United States.\"  Iranian activity has driven a recent uptick in \"foreign malign influence\", according to Microsoft Threat Intelligence's recent report released earlier this month. \"Over the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,\" the report said. \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles. \"Iran's operations have been notable and distinguishable for appearing later in the election season and employing cyber attacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\" Nalin Arachchilage, an associate professor in cyber security at RMIT University, said the report \"clearly articulated\" that each nation was using a different strategy for its own objectives. \"Iran focuses on amplifying social issues and distracting trust,\" he said.  \"Whereas Russia engages in creating sensational disinformation, perhaps through fake news disseminated across the social media platforms.  \"China has a different perspective to this. They use political content and protests organised through social media to manipulate public opinion.  \"The common thing we can see in this process is that they're using social media platforms [and] messaging services to break into people's mindset and change their opinion.\"  In recent months, Russian actors have also been accused of attempting to influence the election outcome. Voices sympathetic to Russia are posing as fact-checkers in a bid to sow doubt and confusion, and to drain sympathy from a world watching the invasion of Ukraine. The latest threat report released by Meta noted a \"deceptive campaign from Russia\" that involved posting fake news stories and uploading AI-generated news content to YouTube. \"They also ran fictitious journalist personas, each with consistent profile photos across the internet,\" Meta's report said, adding it was a trend they had been \"monitoring since 2019\".  \"Russia remains the number one source of global [coordinated in-authentic behaviour] (CIB) networks we've disrupted to date since 2017, with 39 covert influence operations. \"The next most frequent sources of foreign interference are Iran, with 30 CIB networks, and China, with 11.\" Russia-based operations, according to Meta, are expected to share positive stories for election candidates \"who oppose aid to Ukraine\", and \"criticise those who advocate\" for Ukraine. \"This could take the shape of blaming economic hardships in the US on providing financial help to Ukraine, painting Ukraine's government as unreliable, or amplifying voices expressing pro-Russia views on the war and its prospects,\" their report said. US intelligence agencies have also warned of Russian operatives covertly using social media to sway public opinion.  Dr Arachchilage said Russian actors were more interested in influencing \"public opinion and election outcomes\".  \"[This is] by undermining the trust in democratic institutions and spreading fake content across social media.  \"They use a sort of disinformation campaign using deep fake technology ... and inflammatory social media content.  \"They often try to create capitalist and sensational narratives [to] easily break into people's mindset and change their opinion to what they want.\"  Along with Meta labelling China its third-highest source of CIB operations, Microsoft's report noted influence actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continued to engage Americans online.  \"[They are] expanding to new platforms and evolving their tactics to engage new audience spaces ahead of November,\" the report said.  Eight years after the last US election marred by foreign interference, a shadowy figure is offering media organisations access to documents allegedly obtained from former president Donald Trump's re-election campaign. \"Beginning in late April through May, the most prolific of these actors ... leveraged hundreds of accounts to stoke outrage around pro-Palestinian protests at US universities.\"  The report alleged the CCP-linked actor attempted to mimic students involved in the protests, \"reacting in real time\" and offering directions to protest locations.  \"Some of these accounts seeded left-leaning messages into right-wing groups,\" the report said. \"[This was] likely either to further agitate conflict about the protests or misunderstanding which US audiences would be most receptive to their intended message.\"  Other CCP-linked accounts have pivoted to \"short-form video content\" criticising the Biden administration, sometimes racking up \"hundreds of thousands of views\". A US intelligence report circulated in March alleged an \"ambitious but anxious\" China was demonstrating a higher level of \"sophistication\" in its influence activity. It said social media accounts \"run by a [People's Republic of China] PRC propaganda arm\" had begun to experiment with generative AI and target candidates as early as the 2022 midterm election cycle. \"The PRC may attempt to influence the US elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify US societal divisions,\" the report said. \"PRC actors have increased their capabilities to conduct covert influence operations and disseminate disinformation. \"Even if Beijing sets limits on these activities, individuals not under its direct supervision may attempt election influence activities they perceive are in line with Beijing's goals.\"  Dr Arachchilage said: \"By and large everybody is trying to use social media platforms, that could be Facebook, Twitter [X], Instagram, any media that we have, to disrupt the trust in the 2024 election. \"I think what they're trying to do is social engineering, the art of human hacking, breaking into people's mindset to change their opinion,\" he said.  \"The art of human hacking is a challenging thing, but we need to have the legislation, regulation, even technical and non-technical counter-measures developed to protect the nation.  \"Otherwise this is going to be a threat to national democracy.\"  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Crime Topic:Explainer China Cyber Crime Iran, Islamic Republic Of Media Russian Federation US Elections United States Voting World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

They include agents from the Pittsburgh field office who were responsible for security planning ahead of the rally and one agent assigned to Trump's protective detail.  The agents are on administrative leave, meaning they cannot perform investigative or protective work. At least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty after the failed attempt to assassinate US presidential candidate Donald Trump.  They include the special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, three other agents assigned to the office, and one agent who was assigned to Trump's protective detail, a law enforcement official said.  The acting director said his agency had made a mistake in assuming local police would take responsibility for securing the roof where a shooter later opened fire on Donald Trump's rally. The Pittsburgh office was responsible for the security planning ahead of the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to an official who had direct knowledge of the matter.  The agents are on administrative leave, meaning they cannot perform investigative or protective work. On July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks used an AR-15-style rifle to fire shots that hit Trump's right ear, kill one rally attendee and injure two others. The shooting was a devastating failure to carry out one of the agency's core duties and it led to the resignation of the Secret Service's then-director, Kim Cheatle. At a congressional hearing after the assassination attempt, Ms Cheatle acknowledged the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting.  Ronald Rowe, the new acting director of the Secret Service, takes questions from the Senate committee.

The US Secret Service's new acting director, Ronald Rowe Jr, said he was \"ashamed\" of the security lapse that led to the attempted assassination but blamed the shortfall on local law enforcement. In testimony before two Senate committees in July, Acting Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of the building from which Mr Crooks fired shots.  \"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Mr Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees.  \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"  AP Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Shootings US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

The Democrat turned independent has endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump, despite their past criticisms of one another. Mr Kennedy has officially filed to have himself removed from the ballot in 10 critical swing states, but Americans can still vote for him in others. Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced he will suspend his election campaign and throw his support behind Republican candidate Donald Trump. The 70-year-old reportedly filed paperwork on Thursday to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states, but said he would remain a candidate in other states that were unlikely to sway the outcome of the election. \"I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory,\" he said at an address in Phoenix on Friday, local time.  Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says he has \"so many skeletons in my closet,\" following an allegation that he sexually assaulted a former family babysitter. Mr Kennedy said he had met with Trump and his aides several times and learned they agreed on issues including border security, free speech and ending wars. \"There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences but we are aligned on other key issues,\" he said at an address in Phoenix. \"I've made the heart-wrenching decision to suspend my campaign and to support President Trump,\" he added. \"This decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends, but I have the certainty that this is what … [I'm] meant to do.\" Trump celebrated Mr Kennedy's endorsement at a campaign stop in Las Vegas.  \"I want to thank Bobby. That was very nice,\" he said.  \"He's a great guy, respected by everybody.\" His announcement came after support for him in national polls plunged to about 5 per cent and his campaign funds began to run low. An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Mr Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.

Franklin) With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Mr Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Mr Kennedy soared.  He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Mr Kennedy drawing the support of 20 per cent of Americans in a three-way race with Mr Biden and Trump. He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, former US senator Robert F Kennedy, and uncle, former US president John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family. For a time, both the Biden and Trump campaigns showed signs they were worried that Mr Kennedy could draw enough support to change the election outcome.  Mr Kennedy built an unusually strong base for a third-party bid, fuelled in part by anti-establishment voters and vaccine septics who had followed his anti-vaccine work since the COVID-19 pandemic.  But as the race changed quickly in the last two months — with Trump surviving an assassination attempt and 81-year-old Mr Biden bowing to pressure from his own party and passing the campaign torch to Harris — voter interest in Mr Kennedy waned. Democrats have shrugged off his announcement. \"Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,\" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement. Kerry Kennedy (right) and other members of the Kennedy family support Joe Biden at a Democratic campaign event in April. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) A year ago, some would have thought it inconceivable that a member of arguably the most storied family in Democratic politics would work with Trump to keep a Democrat out of the White House.  Even in recent months, Mr Kennedy has accused Trump of betraying his followers, while Trump has criticised him as \"the most radical left candidate in the race\". Five members of the Kennedy family issued a statement on Friday calling his support for Trump \"a sad ending to a sad story\". \"We want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future, a future defined by individual freedom, economic promise and national pride,\" read the statement, posted by his sister Kerry Kennedy on X.  \"We believe in Harris and Walz. Our brother Bobby's decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear.\" Trump mega-donor Timothy Mellon, an 82-year-old banking heir, has given millions of dollars this election cycle to support Mr Kennedy, and $US75 million ($110 million) to support Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings through to July 31.

(Reuters: Vincent Alban) While America's Democratic diehards enjoyed pep talks and pop music at their party-vibes convention this week, a smaller panel event on the sidelines was striking a very different tone. The first speaker, Hala Hijazi, was in tears before she'd even finished introducing herself to the room. \"I'm here because I've had over 100 of my family killed in Gaza,\" Hijazi said.  \"Just two last week.\" For years, Hijazi's served the Democratic Party and its causes in San Francisco: fundraising, doorknocking for candidates, and serving on the board of a group that trains Democratic women to run for office.  But for all her public service, she said, she felt she'd let her family in Gaza down. \"I feel guilty because for 25 years I've been living my American dream while they've been under occupation, struggling and dying,\" she said.  \"I'm a fraud for not speaking up for them for the past 25 years. But that has changed.\" As a Democratic organiser in California, Hala Hijazi has known Kamala Harris a long time. (Gabrielle Lurie/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images, file) Hijazi is part of a growing Democratic movement pressuring the party, from within, to rein in military support for Israel. But it's up against some powerful forces that want to maintain the status quo. \"Dark money\" is a big one, Jewish ex-congressman Andy Levin told the panel event. Pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC spent millions to help another Democrat unseat Levin in 2022, after he spoke out on Palestinian rights.  It recently did the same thing to two other outspoken Democrats in Congress. (AIPAC says the success of the candidates it backs shows it is \"good politics and good policy to stand with the Jewish state\".) But Levin is optimistic about the party's new presidential candidate. He points to her impassioned calls for a ceasefire back in March, and her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last month. \"She refused to go to his absurd speech to a joint session of Congress,\" Levin said. \"Then when she met with him, she did speak some truth to power to him. I don't think that's that easy.\" Hijazi has hope too. As a longtime Democratic organiser in Harris's home state of California, she's known the vice-president for more than 25 years.  \"She's trying,\" Hijazi told the panel. \"We have to hold her accountable too, but we also have to give her a chance.\" As the panel was taking place in a packed conference room, pro-Palestinian protesters were gathering in a park closer to the convention arena. \"Genocide Joe\" has long been a popular chant at these protests. This time, the catchcry was \"Killer Kamala\". The US gives Israel several billions of dollars' worth of military support each year, and President Joe Biden ticked off on a $US14.1 billion boost in April.  Protesters who spoke to the ABC had little faith in Harris adopting any different stance to Biden, if she were elected president in November. Nima Homami travelled more than six hours from Ohio to protest outside the Democratic National Convention.  (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"Her political career, if you trace it, she has received heavy backing from many of the same Zionist donors who are backing Joe Biden,\" said Nima Homami, who'd travelled from Ohio for the protest.  \"I don't know, honestly, if the Democrats will ever listen. It feels like there's just too much money involved.\" But inside the Democratic Party tent, the lobbying efforts persist. Most of the delegates attending the convention on behalf of their state parties were there to support Harris.  But about 30 were there to represent Democrats who voted \"uncommitted\" when asked to choose the party's presidential candidate in primary elections this year. \"We saw 101,000 'uncommitted' voters in Michigan,\" said Jonathan Simonds, an uncommitted delegate from Hawaii.  \"We saw almost 800,000 uncommitted voters across the country in the primary, and those are Democrats.  Jonathan Simonds was at the convention to represent \"uncommitted\" voters from Hawaii. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"I think that some of them will vote for Harris either way, and wanted to make a statement.  \"But I think that there's a certain proportion of those voters who will maybe not vote for Trump, but won't feel inspired enough to go to the polls for Harris.\" The Uncommitted National Movement's main demand is for an arms embargo, and they point to a series of polls showing declining support among Democrats for American military aid to Israel. In a YouGov/Economist poll this month, 49 per cent of likely Harris voters were in favour of America reducing military aid to Israel, compared to 29 per cent who wanted it maintained, and 8 per cent who favoured an increase.  The movement also requested a speaking spot at the convention for a Palestinian American. They provided the DNC with a shortlist of elected Democrats to choose from. Asma Mohammed and Jeremiah Ellison were part of Minnesota's uncommitted delegation. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"The DNC kept telling us that they would get back to us, and they were working on it, and to be patient,\" Asma Mohammed, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota, told the ABC. \"And finally, [Wednesday] at 8pm they told us the answer was no.\" Some uncommitted delegates responded by staging a 24-hour sit-in next to the convention arena, sleeping on the concrete outside the stadium.  One of the speakers on the shortlist was Georgia state Democrat Ruwa Romman, who prepared a speech about her family's Palestinian roots and their recent pain, but did not directly criticise the Biden administration.  \"Let's commit to each other, to electing Vice-President Harris and defeating Donald Trump, who uses my identity as a Palestinian as a slur,\" she said in the speech, which she delivered at a press conference outside the stadium instead. When Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler was asked why the movement's request for a speaker was rejected, he did not directly answer. But he said: \"We're proud and glad they're here. We've worked to engage them throughout the convention. We're proud of the fact that we held panel conversations with members.\" James Zogby, the founder of the Arab America Institute and a former member of the Democratic National Committee's executive, said the decision \"was an unforced error, it was stupid, and it will cost support\". \"The idea of not having a Palestinian speaker was the most boneheaded mistake I've seen in politics in a long time,\" said Zogby, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights. \"There are many votes that they may lose because they didn't have one.\" But Harris faces the reverse pressure from inside the party, too. Some Democrats want to see more support for Israel from the party's leadership. \"They've handled it OK – not as strong as I would like,\" said Richard Levik, a volunteer at the convention who also attended a small pro-Israel rally outside. Richard Levik, from Palm Springs, wore a Harris T-shirt and anti-Trump badge to the pro-Israel rally. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"If [the October 7 attack] happened to us, we'd be doing more than what Israel has done. And we support them in fighting a war that Hamas started.\" Last month, Netanyahu told Congress that more American weapons could help end the war. \"Give us the tools faster, and we’ll finish the job faster,\" he said. The Israel-Gaza war is not a top priority issue for most American voters, polls have consistently shown.  But experts say it could prove critical in Michigan, partly because of its large Arab American and Muslim population. And that state could in turn prove critical to the election result. \"The major element of a rapprochement between Harris-Walz and the Arab Americans in Michigan would be, at a minimum, to have a ceasefire,\" said Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \"That would probably affect two or three or four percentage points of the vote in Michigan, but that could make a difference in the actual outcome.\" Some uncommitted delegates staged a sit-in at the convention. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) On the final night of the convention, the uncommitted delegates ended their sit-in and walked into the arena, with their arms locked, in time to hear Harris's speech. They did not expect to hear support for an arms embargo. But some in the movement were hoping, as a minimum, Harris would use her convention speech to commit to following American and international law regarding weapons provisions. Her remarks fell short of what they'd hoped for. \"I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organisation called Hamas caused on October 7,\" she said. As some shouts of \"free Palestine\" were heard in the crowd, Harris went on to describe the scale of suffering in Gaza as \"devastating\" and \"heartbreaking\". \"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realise their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.\" The uncommitted movement is now demanding Harris meet with their leaders, and impacted Palestinian families, by September 15. They have not spelled out what they will do if she refuses. \"We're not going anywhere,\" said uncommitted delegate Jeremiah Ellison, who serves on the Minneapolis City Council.  \"We're not going to accept rejection. We're long-time party activists. We're long-time community organisers. We know how to mobilise.\" — with Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Jade Macmillan Topic:US Elections Topic:War Israel Occupied Palestinian Territories US Elections United States Unrest, Conflict and War World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Mr Brandis told Q+A he hoped Democrat Kamala Harris won the US presidential race because of the danger Trump posed. Polling shows a majority of Australians do not want to see Donald Trump return to power, but US pollsters predict a close race. A senior Liberal Party figure and former diplomat has warned of the \"alarming\" consequences of a \"ghastly\" Donald Trump returning to the White House, predicting the Republican candidate would \"absolutely\" start World War III. George Brandis, a former federal attorney-general and foreign ambassador, told the ABC's Q+A on Monday that Trump's foreign policy would be \"a real danger to the West\". He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should be particularly concerned as the war with Russia ground on. \"He [Trump], in my view, would on day one throw Zelenskyy under a bus,\" said Mr Brandis, who served as Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2018 to 2022. \"He would send a signal to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin that Putin can get away with what he likes. Does anybody believe that Trump would defend the Baltic states? Of course he wouldn't. \"And so what happens to NATO? What? So I'm really alarmed … in a geopolitical sense.\" While Australia's current political leadership are careful not to buy into US politics ahead of the November election, former leaders like Malcolm Turnbull have lashed Trump and warned of the consequences of his re-election. Earlier this year, Mr Turnbull told Q+A that Trump's \"creepy\" embrace of Putin was a \"terrifying\" threat to democratic order. Australians overwhelmingly reject Trump's return to power too, at least according to new polling by Talbot Mills Research released to the ABC, with Trump registering just 27 per cent support compared to 48 per cent for Democrat Kamala Harris. The race is much closer among likely voters in the US, with Harris marginally ahead in recent polls. Mr Brandis said the vice-president would have his vote. \"Even though I come from the conservative side of politics, I'm hoping that Kamala Harris wins because I think Donald Trump is so dreadful,\" he said. \"But then I would have voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because I'm an original believer that Donald Trump is dreadful. \"There are bigger issues at stake here which make him too dangerous a person in my view to be the president of the US again.\" Liberal MP Keith Wolahan said, \"we respect the decision is the American people's to make\". But he understood the excitement around Kamala Harris, who was born to an Indian mother and Jamaican-American father. \"I was born in Ireland and I remember many houses would have … a picture of the pope and John F Kennedy. For many Irish people, when they saw an Irish Catholic become the most powerful person in the world, it meant a lot. \"These things do matter.\" Americans remain deeply polarised over their choice between Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. In Australia, a new survey suggests one candidate has overwhelming support. Q+A heard from Indian-Australian Rohan Hora, who said his community had been energised by the Harris campaign. \"Seeing the energy and the hope in my parents' faces when we talk about American politics now, it's something that I've never seen before,\" he said. \"It shows it's possible for somebody like me to get into politics and that's something I haven't seen in my lifetime.\" Egyptian-born Labor frontbencher Anne Aly said it was \"touching to hear\". \"I never imagined a career in politics for myself,\" she said. \"And I have to say it's not just politics, [it's] mainstream media as well.

Weeks after the shooting that left one man dead and several others, including Trump, injured, questions remain about how the 20-year-old gunman was able to open fire The House of Representatives task force, established on July 29, has assumed control over all committee investigations. Its members were accompanied on their tour by local and state police officials, visiting first the area where Trump took the stage before proceeding to the rooftop site the shooter fired from. At least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty after the failed attempt to assassinate US presidential candidate Donald Trump.  Task force chairman Mike Kelly said the team had \"really good people looking for the truth\". He added visiting the scene in Butler, compared to looking at pictures and video, was \"the difference between day and night\". \"When you're actually here on this surface, when you're walking these grounds, when you're actually going to the building, you're actually up on the roof, looking at where we had people positioned … right away, it's like, 'Okay, I got it,'\" he said. \"So for us, the big thing was to be on the ground … be comfortable with the questions we were going to ask.\" At least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty and the organisation's then-director Kim Cheatle has resigned in the wake of the shooting. Ms Cheatle came under intense scrutiny amid questions about how shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to get on top of the building near the rally venue with a rifle. The rooftop from which Crooks fired was less than 150 metres from the podium. It had been identified as a point of vulnerability days before the rally. Crooks, who was shot and killed by Secret Service snipers moments after opening fire, appeared to have a clear view of Trump from the roof. Colorado Democrat and special forces veteran Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger also on the task force, said it was a \"fundamental\" principle in the military to \"secure the high ground\". \"Or you always have eyes on the high ground,\" he said. \"So I definitely took note today that there are a lot of lines of sight that appear to have been unsecured. \"Certainly at this point [there are] a lot more questions than answers.\" He declined to comment on who the committee was specifically planning to interview as part of their investigation. The task force, which is made up of both Republican and Democratic representatives, was approved by the House in a bipartisan vote of 416 to 0. Mr Kelly said: \"When you talk to the members of this committee who have done military service, they look at it … and they say, 'How could this not have been prevented?' \"And the burning question [for me] is always going to be, there was knowledge ahead of time that there was a person of suspicion on that roof and armed. An FBI official tells senators there was no indication gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks had any strong political views or any co-conspirators.\n\n  \"The key [thing] was, get the former president of the United States off the podium, then there's nothing that has to take place. \"[Corey] Comperatore would be alive today … not only did we lose Mr Comperatore that day, the Crooks family lost their son.\" Investigators have so far struggled to understand why Crooks, a nursing facility aide, carried out the attack. Ms Cheatle, FBI director Christopher Wray and other security officials said in a briefing call with US senators last month they had yet to find a \"political or ideological\" motive. They have also not found any indication of any co-conspirators after searching his home, his laptop and two phones.

An indictment filed in the federal court this week removed allegations that Trump sought to involve the US Justice Department in the election subversion conspiracy. The updated indictment represents the prosecution's effort to keep its case against Trump alive, in the wake of a landmark court ruling that granted him presidential immunity. Donald Trump has been hit by a new federal indictment in his bid to overturn his 2020 election defeat, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a US Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity form criminal prosecution. Donald Trump has been formally indicted for a third time, over alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that culminated in the January 6 insurrection. Here's what we know so far. The revised indictment no longer includes allegations that Trump sought to pressure the US Justice Department in the alleged election subversion, an apparent effort to keep the prosecution alive after the high court found that Trump could not be prosecuted for that conduct. Special counsel Jack Smith lodged the updated indictment in the Washington case, which keeps the same criminal charges but narrows the allegations to an area of conduct for which the Supreme Court last month said Trump was entitled to immunity given he was president at the time. Mr Smith's office said it was issued by a grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. The updated criminal case no longer lists as a co-conspirator Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department official who championed Trump's false claims of election fraud.  Trump's co-conspirators were not named in either indictment, but they have been identified through public records and other means. Special counsel Jack Smith filed the updated indictment against former president Donald Trump. (AP: Jacquelyn Martin) The indictment retained the allegations that Trump attempted to pressure then-vice-president Mike Pence to refuse to certify the electoral vote count, and accuses him of a multi-part conspiracy to block the certification of his election defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court that the interactions between Trump and Mr Pence amounted to official conduct for which \"Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution.\" The new version of the indictment hinges on key testimony and evidence from witnesses largely outside the federal government, such as former Arizona house speaker Rusty Bowers, whom the indictment says was pressured by Trump and a co-conspirator into holding a hearing based on bogus assertions of voter fraud. The two sides will be back in court for a status hearing next week, the first such appearance in months given that the case had been effectively frozen since last December as Trump's immunity appeal worked its way through the justice system. Trump faces four separate charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. All come with possible jail terms, some of up to 20 years, though it's rare for the maximum sentences to be handed out. Trump is again seeking election as the Republican candidate in this year's election, this time in a race against Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris.

Crooks researched online about both the Republicans and Democrats, including Joe Biden, in the months leading up to the July shooting in Pennsylvania. Investigations remain ongoing into the security failures that led to the shooting and the motivations of the now-deceased Crooks.  The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a \"sustained, detailed effort\" to attack a major gathering of some sort, before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally last month, according to the FBI. On Wednesday, FBI officials said 20-year-old Thomas Crooks had searched for information about Trump and his rival President Joe Biden more than 60 times ahead of registering to attend the rally in Butler on July 13. \"We saw … a sustained, detailed effort to plan an attack on some events, meaning he looked at any number of events or targets,\" Kevin Rojek, the FBI's top official in western Pennsylvania, said in a telephone briefing to reporters. Details around what motivated the shooter behind Donald Trump's attempted assassination remain elusive. (Anna Moneymaker) Mr Rojek said Crooks became \"hyper focused\" on the Trump rally when it was announced in early July \"and looked at it as a target of opportunity\". More than a month on from the attempted assassination, the FBI has still not been able to determine what motivated the attack.  Officials have not found any evidence indicating Crooks had worked with other people, or had been directed by a foreign power. Mr Rojek said his computer activity showed he had \"no definitive ideology … either left-leaning or right-leaning\". The ABC has recreated the scene of the fatal rally in Pennsylvania. The assassination attempt prompted questions about how Crooks was able to climb a nearby building and fire eight shots at the former president before being killed by a Secret Service sharpshooter. A House of Representatives task force heading the investigation into the incident visited the rally site this week probing how the shooting played out, but said it was left with \"more questions than answers\".  The FBI, meanwhile, is investigating Crooks himself. Officials said they had gained some understanding of his mindset, even if they still did not know what motivated him. It has been confirmed there were no traces of illicit drugs or alcohol in his system at the time. Thomas Matthew Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022.\n  (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) Crooks searched for Trump's campaign events as early as September 2023, FBI officials said, and began searching in April for campaign events for both candidates near where he lived in western Pennsylvania. He also searched for the dates of both the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions that took place in July and August, with turnouts of close to 20,000 people. In the days leading up to the July 13 rally, Crooks searched for information about the site, including where Trump would speak and details of the company that owned a nearby building where he would later fire the eight shots, one of which grazed Trump's ear.  Thomas Crooks's rifle broken down as was likely done for transport and the backpack recovered onsite. (Federal Bureau of Investigation) Video evidence shows Crooks was only on the building's roof for about six minutes, from where he appeared to have a clear view of the stage.  The rooftop had been identified as a point of vulnerability days before the rally and there was also prior intel pointing to an armed person on the rooftop.  The receiver for remote detonation  in Crooks's improvised explosives was in the \"off\" position (Allegheny County, PA Police Department via FBI) \"The key [thing] was, get the former president of the United States off the podium, then there's nothing that has to take place,\" chairman of the investigating task force Mike Kelly said.  Crooks, who left several explosive devices in his car, had searched for information about bomb components as early as 2019. Photos released by the FBI on Wednesday showed two improvised explosive devices, a semi-automatic rifle and a backpack belonging to Crooks that were recovered from the shooting site.  These are the first pieces of evidence released under the investigation so far.  The pictures showed the rifle intact — as it was found — as well as collapsed, which is how officials believe Crooks transported it in his bag. The explosives discovered in the 20-year-old's car trunk were said to have \"several problems in the way they were constructed\".  ABC/Reuters Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Topic:Shootings Topic:World Politics Crime US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke The stakes for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz were high as they sat down with CNN for their first interview since Joe Biden stepped aside. These were their biggest moments. By Jessica Riga Here's what's happening next in US politics in the not-too-distant future. The two presidential candidates will face off in a debate next month on September 11 at 11am AEST. The debate will be hosted by ABC News (America) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — a key battleground state in the November election. CNN's June debate between Biden and Trump had muted microphones when candidates were not speaking. Earlier this week a Trump spokesperson said the two sides had agreed to the same terms, but a Harris spokesperson said conversations were still ongoing. By Caitlin Rawling The third part of CNN's exclusive interview with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, has been uploaded to the network's YouTube channel. By Jessica Riga Jeremy Barr from the Washington Post just spoke to News Channel about how Kamala Harris and Tim Walz's interview has been received in the US. \"I think the consensus was that she didn't do incredibly well but she did well enough to not generate negative headlines about it,\" Barr says. \"The format was a little bit stilted, you had two people sitting at a table with the moderator across from them. It was a strange dynamic but she seemed to do fairly well, I think she hit most of her policy points. \"[CNN] were definitely tying to hold them accountable, push them on past inconsistencies. \"I think because this is the first interview they've done together the CNN anchor wanted to take advantage of that and push them.\" By Caitlin Rawling CNN has uploaded the second part of its exclusive interview with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to its YouTube channel. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Kamala Harris's decision to avoid interviews like this up until now meant there was plenty of anticipation - and pressure - on the vice-president in the lead up. Republicans have seized on some of the clunkier language that she has become known for, often referred to as \"word salads\". And they're keen to highlight what Donald Trump has labelled her \"flip-flops\" on policy areas like fracking and immigration. Harris was on the defensive for quite a bit of the interview, trying to argue that while her positions had shifted, her values had not. She didn't seem totally at ease with the format, and interviewer Dana Bash had to follow up on what should have been an easy question about what she'd do on her first day in the White House. But there didn't appear to be any catastrophic stumbles, and Trump responded on social media with the message: \"BORING!!!\" Harris's campaign will be hoping this hasn't done anything to halt her early momentum. But will it be enough to change the mind of anyone who's currently unsure about whether she should be elected to the top job? Either way, the pressure won't relent any time soon. The next big test could come when she faces off against Trump in their first debate next month. By Jessica Riga Since this was an exclusive interview with CNN, you could only watch the interview on the network's stations. But it has since uploaded the first part of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz's interview to its YouTube channel. By Jessica Riga CNN's interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz has wrapped up. But don't go anywhere, as we'll still have plenty of analysis from our Washington DC bureau colleagues as we recap the key moments. By Caitlin Rawling Tim Walz has been asked about the viral moment his son Gus was seen crying and shouting \"that's my dad\" at the Democratic National Convention, last week. He says it was so important that his son feels that sense of pride for his dad. \"It was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I'm grateful I got to experience it,\" Walz says. He then goes onto say how proud he is of his son, his daughter Hope, and his wife Gwen. \"I think the one thing is, talking about the era we're in is our politics can be better. It can be different,\" Walz says. He says families can be involved in politics and these are the kinds of moments, people can be shown. \"I hope that there was a hope, people felt that out there, and I hope they hug their kids a little tighter, because you just never know, and life can be kind of hard.\" By Jessica Riga CNN's Dana Bash is talking about this picture snapped by New York Times photographer Todd Heisler at the DNC last week. In the image, one of Harris's grand-nieces looks up as Harris delivers her speech. \"You didn't explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech, but it obviously means a lot to a lot of people, and that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you?\" Bash asks Harris. \"I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph, and I was deeply touched by it,\" Harris says. \"It's very humbling. It's very humbling in many ways.\" By Caitlin Rawling Tim Walz has been asked what he would say to voters, who can't take him at his word. This comes after he said he and his wife used IVF, when it turns out they used a different kind of fertility treatment. Walz says he has been very public and open about things. He says people that he has formerly served with can see it. \"They vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make them.\" By Jessica Riga Kamala Harris is detailing the moment US President Joe Biden called his VP and told her he was ending his White House bid. She says it was a Sunday and she had just sat down to do a puzzle with her family after eating pancakes when Biden called. \"I asked him, 'are you sure?' And he said yes, and that's how I learned about it. \"He was very clear that he was going to support me.\" CNN's Dana Bash asks for more details, and if Biden endorsed Harris immediately on the phone. \"My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him,\" Harris says. \"I think history is going to show a number of things about Joe Biden's presidency. I think history is going to show that in so many ways it was transformative.\" By Caitlin Rawling Kamala Harris's running mate Tim Walz has been asked if he misspoke after he said he carried weapons in war, but had never actually been deployed in a war zone. Before answering the question, he talks about being proud to wear the uniform for 24 years and how his record speaks for itself. CNN's Dana Bash, didn't back down and asked Walz again if he had misspoken. Walz admitted he misspoke about carrying weapons in war. \" Yeah, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war, and my wife, the English teacher, who says my grammar is not always correct,\" Walz says. He then went on to say, people find anything to critique him on. \"If it's not this, it's an attack on my children for showing love for me. \"And the one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's service in any way. I never have and I never will.\" By Jessica Riga We're back from another ad break. CNN's Dana Bash tells Kamala Harris she was a \"very staunch defender\" of President Biden's capacity to serve another four years, before asking Harris if she has any \"regrets about what you told the American people.\" \"No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now, and I'll tell you, it's one of the greatest honors of my career,\" Harris says. \"And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people deserve in their president. \"By contrast, the former president has none of that.\" By Jessica Riga \"I'm unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself, and that's not going to change,\" Kamala Harris says. But she turns her attention to what happened on October 7 and beyond. \"1,200 people massacred, many young people who are simply attending a music festival, women were horribly raped. \"Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, and we have got to get a deal done. \"This war must end, and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. \"I've met with the families of the American hostages. Let's get the hostages out. Let's get the ceasefire done.\" By Jessica Riga We're back from the break. CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash asks Kamala Harris about Donald Trump's racial attacks, most notably when he said his opponent \"wasn't Black enough\". Harris shakes her head, as if speechless, and seems like she doesn't want to spend too much airtime on the subject. \"Same old, tired playbook,\" she says. \"Next question, please.\" \"That's it?\" interviewer Dana Bash asks, in case Harris would like to continue. \"That's it,\" Harris replies. By Jessica Riga CNN has teased that we'll soon hear about the moment Joe Biden called Kamala Harris to tell her he was withdrawing from the election race. It also looks like we'll hear more from Harris's running mate Tim Walz. By Jessica Riga CNN released some snippets of this interview a few hours ago, which my colleague Carrington Clarke covered in the blog earlier. To reiterate, Kamala Harris said she would be open to the idea of a Republican being part of her cabinet. \"I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican,\" she says. She was also asked to explain how her views on major policies have changed. She said her values haven't changed but \"I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems\". By Jessica Riga \"Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions?\" CNN's Dana Bash asks the Democratic presidential nominee. Kamala Harris again frames her answer around Donald Trump's time in office. \"Through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted, which we supported, which I support. \"And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would have contributed to securing our border, and because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, don't put it forward. \"He killed the bill, a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more agents on the border.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, sat down with CNN's Dana Bash for 18 minutes to discuss their sudden elevation on the Democratic ticket. The interview was seen as a major test for Harris, who has stumbled in the past in similar situations. Back in 2021, for example, she was widely criticised after she got into a strange back-and-forth with NBC's Lester Holt about why she hadn't visited the US-Mexico border, despite being tasked with a leading role on immigration. \"You haven't been to the border,\" Holt said. \"And I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris replied. \"And I mean, I don't understand the point that you're making. I'm not discounting the importance of the border.\" So the stakes of the interview on CNN on Thursday, local time, were high as the Harris-Walz campaign sought to fight the narrative that they might not be ready for the highest office in the land. These were the biggest moments from the interview. Harris has had a most unusual rise to the top of the ticket. In case you've forgotten, President Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination with Harris as his running mate. Joe Biden, who walked the halls of power for half a century, built a career on relationships. But in the end, it was his decision alone to do something no president had done before.  But after a calamitous debate against Republican challenger Donald Trump in June that raised questions about his fitness for the job, he eventually bowed to party pressure and stepped aside for his vice-president. Harris has had a charmed run ever since, with national polls showing her catching up to Trump and the party faithful cheering her on at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) earlier this month. Biden has given his full-throated endorsement to Harris, describing the moment he chose her as his VP as the best decision of his presidency. Kamala Harris became the nominee after Joe Biden stepped aside.  (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) But Bash asked Harris some tough questions about whether she ever had concerns about Biden's mental acuity or age during their years together in the White House. \"He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and loyal to the American people. And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room,\" she said. \"He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgement and disposition that I think the American people deserve in their president.\" While there were no major flubs during her interview, this wasn't the energetic, commanding and yes, joyful, Harris we saw at the DNC.  Given there's been a month to prepare for this interview, Harris's team would have wanted a strong start.  The first question from Bash was fairly straight forward and obvious.  \"What would you do on day one in the White House?\" she asked.  \"First and foremost, one of my highest priorities, is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,\" Harris responded.  But before offering any real details, she then attempted to turn the attention to Trump.  Bash attempted to get her back on track.  \"So what would you do day one?\" she prompted.  Harris passed over several other much more famous Democrats to pick Walz as her running mate. The Minnesota governor has lit the internet on fire by combining folksy charm, a nice dad energy, and devastating attack lines on Trump. But the Republican Party has sought to paint him as being dishonest on multiple fronts. They accused him of embellishing his record of service in the National Guard, lying about a youthful drunk driving arrest, and misrepresenting his and his wife's infertility treatments. Tim Walz and his daughter Hope on day four of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.  (Reuters: Brendan Mcdermid) When questioned by Bash, he admitted he mixed up in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) with intra-uterine insemination — the treatment used by the Walzes to have both their children — but said it wasn't intentional. \"I certainly own my mistakes when I make them,\" he said. \"The one thing I'll tell you is I wished in this country, we wouldn't have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues because it's hell, and families know this.\" Bash also asked Walz about one of the most viral moments of the DNC earlier this month, when his son Gus was moved to tears as he watched his dad accept the nomination to be Harris's running mate. Gus Walz was moved to tears as he watched his dad accept the nomination to be the Democratic running mate in the 2024 election.  (Reuters: Brendan Mcdermid) \"As a father, I could not have ever imagined that I would be grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket,\" he said as he fought back tears. \"But it was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I'm grateful I got to experience it, and I'm so proud of him. I'm proud of him, I'm proud of [daughter] Hope. I'm proud of [wife] Gwen, a wonderful mother, and these are great kids.\" During the interview, Harris had to address two of the most difficult and divisive issues for the Democratic Party: immigration and the war in Gaza. Polls put Kamala Harris slightly ahead of Donald Trump in the US election race. But there are two potential stumbling blocks that could up-end the contest once again. One of the most pointed and repeated attacks on Harris from the Republicans has been her record as the White House's so-called \"immigration tzar\".  The moniker stems from the early days of Biden's presidency, when he announced Harris would be helping to coordinate relationships with Mexico and Central American countries to address the root causes of undocumented migration into the US.  Harris defended her record on the issue, pointing to her time as the Californian attorney-general and her prosecution of human trafficking gangs. She also wants to enact the bipartisan immigration bill that was agreed to earlier this year, before Trump effectively killed it by applying pressure to Republicans to withdraw their support.  The bill includes funding for more border agents and to build more security fencing. The war in Gaza similarly divides the party, with the rifts playing out even more publicly of late. Earlier on Thursday, Harris was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters as she spoke at a rally in Savannah, Georgia. During her CNN interview, Harris mostly kept the same policy as Biden, saying she's doing what she can to get the remaining hostages home and a ceasefire in Gaza. The Israel-Gaza war remains one of the most divisive issues in the Democratic Party.  (Reuters: Abed Sabah) In the interview Harris says she remains \"unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defence\".  She repeatedly says they must get a \"deal done\" but offered no clear road map on how that ceasefire could be agreed to, given we are now in the 10th month of the war. It seems extraordinary, but Harris has never met Trump face-to-face. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the very first time during their presidential debate on September 10.  (Reuters: Marco Bello/Jeenah Moon) That will change in less than two weeks when they debate each other in Philadelphia.  Harris was quizzed about how she felt when Trump had questioned her racial identity in recent months.  She shut down the question quickly by quipping, \"same old, tired playbook. Next question, please\".  But Harris did reference her Republican challenger multiple times in this interview, accusing him of mismanaging the economy while in power and working to kill the bipartisan immigration bill because it didn't serve him politically. Trump himself was obviously watching CNN, taking to his Truth social platform to say he was looking forward to \"debating Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is\".  For the past month, the Republicans have hammered Harris for not making herself available for an interview. The CNN sit-down wasn't the authoritative performance that her team would have wanted, but it also wasn't a train wreck. She'll have the chance to improve upon it at next month's debate.

(File). (AP: Jacquelyn Martin) Vice-President Kamala Harris has shared a statement on X, saying former president Donald Trump has \"disrespected sacred ground\" by taking photos at Arlington National Cemetery. Ms Harris cited reports that Mr Trump's campaign aides created an altercation with a cemetery staffer and then took photos of the graves of war veterans. She says Mr Trump was disrespectful \"for the sake of a political stunt\". Vice-President Kamala Harris says former president Donald Trump \"disrespected sacred ground\" in his recent appearance at Arlington National Cemetery, where the Republican nominee took and distributed images despite a federal prohibition on campaign activity on the grounds. In a statement posted Saturday on the social media platform X,  Ms Harris cited reports that Mr Trump's campaign aides created an altercation with a cemetery staffer and proceeded to take photographs and film the former president, including at the graves of Afghanistan war veterans, after being warned about rules at the site. \"Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,\"  Ms Harris said, calling Arlington a \"solemn place where we come together to honor [sic] American heroes … not a place for politics.\" The US Army confirmed a service member was \"abruptly pushed aside\" by a member of Trump's team after she tried to stop the Republican camp from filming in Section 60. The original incident stemmed from Mr Trump's and Republicans' continued criticism of  US President Joe Biden and now Ms Harris for the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan.  At the invitation of some family members of service members killed during the withdrawal, Mr Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honour of Sergeant Nicole Gee, Staff Sergeant Darin Hoover and Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss.  They were among 13 US service members and more than 100 Afghans who died in a bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, on August 26, 2021. Mr Trump's campaign was warned about not taking photographs before an altercation at the cemetery, according to defence officials.  Officials have said since that an Arlington employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly \"verbally abused and pushed\" aside has declined to press charges.  Bill Barnett and Donald Trump place their hands over their heart after placing a wreath. (AP: Alex Brandon) The Trump campaign has since lashed out at Pentagon officials, with a top campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, referring to military spokespersons as \"hacks.\"  Trump campaign officials said it had permission to bring someone to take video. Since Mr Biden ended his re-election bid, Mr Trump has been zeroing in on Ms Harris and her roles in foreign policy decisions.  He has specifically highlighted the vice president's statements that she was the last person in the room before Mr Biden made the decision on Afghanistan. As Kamala Harris emerges from her first real test as the Democratic nominee for president, she was forced to defend changing her mind, writes Jade Macmillan.   Mr Biden's administration was following a withdrawal commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020.  A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Mr Trump and Mr Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan's military and the Taliban takeover. Ms Harris on Saturday alluded to Mr Trump's history of picking fights with veterans and repeated allegations that he has \"called our fallen service members 'suckers' and 'losers' and disparaged Medal of Honour recipients.\" \"This is a man who is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself,\" Ms Harris said.  \"I will always honour the service and sacrifice of all of America's fallen heroes. … And I will never politicise them.\" AP Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Crime Topic:Explainer US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(ABC News: Jerry Rickard) With Donald Trump looking to return to the White House, his one-time director of communications Anthony Scaramucci has warned that the former president's \"malevolence\" and \"cruelty\" could be costly to the United States and the world. In a wide-ranging interview with 7.30, Mr Scaramucci, who was sacked by the previous Trump administration after just 11 days in his role, spoke on Kamala Harris, the upcoming US election and what he sees as the dangers of a second Trump White House. Mr Scaramucci believes that what Trump stands for and represents is dangerous. \"It's the malevolence, it's the cruelty,\" Mr Scaramucci told 7.30. \"You can't have the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour, and you can't have Lincoln talking at the Lincoln Douglas debates about it being the last best place for all mankind and the need for all of us to suppress our tribal instincts and unify, and then have Trump. \"He's an anti-American presidential candidate.\" Donald Trump is looking for a second term as US president. (Reuters: Reba Saldanha) A major fear for Mr Scaramucci is that Trump will run an isolationist United States that will repeal trade agreements and pull out of NATO, potentially leaving Russian President Vladimir Putin unchecked. Trump has already said he would cut US funding to Ukraine as it continues to fight a war, after Russia invaded in 2022. But Mr Scaramucci warns that Trump would do much more to enable Putin, who he courted a political relationship with during his presidency. \"There are three big dangers,\" Mr Scaramucci told 7.30. \"The first danger is that he wants to destabilise the current world order, so he'll roll back the WWII rules-based society, which, at least in North America and in Europe, is NATO. \"He'll roll back NATO [and] he'll give space for Vladimir Putin to project his power back into Eastern Europe, which will keep Vladimir Putin in power and be absolutely devastating for Eastern Europe. \" Vladimir Putin recently visited Mongolia but was in no danger there despite an ICC warrant for war crimes against him. (Sputnik via Reuters: Natalia Gubernatorova) Mr Putin's war in Ukraine has already caused the estimated loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. There have been other ructions too, especially in northern Europe. There were flashpoints at the Finland border in late 2023 as an influx of asylum seekers tried to cross into the Nordic nation, which resulted in Finland closing the border with Russia. Finland also began construction on a 200-kilometre fence on its Russian border, while they and Sweden, longstanding non-NATO nations, moved to join and were successful. Mr Scaramucci said that was a sign of Mr Putin's ambition and that Trump rolling back NATO would only enable the Russian leader. \"They're smart people in those two countries [and] they're telling you that they feel a danger from Vladimir Putin,\" he said. \"The rollback of NATO, that's a very big danger. It will diminish the rules-based society and it will also weaken our position with our allies.\" At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO countries that did not spend enough. The BBC reported that in 2020, Trump told President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen that \"NATO is dead\". Mr Scaramucci believes a second Trump White House would not only abandon NATO but become more isolationist. Could the White House once again see Donald J Trump in the Oval Office? (Reuters: John Pryke) \"He literally wants to wall off America … from the rest of the world,\" Mr Scaramucci told 7.30. \"He wants to put on exorbitant tariffs, he wants to reject immigrants. \"He's calling for a deportation of 15 million people. \"That's in Project 2025 and it comes out of his mouth almost every night at these rallies.\" Trump's march to re-take the White House defiantly continues. If he wins he'll have an \"army\" of 10,000 recruits at his disposal to help implement his controversial agenda. Project 2025 is what the director of a network of conservative groups, Paul Dans, described to Four Corners as a detailed \"battle plan\" that has the people trained and ready to execute it. The plan would see the power of the US president expanded and the civil service stacked in his favour. Opponents of the plan warn that it would see Trump empowered, enabled and emboldened and push the USA towards an authoritarian state. Trump has said he has \"nothing to do\" with Project 2025 but Mr Scaramucci says the former president's goals are not that different. Anthony Scaramucci has gone from Trump supporter to ardent Trump critic. (AP: Pablo Martinez Monsivais) \"There are 14 million people that work for the government, 12 million that are employed, 2 million contractors,\" Mr Scaramucci said. \"He wants the top 50,000 people to be fired.\" \"He put 85 loyalists into the project. \"What's embedded in the project is exactly what he wants to do.\" Trump's own campaign page says he wants to stop migrants and seal the US border as well as \"carry out the largest deportation in American history\" as its top two objectives. However, it does not state any changes to the US civil service or the way government operates. The upcoming US election has been turned on its head since US President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic candidate and Vice-President Kamala Harris took his place. Mr Scaramucci, like many analysts, believes it was a move that changed the election, with Ms Harris a genuine chance of defeating a Republican party that has been lurching farther to the right. Donald Trump has been campaigning in the \"rust belt\" states already. (AP: Alex Brandon) A self-described lifelong Republican, Mr Scaramucci has described it as being a party of hoopla about one man: Donald J Trump. \"This is a Trumpist party,\" Mr Scaramucci said. \"This has elements of fascism in it. This has elements of liquidating the other two branches of the government. \"He has a group of acolytes now with him that are hard right. \"He had more mid Republicans, middle-ground Republicans and careerist Republicans with him in 2016 but he doesn't have that now, those people have left him. \"He's got 40 people that served him in various capacities, in the cabinet, including his vice-president [Mike Pence] that are denouncing him and explaining the danger of him. \"He's got this new group of people that are to the hard right, and they're very well-organised, which makes him more dangerous. \"He's not an ideological person himself, but he's now adhered to ideological people.\" Standing in Trump's way is Ms Harris and Mr Scaramucci says the exit of Mr Biden has meant Trump has had to pivot his attack plan but has yet to master it when it comes to the Democratic nominee. Vice-President Kamala Harris will soon debate Donald Trump in a major moment for US voters. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) \"I think he's been shaken by her but I think he's a very adaptive guy,\" Mr Scaramucci told 7.30. \"He's a human Swiss Army knife and in terms of his political instincts, he'll find the right tool to strike at her rhetorically. \"He hasn't been able to find that yet because he was fixated on Joe Biden. He was fixated at being the younger of the two candidates in the race, and he's also been imperilled by the demography. \"You've had this great demographic recirculation, so when he calls her stupid and he says she turned black and all this sort of nonsense, baby boomers were conditioned to deal with that, but the generation Zs, they don't like it at all.\" While Mr Scaramucci praised Ms Harris as being intelligent and having a good policy record, he believes she has to be more aggressive in combating Trump on the election trail. He says their upcoming debate will be a key moment for Ms Harris but she needs to explain her position and how she will help Americans. \"If you look at the predicted markets and so forth, he [Trump is] in the pole position. \"He is favoured on two issues that really matter to America, the economy and the issues at the border as it relates to immigration, and she can take them on, but she's got to get way more aggressive. \"Her economic agenda is actually working, and Americans may not feel it today, but she can go into the heartland and she could explain to them what Joe Biden and her did, that are actually creating a good set-up for the next four years … but she's got to get out there and articulate that.\" When it comes to November, the \"rust belt\" is predicted to be key. That area includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wisconsin and parts of New York State. Mr Scaramucci told 7.30 people there were desperate and could be attracted by Trump's messaging. And to win the presidency, Ms Harris will need to appeal to them. \"[These] people have become economically desperational and Trump's message resonates with them,\" Mr Scaramucci said. \"The victim message, 'let's stick it to Washington'. It works with them, but if she comes at it from a different perspective, which is more unifying and more healing, she could [get] them, but it's going to be tough.\" Watch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays at 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV Do you know more about this story?

The charges relate to $US10 million paid to a US company that was commissioned to produce online videos aimed at influencing the 2024 presidential election.  Both RT employees are in Russia and remain at large. The United States has charged two employees of a Russian state media company for working to influence the 2024 presidential election.  Money laundering charges against two employees of Russian state media network RT were filed by the US Department of Justice on Wednesday, local time. The intelligence community is warning of an increase in US election interference as voting day approaches. But each set of hackers have their own methods and motives. Department officials said the two employees used shell companies and fake personas to pay $US10 million ($14.88 million) to an unnamed Tennessee company to produce online videos aimed at amplifying political divisions in the US. The US Treasury and State departments also announced actions targeting RT, including the network's top editor, Margarita Simonovna Simonyan. US officials said Russia's goal is to exacerbate internal political divisions in the US and weaken public support for American aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin was aware of actions by news outlet RT to influence the 2024 US presidential election, the White House said on Wednesday. \"We believe Mr Putin was witting of these actions,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. Merrick Garland says his department \"will be relentlessly aggressive in countering attempts\" to interfere in the 2024 election. (Reuters: Anna Rose Layden) US Attorney-General Merrick Garland said the US would be \"relentlessly aggressive\" in countering attempts from foreign actors to interfere in the 2024 election. The FBI separately sought court permission to seize 32 internet domains it said were part of Russia's foreign influence effort. RT responded with ridicule. \"Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections,\" the media outlet told Reuters. The media outlet ceased operating in the US after Russia invaded Ukraine. A network of 5,000 accounts apparently being operated using AI has been exposed on X, formerly Twitter, with concerns the Beijing-based operation could be designed to disrupt the coming US election. A Russian politician called the reported accusations \"pure rubbish\" and said Moscow does not think it matters whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the November 5 election. \"The only winner of the US election is the US private military industrial complex,\" State Duma Deputy Maria Butina told Reuters. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Moscow has repeatedly said it has not meddled in the US election. The criminal indictment charged the two RT employees, Konstantin Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, with conspiracy to violate US money laundering and foreign agent laws. Both are based in Russia and remain at large. The Tennessee company produced nearly 2,000 videos on topics like immigration and inflation that have been viewed 16 million times on YouTube since last November, according to the Justice Department. The White House says Vladimir Putin is aware of RT's actions. (Kremlin Pool Photo via AP: Sofya Sandurskaya) In one instance, Ms Afanasyeva told the company to provide a video that blamed Ukraine and the US for a terrorist attack on a Moscow music venue, the Justice Department said. The indictment does not name the Tennessee company or charge any of its executives with wrongdoing.  However, it alleges that the company failed to disclose that it was funded by RT and its executives never registered with the Justice Department that they were acting as agents of a foreign government. Justice Department officials say Russian President Vladimir Putin and his proxies have adopted increasingly sophisticated techniques, targeting specific groups of voters and those in battleground states, and are now using bot farms and artificial intelligence.

(Reuters: David Dee Delgado) Donald Trump was due to be sentenced for falsifying business records later this month, but the hearing has been postponed. It means Trump will not be sentenced before the November 5 election. Trump's sentencing is now set for November 26. A New York judge has postponed Donald Trump's sentencing for his \"hush money\" crimes until after the upcoming US election.  Judge Juan Merchan agreed to a request from Trump's lawyers to delay the sentencing hearing, which had been set for September 18. He rescheduled it for November 26, three weeks after the election. In May, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign.  Judge Merchan wrote he was postponing the sentencing \"to avoid any appearance — however unwarranted — that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate\". \"The Court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution,\" he wrote. He added that adjournments for sentencing \"are routinely granted, often several times\" and there was \"no reason why this Defendant should be treated any differently to any other\". The decision is another legal win for the Republican presidential nominee, whose lawyers have successfully delayed two other criminal trials, which both relate to Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the election result.  A fourth criminal case, in which Trump was accused of mishandling classified documents, was thrown out of court by Trump-appointed judge Aileen Cannon in July.  Forced to endure five weeks of painstaking testimony inside a drab Manhattan courthouse, a dozen New Yorkers were drawn into a House-of-Cards world of scandal, skulduggery and sex. Trump is also appealing against his conviction in the hush money case, after the US Supreme Court ruled in July that ex-presidents had some immunity from criminal prosecution in some circumstances. Judge Merchan said he would rule on that appeal on November 12. Trump is the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. He has maintained his innocence, denied ever having a sexual encounter with Daniels, and criticised his prosecution as a politically motivated witch-hunt. The Manhattan district attorney who brought the case, Alvin Bragg, is an elected Democrat. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years' prison, but legal experts have said the maximum sentence is highly unlikely in Trump's case. Other potential penalties include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge, which would require Trump to stay out of legal trouble to avoid additional punishment. The sentencing delay means Trump could be the American president-elect on sentencing day. However, the winner of the November 5 election will not become president until they are sworn in at the inauguration in January.

(Reuters) If there was ever any doubt about whether a debate could change the course of a presidential campaign, it's recently been put to rest. So both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are awake to the high stakes as they prepare to face off. The debate is being hosted by America's ABC network in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – one of the crucial battleground states that both candidates have been targeting during the campaign.  Given how close the polls are, including in those swing states, this debate has the potential to have a big impact on the race for the White House, again. Trump-Harris debate: Look back at our blog to see how the candidates performed in their first encounter It's today at 11am AEST in Australia. The debate is happening in Philadelphia and is scheduled for 9pm on Tuesday, September 10, local time.  In Australia, you can watch on the (Australian) ABC News Channel, including on YouTube and iview. We'll also be live blogging the debate here on the ABC News website with our experts in the US and Australia. America's ABC will stream the debate on its website and YouTube channel. They're very similar to last time: The debate will go for 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks. Candidates will have two minutes to answer each question, with a two-minute rebuttal, and an extra minute for a follow-up, clarification or response. There will be no audience. (But, unlike the CNN debate, some reporters will be allowed in the room.) No props are allowed. No pre-written notes are allowed, but candidates will be given a pen and paper. Microphones will be muted except for when candidates are asked to speak. There will be no opening statements. The candidates will be asked to give two-minute closing statements. ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir will ask the questions. David Muir (left) and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate. (AP: Elise Amendola) Trump last week won a coin toss and opted to give his closing statement last. Harris chose to stand at the podium on the right of screen. No. In fact, Harris and Trump have not met in person. According to CNN, the only time they've been in the same room was during Trump's State of the Union addresses to Congress.  This is the second, and possibly final, presidential debate of the 2024 election campaign.  The first was hosted by CNN on June 27, local time. Of course, that debate was between Trump and President Joe Biden, whose poor performance triggered a crisis of confidence among Democrats that ultimately led to Biden's withdrawal from the election. Here are the key takeaways from that event. Harris's last election campaign debate was against Trump's then-vice-president, Mike Pence, during the 2020 race.  Their only debate was a less fiery affair than those involving the presidential contenders, Trump and Biden. But Harris – who was separated from her opponent by a plexiglass screen because of the pandemic – inspired some viral content by twice shutting Pence's interruptions down with the line, \"I'm speaking.\"  There were few standout moments, though, as both vice-presidential candidates aimed to do what vice-presidents are supposed to do – avoid stealing the limelight. It's telling that the big meme-generating moment came thanks to a housefly that perched itself on Pence's head and stayed there for a good couple of minutes. Last week, Trump said Harris was a \"nasty person\" and \"the way she treated Mike Pence was horrible\". (Pence has refused to endorsed Trump, whose supporters brought a noose to the Capitol and chanted \"hang Mike Pence\" during the January 6 insurrection.)  True to form, Trump has been trashing the host network and attempting to set early expectations that the debate is stacked against him. \"ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness,\" he told Fox News last week.  \"They are the most dishonest network, the meanest, the nastiest, but that was what I was presented with.\" Kamala Harris went head to head with Mike Pence in a vice-presidential debate in the last election campaign. Trump has also complained that Harris's \"best friend is the head of the network\", an apparent reference to Dana Walden, the co-chair of Disney Entertainment, which owns America's ABC.  Walden and her husband are long-time friends of Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. The couple has donated to Harris's past political campaigns, and they held a fundraiser for her at their LA home in 2022. But Disney says Walden is only involved in corporate matters, like budgets and staff size. The company recently told the New York Times that \"all editorial decisions are in the hands of ABC News management and the seasoned journalists and producers of ABC, who hold themselves to the highest journalistic standards\". The Harris campaign is also complaining of being disadvantaged, after it failed to persuade ABC to keep both candidates' microphones on throughout the debate. \"Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President,\" the Harris campaign wrote in a letter to ABC. Harris's debate preparation appears to have been more intense than Trump's. She's been staying at a hotel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, doing some practice sessions with trusted staff.  One of them is Philippe Reines, who has been playing the part of Trump in mock debates. He did the same thing for Hillary Clinton back in 2016. Trump told a New Hampshire radio station that there was \"not a lot you can do\" to prepare, but that he had \"been prepared for this debate my whole life\". \"You can't sit in a log cabin like [2012 Republican presidential candidate] Mitt Romney,\" Trump said. \"Do you remember? He sat there for four weeks at a log cabin, didn't talk to anybody, and then he came out, he couldn't speak. You can't do that.\" However, the New York Times reported at the weekend that Trump was having multiple debate preparation sessions, and had put in more work to prepare for the 2024 debates than he did in 2016 or 2020. Tim Walz (left) and JD Vance have agreed to debate too. (Reuters) Harris's running mate Tim Walz and Trump's running mate JD Vance have agreed to debate on October 1. That debate is set to be hosted by TV network CBS in New York City. It will take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Polls will open as early as 5am local time in some jurisdictions and close as late as 8pm.

At a Rotary Club meeting in a church south of Atlanta, the Georgia Secretary of State wants to assure any \"hardcore Republicans\" that he hasn't \"gone to the dark side\". What he means by that is the Democratic side of politics. Raffensperger is the Republican who pushed back when Donald Trump famously called him in January 2021 and said he wanted to \"find \"11,780 votes\" in Georgia. That would have given Trump one more vote than Joe Biden, who flipped the state in the 2020 presidential election from Republican to Democrat.  Raffensperger's stance alienated the MAGA wing of his own party and led to threats against him and his family.  But he stood firm and got re-elected as secretary of state. He has since overseen a series of voting reforms that he argues should strengthen trust in the electoral system and leave less room for conspiracy theories to flourish.  Brad Raffensperger was removed from Georgia's election board after it was overhauled by the state legislature. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) The changes include more restrictions on the locations and opening hours of absentee ballot boxes. Photo identification is now required for all forms of voting, and it's illegal to give food or water to anyone waiting in line to vote. Democrats decried the changes as an assault on democracy.  Raffensperger argues they benefit all Georgians. \"I want to really give you great confidence in Georgia, because we have a great story to tell,\" he tells the assembled Rotarians. But the actions of the Republican-dominated state election board are threatening to undermine those assurances.  The board, which oversees and regulates elections in Georgia, has been making some other changes. The five-member board has been overhauled by Republicans in Georgia's state legislature. Raffensperger, its previous chairman, was removed from it. Three other Republicans have effectively been put in control. Donald Trump described the Republicans on the election board as \"pitbulls\" for victory. (Reuters: Megan Varner) They have set about pushing through a series of new rules empowering local officials to investigate ballot counts at their own discretion.  Raffensperger describes those new rules as \"a mess\". \"They're talking about opening up those ballot boxes at the local precincts, instead of bringing back to the headquarters in a secured box,\" the secretary of state told the ABC on the sidelines of the Rotary event.  Marc Elias, a top election lawyer for the Democrats, told a podcast that the rules were akin \"to saying at a football game that we're going to give the scoreboard operator the opportunity to investigate for themselves whether a touchdown was scored\". The national and state Democratic parties have launched legal action demanding the rules be overturned. Raffensperger appears to agree with them, even if he won't say so outright. \"I do not support the rules as they are,\" he says. At a recent rally in Georgia, Trump called out the board's Republican members by name and called them \"pitbulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory\". One of the so-called pitbulls is Janelle King, a former deputy director of the state Republican Party who was appointed to the board earlier this year. Janelle King is one of three Republicans on the five-person state election board. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) \"President Trump gets excited, he says a lot of things,\" she told the ABC. \"We get attacked 24/7, all day long, so I welcome positive comments.\" King insists she is not a MAGA extremist and says she's had no conversations with Trump or his team about the rule changes. She dismisses concerns they will lead to delays in certifying the vote. \"Why do we have to overturn a rule that gives election officials more confidence in their decisions?\" she says. \"These are the things that strengthen our elections.\" But Raffensperger fears they are \"really going to jam up the works\". \"When you have too much time, it's a great friend to conspiracy theories,\" he says. Democratic state senator Nabilah Islam Parkes describes the board's new rules as \"unethical\" and \"illegal\". She's written to Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp asking him to remove the board members.  \"I'm worried that the state election board is going out of its way to basically rig the election for this November 5,\" Senator Islam Parkes said. \"Last time around ... Donald Trump tried to overthrow our votes, and now him and his MAGA allies are doing similar things at the state election board.\" Democratic state senator Nabilah Islam Parkes fears the board is trying to rig the election. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Kemp asked his attorney-general, Chris Carr, to determine whether he was obliged to open an investigation into the board's activities. Carr found he wasn't, leading Senator Islam Parkes to accuse him of \"providing cover for the MAGA election board members\". Critics of the state election board are urging voters to keep pressuring Kemp to take action. Any doubts about whether a debate could change the course of a presidential campaign have been put to rest. So both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are awake to the high stakes of their face-off. Back in 2020, Kemp also pushed back on Trump's attempts to challenge the outcome of the election, leading to a public falling out. Recently there seems to have been a thaw in relations and, so far at least, Kemp has given no signal he's prepared to intervene in the dispute about the board's actions. The latest polls indicate another very close race in Georgia, with Trump neck and neck with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.  The Republicans think they have a good chance of taking back the traditionally conservative state and Trump is making overtures to African Americans who make up one third of Georgia's population. It's here in Georgia that the former president was booked last year on criminal charges related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results in the state of the 2020 election. The case is currently on hold pending appeals, but Trump is making hay with the mugshot he got at the local jail. \"The mugshot, we've all seen the mugshot, but you know who's embraced it more than anyone else? The Black population,\" the former president said earlier this year. \"It's incredible.\" Azad Ahmadi, an Atlanta businessman and committee chair on Georgia's Black Republican Council, describes that comment as \"awkward\". \"But I get it,\" he says. \"It's not a matter of Black men identifying with being criminals.  \"This is about Black men feeling like they've been marginalised, and he's one of the few white men in America that can relate to that.\" For a while, Azad Ahmadi didn't talk openly about his support for Donald Trump. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) African Americans have traditionally been part of the Democrats' core constituency. In 2020 Joe Biden secured 92 per cent of the Black vote nationwide. Even a small shift in voting patterns could have seismic consequences. Azad, a 41-year-old army veteran, said he realised before the 2016 election that the Republican Party was more aligned with his \"core values\" than the Democratic Party.  He was also drawn to Trump's background as a property tycoon. \"I decided that one of the things that this country needed was a businessman, and so that was very appealing to me at the time.\" For a while Azad says he kept his thoughts to himself. He jokes that, even in 2020, when he mentioned his support for Trump at his barber shop, he thought he was going to have to shoot his way out of there. Now, he says, the conversation is more open. Maurice Combs doesn't buy that.  Maurice Combs (left) doesn't believe Donald Trump's claims he is winning over Black voters. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) The Atlanta master barber says Trump's claims that Black men relate to his mugshot are \"like a slap to the face\". \"Because he's privileged,\" says Maurice. \"I got friends that can't vote because they're convicted of a felony and he can run for president.\" Maurice began sweeping floors in a barber shop as a teenager, and he's been working in the profession for three decades. The 51-year-old is not convinced more Black men will vote for Trump this time around. \"I don't know what Black men he talking about. Might be the guys around him that say yes to everything he say.\" Maurice doesn't think too highly of politicians in general, but says he will be voting for Kamala Harris. \"In America, we always have to go for the lesser of two evils, and I have to do what I think is going to be better for my people in the long run.\" But Harris can't rely on the support of Black voters, even here in the Deep South. Kamala Harris has also been campaigning in Georgia. (Reuters: Megan Varner) Azad Ahmadi's fiancée, 34-year-old Alexandra Knoten, thinks that for the first time in her life she'll back a Republican presidential candidate. \"Your initial thought is, wow there's an African-American woman in the position to be president. \"And then that facade kind of went out the window. It's like, where has she been the whole presidency when Biden was here? I mean, it's like she was a ghost.\" When she was growing up in Louisiana, Alexandra said she just accepted that everybody around her voted Democratic. That's just the way it was.  \"It's kind of like, your grandmother is a Democrat, your mother's a Democrat, so you're automatically a Democrat.\" Azad Ahmadi's fiancée, Alexandra Knoten, is considering voting Republican for the first time. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Some of her relatives still can't believe she's \"really gonna vote for Trump\". But the sales and events manager says she also felt better off under Trump than Biden. \"I think my monthly cost in gas is about almost $1,000 or more a month, and I didn't have that issue when Trump was in office.\" Georgia's secretary of state is having people from his office drop in on voting offices across Georgia to test their electronic election systems, sometimes with the media in tow. \"We want everyone to understand that we have fair, secure, accurate elections here in Georgia,\" Raffensperger tells a group which includes the ABC and crews from the US, UK and Germany.  The company whose voting machines Georgia uses, Dominion, settled a defamation case against cable news giant Fox last year for $US787.5 million ($1.17 billion).  Dominion sued Fox News and Fox Corporation over the airing of conspiracy theories involving the machines. Raffensperger assures the assembled media that the test at the Spalding County offices has confirmed everything is working perfectly.  He wants to prevent a repeat of the chaos that followed the last vote. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (right) has been overseeing checks of Georgia's electronic voting systems to try to prevent conspiracy theories. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) After he resisted Trump's attempts to find him more votes in 2020, Raffensperger says he was doxed. In 2022, he told a congressional committee that threatening messages his wife received were often sexualised and were \"disgusting\". Raffensperger also testified that someone broke into the home of his widowed daughter-in-law and her two children. (Raffensperger's son died in 2018 of a fentanyl overdose.) \"We were very concerned about her safety also.\" Asked at the time why he didn't just quit and walk away, he said he \"had to be faithful to the constitution\". \"I think sometimes moments require you to stand up and just take the shots.\" If one of those moments arises again, Raffensperger says he won't hesitate to do what he thinks is right. \"I'm always prepared to follow the law and follow the constitution,\" he told the ABC.  \"I'll do my job.\" — with Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime US Elections United States Voting Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

But his catastrophic performance saw him drop out of the 2024 race 28 days later in favour of his deputy. Harris and Trump have never met before, and while presidential candidates haven't shaken hands during a debate since 2016, the Democratic nominee strode across the stage and introduced herself. \"Kamala Harris,\" she said while extending her hand. Trump shook it. Kamala Harris walked across the stage and offered her hand to Donald Trump as they met for the first time.  (AP: Alex Brandon) While the candidates appeared sombre for the first few moments, the mood in the debate hall seemed to shift when Harris implied that people leave Trump's election rallies early. From that moment, the debate took a fierce and fiery turn. These were the big moments from the clash between Harris and Trump — most of which were gazumped by Taylor Swift's decision to immediately endorse the Democrat after the debate was over.  Debates are as much about style as they are about substance, so all eyes were on how Harris and Trump appeared side by side. Her microphone might have been off while Trump was speaking, but the split screen was not, so Harris's disapproval of his comments on immigration and the economy was written all over her face and very visible to the audience. Kamala Harris looked on and occasionally laughed while listening to Donald Trump. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) At times, Harris brought her hand to her chin, stared at former president Trump and pondered his responses with an expression of bewilderment on her face. In particular, as Trump explained his belief that in Ohio, people were eating cats and dogs — more on that later. As Harris spoke however, Trump stared straight ahead barely moving and never looking across to his opponent. The former president did, however, jump on an opportunity to use one of Harris's most famous debate lines against her. As Harris spoke over Trump he stopped mid-sentence and said: \"I'm talking please. If you don't mind, please. Does that sound familiar?\" His jab was an obvious nod to Harris's rebuke of former vice-president Mike Pence as he spoke over her in a 2020 debate when she said: \" Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking.\" The line was immortalised in a skit by Saturday Night Live.  Harris cracked through Trump's staunch veneer a little when she called him \"so rich\" for making broad statements about crime rates among immigrants when he was \"someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes\". She also hit a nerve when she brought up the crowd at Trump rallies. \"I'm going to actually do something really unusual, and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies, because it's a really interesting thing to watch,\" she said. \"People start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.\" Overall, this debate was a robust back and forth that interrogated some of the key election issues we know are likely to sway America's undecided voters. Trump's performance was arguably quite similar to the last time he was on the debate stage. Trump-Harris debate: Look back at our blog to see how the candidates performed in their first encounter The difference though was that instead of being up against an 81-year-old man who was being scrutinised for his every stumble and lost the debate for himself, Trump got to know Harris the prosecutor as she brought the fight directly to him. And after a stiff start for both of them, Harris eventually got under Trump's skin. While most national polls show Trump and Harris in a dead heat, the Republican nominee remains slightly ahead when voters are asked about which candidate they trust more when it comes to handling the economy. So Harris knew she had to demonstrate to American voters that she would be able to help them with the spiralling cost of living in the US. \"I was raised as a middle class kid, and I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,\" she said in her opening remarks. There's an eerie quiet about what potentially is looming as a future crisis point for the US economy. \"I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.\" She also sought to blame America's current economic struggles on the Trump administration's decisions while in office until 2020. Trump said, if returned to the White House, he would make the economy his top priority. \"Everybody knows what I'm going to do: cut taxes very substantially and create a great economy like I did,\" he said. \"Before, we had the greatest economy, we got hit with a pandemic, and the pandemic was, not since 1917 where 100 million people died, has there been anything like it.\" Both candidates are keenly aware that Harris is more popular with female voters, so the issue of abortion access and pregnancy care was bound to be a key point of discussion on the debate stage. Kamala Harris said a Republican White House would institute a nationwide ban on abortion access.  (Reuters: Brian Snyder) In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion — known as Roe vs Wade — saying individual states should decide if, when and how Americans can terminate a pregnancy.  In a somewhat emotional moment, Harris looked down the barrel of the camera and spoke directly to the women of America in one of her responses when she said: \"Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected he will sign a national abortion ban. \"I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one's own body should not be made by the government.\" In the first electoral test of Americans' mood since the US Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade, a traditionally conservative state votes to protect abortion rights. It could be a sign of what's to come.  Trump responded: \"No, I'm not in favour of [an] abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states.\" Asked if he would veto a national abortion ban, Trump said \"well, I won't have to\". Trump's position on abortion is confusing, but his latest strategy is to push questions about bans back towards the states. In the debate, moderators asked both nominees for their personal positions on both exceptions to abortion bans and at what point in a pregnancy abortion should not be permitted. \"I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v Wade,\" Harris said. \"Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening.\" Trump said: \"I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, I believe strongly in it.\" Recently Trump faced backlash after an apparent backflip on abortion policy in his home state of Florida. Trump initially suggested he would vote in favour of a measure aimed at undoing a six-week abortion ban in Florida, saying he believed \"we need more than six weeks\". But anti-abortion campaigners reacted strongly to the comment and the former president's position then changed. The debate took an unexpected turn when Trump was talking about immigration issues, but brought up an online conspiracy theory involving Haitian immigrants stealing pets to eat them. \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats … they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame,\" the former president said. On the southern border of the US, the Texas governor has taken drastic steps to keep migrants out of the country, and to reshape the political debate inside it. Harris's microphone was off, but she laughed audibly and shook her head and appeared to mouth, \"What?\" Local officials in the Ohio city of Springfield say there is no evidence that household dogs and cats are being turned into food. Moderator David Muir challenged Trump with a live fact-check during the debate. \"ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,\" he said. When the moderators asked if Harris would like to respond to Trump's unverified claims, she laughed and said, \"Talk about extreme!\" Immigration is another policy area where voters trust Trump more than Harris, according to some polls, as he has vowed to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants across the country's southern border. By the time moderators brought up thorny questions about foreign policy — including wars in Gaza and Ukraine — Trump was visibly angry and frustrated. In response to Harris's claim that world leaders laugh at Trump and have called him \"a disgrace\" for refusing to concede the 2020 election, the Republican insisted he has the respect of heads of state. Donald Trump was angered by a few of the questions. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) \"Let me say about world leaders, Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men — they call him a strong man, he's a tough person, smart, prime minister of Hungary — they said why is the whole world blowing up? He said because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him,\" he said. Orban has turned Hungary into what the European Parliament has denounced as a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\". \"You adore strong men instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here,\" Harris said to Trump. In response to a direct question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia, Trump was animated and agitated when he said it wouldn't have ever happened if he was president. \"I will get it settled before I even become president,\" he said.  \"If I win, when I'm president-elect, what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other. I'll get them together.\" The war in Gaza remains a divisive issue within the Democratic Party, with left-leaning supporters urging the White House to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. \"Israel has a right to defend itself … and how it does so matters. Because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, children, mothers,\" Harris said. \"What we know is that this war must end … And the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that.\" At the end of the debate, the candidates made their final pitch to the nation — and did not shake hands. It's unclear if they'll meet for further debates before they go head to head on election day on November 5. But just moments after the debate wrapped, one of America's most powerful and influential women endorsed Harris. Taylor Swift posted she would endorse Kamala Harris following the presidential debate.  \"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight,\" Taylor Swift wrote on Instagram. \"If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.\" Last time Swift, who rarely speaks publicly on politics, endorsed Democratic candidates in a Senate race in 2018, and denounced their opponent, Republican Marsha Blackburn went on and won the seat anyway. But, it's worth noting that nearly 65,000 Americans aged 18 to 29 registered to vote in the roughly 24 hours after Swift urged her millions of followers to get involved in the election. So, does a pop star's endorsement matter? We'll see on November 5.

Posting to Instagram shortly after the presidential debate, Swift called vice-president and democratic nominee Harris a \"steady-handed gifted leader\". \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" she said.  Trump-Harris debate: Look back at our blog to see how the candidates performed in their first encounter \"I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\" Swift said she was compelled to share who she was voting for after AI material of her and her fans endorsing Donald Trump circulated online. Trump himself shared the deepfakes with the caption \"I accept!\" on his social platform Truth Social. \"It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\" Swift said in her post. \"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. \"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\" Swift is widely seen as the biggest and most influential pop star in the world right now and her support this campaign has been the subject of intense speculation, with Trump himself bringing it up on social media. In February, Trump wrote that he was \"responsible for the Music Modernisation Act for Taylor Swift\" and that President Joe Biden \"didn't do anything for Taylor\". \"There's no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money,\" he wrote. \"Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis [Kelce], even though he may be a liberal, and probably can't stand me!\" At the time, a conspiracy theory accusing Swift and Kelce of faking their relationship as part of a plot to bring Trump down was swirling online. Taylor Swift is at the centre of a far-right conspiracy theory that claims the singer is part of an elaborate plot to rig football games and deliver Joe Biden the presidency. Here's how it unfolded. The singer has already proved she can have a major impact on politics. In March 2023, she posted a short message on Instagram encouraging her then 272 million followers to register to vote. Following the post, the website she directed her fans to — the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org — recorded more than 35,000 registrations, according to the organisation. The singer said she was heartened and impressed by Harris's selection of running mate Tim Walz who she said \"has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades\". Tim Walz was on live TV as Swift posted her endorsement on Instagram, and MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow read it out to him.  \"I'm incredibly grateful first of all to Taylor Swift as a fellow cat owner,\" he said.  \"That was eloquent, and it was clear, and that is the type of courage we need in America to stand up.  \"This would be the opportunity Swifties, Kamala Harris.com. \"Get on over there, give us a hand, get things going.\" Taylor Swift, whose Eras Tour has sold out in cities across the world, is widely seen as the biggest and most influential pop star in the world right now. (AP: File) Swift urged voters to do their research in the lead up to the election. \"I've done my research, and I've made my choice. \"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\" She signed off as \"Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady\" which was a reference to comments made by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats \"a bunch of childless cat ladies\".  Today is not the first time Swift has endorsed a presidential candidate. In the last debate of this election, Joe Biden saw his 2024 ambitions evaporate. This time, his deputy Kamala Harris went in determined to ruffle Donald Trump's feathers. These were the big moments. She threw her support behind Joe Biden in 2020, directly addressing Trump in a social media post saying: \"We will vote you out in November.\" Swift's started her career in country music when she was just a teenager, and in her early years of fame she was decidedly apolitical. The turning point is chronicled in her 2020 documentary, Miss Americana. The documentary shows Swift and her team debating her decision to endorse two Democrats who were running for office from Tennessee in the 2018 midterm elections, with Swift's father worrying that a political position could ruin her career. \"I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country,\" Swift wrote in a post on Instagram at the time. Then-president Trump reacted by telling reporters: \"Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 per cent less now, OK?\" Lauren Rosewarne from the University of Melbourne said while Swift has encouraged voter enrolment in the past, she may not sway the demographic Harris needs to attract. \"Whether Swift's endorsement changes voter intentions is difficult to determine,\" Dr Rosewarne said.  \"We do however, need to keep in mind that Kamala Harris's supporter base already skews young and female — which is a similar fan base to Swift's. \"Whether therefore, her endorsement has the capacity to shift the views of people who weren't already in the Harris camp is yet to be determined.   \"Harris's main problem lies with male voters: I'm not sure Swift moves them.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Elections Government and Politics Music (Arts and Entertainment) US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Take a look back through our live blog to see how it all unfolded. By Brianna Morris-Grant We're going to leave our coverage here for today. Thank you all for joining us, for weighing in with your questions and thoughts — what a wild ride! And less than 60 days until voting day, oh my! You can scroll back through the blog or sort from oldest to newest to relive all the action. Here are some big moments: You can also jump straight to closing statements from Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. And if you're short on time or chasing a recap, you can check out the key moments from the debate as pulled together by the ABC's Rebecca Armitage and Emily Clark: By Andrew Thorpe Thank you for this live blog!\nFrom an Australian insomniac in Spain  - Staeven  You're most welcome Staeven (from an Australian insomniac in Australia, on behalf of several Australian insomniacs in America). By Andrew Thorpe While Donald Trump hit the spin room after the debate, Kamala Harris has headed to a Democratic watch party at Philadelphia's Cherry Street Pier, where the atmosphere is nothing short of celebratory. Fresh off an endorsement from Taylor Swift (and with her campaign already tapping into that resource, playing Swift's The Man as Harris takes the stage), the vice-president tells the crowd she will win Pennsylvania if Democrats keep up this energy. \"Hard work is good work, and we will win,\" she says. It's a vastly different sight to Joe Biden's post-debate trip to an Atlanta Waffle House, where he received a friendly welcome but most patrons stayed in their seats. By Brianna Morris-Grant Some listeners might have been caught off-guard by Kamala Harris noting both she and her running mate are gun owners. Coming from Midwesterner Tim Walz, it might not be a surprise. But Harris has previously said she owns a gun \"for personal safety\". \"I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do – for personal safety,\" she told media in 2019. \"I was a career prosecutor.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania CNN has conducted an SMS poll of 605 debate watchers. Before the debate, the respondents were split 50-50 on which candidate they thought would perform more strongly. Afterwards, 63 per cent said Harris performed better, compared to 37 per cent who thought Trump did. The respondents were 6 points more likely to be Republican-aligned than Democratic-aligned, CNN reported. Interestingly, Harris won some viewers over. Before the debate, 39 per cent of respondents said they viewed her favourably. Afterwards, that went up to 45 per cent. But their views of Trump didn't change. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Supporters of both candidates are now arguing there should be a second debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \"Any opportunity the Trump campaign gets to put President Trump in front of the public, to talk about his plan on the economy, his plan on the border, we're going to take those opportunities,\" Republican congressman Matt Gaetz told us in the spin room. \"We hope the vice-president will debate again. President Trump will be ready any time, any place, anywhere.\" The Democratic governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, was similarly upbeat. \"I think there should be another debate, and I think the vice-president will ask for another one,\" he said. Trump has previously called for another debate on September 25, but there's no official word yet on if or when another showdown could take place. By Andrew Thorpe Other than Donald Trump himself, it's hard to find too many Republicans out there willing to talk up that performance from the former president — but one of Trump's Pennsylvania RNC delegates is doing his best. \"Donald Trump was very decisive, directive, he spoke about his vision for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but also as a nation,\"  Mike McMullen tells the ABC's Jeremy Fernandez. But even McMullen has trouble defending some of the tangents Trump went off on during this debate. \"You know, Trump is Trump,\" he says. \"All the little sidebar comments, I mean, you know, we need to focus on the issues. Jobs, taxes, the economy … all these little sidebars about people eating dogs, I mean … quite frankly it pisses me the heck off, excuse the French theology. We need to focus on the issues.\" He follows this up by insisting Trump was \"clear, on message, poignant, and focused on the issues\", so it's not entirely clear who he's blaming for the topic of pet-eating being raised during the debate. There's less hesitancy on the other side, with Clinton campaign veteran Antjuan Seawright saying Harris \"introduced herself to the American people in such a way that I think it even blew the socks off of Donald Trump\". \"[Trump] is not message-disciplined, he cannot hold a policy conversation, and he showed up very unserious and very unprepared,\" Seawright says. \"The prosecutor versus the prosecuted came through in such a very real way tonight. And I think reasonable Americans, particularly undecided Americans, have a real clear choice.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania President Joe Biden might have had some complicated feelings watching tonight's debate. He's posted his (unsurprising) verdict on social media. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Kamala Harris's vice-presidential running mate, Tim Walz, was on live TV as Taylor Swift posted her endorsement on Instagram. MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow read it to him live on air. After being kept in torturous suspense initially, he clearly loved hearing it. \"I am incredibly grateful, first of all, to Taylor Swift. I say that as a fellow cat owner,\" Walz said. (He was referring to Swift signing off the post as 'Childless Cat Lady' and posting a picture with a cat — a dig at Walz's vice-presidential rival, JD Vance). \"That was eloquent, and it was clear, and that's the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.\" By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Here in Washington DC, pubs and bars were packed with Americans from all over, straining their heads with drinks in hand to watch the high-stakes debate.   At one LGBT venue in DC's inner city, love for Kamala Harris felt palpable from the get-go. (DC is a heavily Democratic voting city, and Biden won 92 per cent of the vote here. And this particular pub has had Harris signs out the front since Biden stepped aside.) Chants of \"lies, lies, lies\" rippled through the room as Donald Trump derided Harris for being, in his view, \"the worst vice-president in the history of our country\".   When the debate drew to a close, patrons gave a slow clap and gulped back their beers. Standing near me were a group of friends eager to share their reflections on the past 90 minutes.  \"I mean who was Trump trying to appeal to?\" Noah Leonard from rural Ohio asked his friends. \"Kamala exceeded expectation. She knocked it out of the park and really put Trump on the fence.\"  “Yeah, I love how she drove Donald Trump in a corner,\" Dawn Roy chimed in. \"She was really on her points.\" Their friend Morgan said: \"I don't know, I definitely don't agree with everything she said.\" They added: \"But listening to her speak, I felt like Kamala actually cares about America and is at least trying to better the American public. Whereas I feel like Trump is not all there… he terrifies me.\" \"Yeah, Trump just went from the same playbook he always does,\" David Michael said.  “He’s banking on racial tension and conflict and we — all Americans are tired of that.”  Asked about his hope for America’s future, Josh Williams shrugged.  \"I really don’t feel great about any election we've had in a while. But with Kamala we've got the best candidate we've had since… maybe 2012,\" they said. By Brianna Morris-Grant While the speed of the debate makes it difficult to fact check in real time (despite ABC America's moderators stepping in repeatedly), moderators from several outlets are already on the case. Fact-checking organisation Politifact was verifying/debunking candidate claims as the debate unfolded. Among Donald Trump's false claims, they included: Kamala Harris also made several statements that were exaggerated or needed further context, according to fact-checkers, including: By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan The news about Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris hit the spin room as supporters of both candidates were speaking to journalists gathered here. I asked former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy whether it could hurt Donald Trump's chances at the election. \"I don’t think it’s that relevant,\" he replied. \"I do think that it is another example of kind of a Hollywood entertainment elite class closing ranks, obviously. \"But I don’t think it’s going to have a major impact on the election.\" By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke About an hour after the debate wrapped, the national and international journalists in the \"Spin Room\" moved in unison as an excited mass to the entrance as word rippled through of the former president's arrival. Encircled by the scrum of cameras and microphones, Donald Trump claimed it was his best-ever debate and the reason Kamala Harris wants a second debate is because \"she lost very badly\". When asked why he'd bothered to come to the spin room if he'd won, Trump smiled and left the building as fast as he'd arrived. No sign the vice-president will also be making the trip over. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Today is not the first time Taylor Swift has endorsed a presidential candidate. She threw her support behind Joe Biden in 2020 as well. But her fan base has swollen since then. She's just done a world tour that immediately sold out every stadium she performed in, and packed out the surrounding streets, parks and parking lots as well. She's widely seen as the biggest and most influential pop star in the world right now. So her support in this campaign has been the subject of intense speculation. It's as big as celebrity endorsements get. And Donald Trump won't be happy. In February, he wrote on social media that he was \"responsible for the Music Modernisation Act for Taylor Swift\" and that President Joe Biden \"didn’t do anything for Taylor\": \"There's no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money. “Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis [Kelce], even though he may be a liberal, and probably can’t stand me!\" At the time, there were a bunch of conspiracy theories swirling. Swift and Kelce were accused of faking their relationship as part of a plot to bring Trump down. ABC North America correspondent Carrington Clarke and reporter Lucia Stein unpacked it all in this story: By Andrew Thorpe Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie — once a fervent Trump backer, now a quotable critic for hire — lays the blame for Donald Trump's performance at the feet of his debate prep team. \"She [Kamala Harris] was exquisitely well prepared, she laid traps, and he chased every rabbit down every hole instead of talking about the things that he should have been talking about,\" he told ABC News America. \"This is the difference between someone who's well prepared and someone who's unprepared. \"Whoever did debate prep for Donald Trump should be fired.\" In case you're wondering, Trump's team reportedly included former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard, who once scored points against Harris during a Democratic primary debate, and US Representative Matt Gaetz, who was tasked with peppering Trump with questions on uncomfortable subjects. Rather than formal run-throughs with a mock opponent and debate stage, like those run by the Harris camp, Trump's sessions were informal and were labelled \"policy sessions\" on his official agenda, to comport with his claim that he didn't need to prepare for a debate with Harris. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania This is a huge post-debate boost for the vice-president. Taylor Swift is often talked about as the celebrity with the most power to influence the presidential race. Here's her post on Instagram. By Michael Rowland   Kamala Harris had one job going into the presidential debate: prove she was capable of thinking on her feet in a high-stakes environment, while at the same time showing she has what it takes to take the fight to Donald Trump. It's fair to say she got the job done. Some Democrats were concerned about the vice-president's ability to operate away from the teleprompters at carefully choreographed rallies. Harris helped contribute to these jitters by only giving the one TV interview since landing the Democratic Party's nomination. These fears would have quickly melted away within the first few minutes of the debate. In a power move, the vice-president went out of her way to introduce herself to the former president and shake his hand (they, of course, had never met). Trump appeared to have been caught off guard by this. Harris did appear nervous in her first answer on the economy, but she quickly settled. She was eloquent, passionate, and successfully baited her opponent numerous times. A line about crowd sizes at Trump rallies and people leaving early out of boredom appeared to be particularly triggering. What we saw on stage was former prosecutor Kamala Harris. It was the senator who excoriated witnesses at committee hearings. She coherently answered questions, laid out her plan for America and parried the many interjections from her right. Trump was, well, Trump. He ranted about America being overrun by immigrants, about crime being out of control and how he never lost the 2020 election. His comments were laced with grievance, anger, and falsehoods. The moderators, to their credit, called out the former president on some of his wildest claims, including his assertion that migrants were eating Americans' pets in Springfield, Ohio. Debates are important for what people say, but also how they look and sound. Look no further than the Trump/Biden showdown in June. Kamala Harris was clearly alive to the TV split screen. Where Joe Biden stared vacantly with mouth agape while Trump was talking, Harris variously laughed, shook her head and put a quizzical finger to her mouth. It is already the stuff of memes. Trump, on the other hand, looked and sounded angry. It's an approach that may appeal to the base, and particularly some male voters, but it could have put off those Americans who are yet to make up their minds. Also, it may be small thing, but Trump barely looked at Harris and referred to her only as \"she\". At one stage he told her to be quiet. It will be interesting to see how all of this sits with female voters. Kamala Harris had much more to lose from the debate. A poor performance would have been diabolical to a campaign that was already showing signs of losing some momentum. Not only did Harris live to fight another day, but she would have demonstrated to more than a few Americans she was capable of serving as commander-in-chief. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania We've barely processed what just went down in the first ever Harris-Trump debate. The Harris campaign is already calling for another one. The Reuters news agency is reporting that a spokesperson for her campaign said they should do a second debate in October. And the Washington Post says Team Harris will push, again, to have both candidates' microphones kept on during the debate, rather than muted to avoid interruptions and cross-talk. The Harris campaign's decision to request another debate was reportedly made before today's debate. By Brianna Morris-Grant \"She started by saying she is going to do this and that, do it all these wonderful things. \"Why hasn't she done it? \"She's been there for three and a half years, they had three and a half years to fix the border, they've had three and a half years to create jobs and all the things we talked about, why hasn't she done it? \"She should leave right now, go down to the beautiful White House, go to the Capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do but you haven't done it and you won't. \"Because you believe in things American people don't believe in. You believe in things like, 'we're not gonna frack, we're not gonna take fossil fuel, we're not gonna do things that will make this country strong whether you like it or not'. \"Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We are not ready for it. We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision. \"But I just ask one simple question, why didn't she do it? We're a  failing nation. We're a nation that is in serious decline. \"We're being laughed at all over the world, all over the world. I know the leaders very well, they're coming to see me, they call me, we are laughed at all over the world, they don't understand what happened to us as a nation. \"We are not a leader. We don't have any idea what's going on, we have wars going on in the Middle East, we have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine, we are going to end up in a Third World War and it will be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. \"I rebuilt our entire military, she gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan. \"What these people have done to our country and maybe toughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country, many of them are criminals and they are destroying our country. The worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania \"I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the future, and the other that has focused on the past, in an attempt to take us backward. \"But we're not going back. \"I do believe the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us and we can chart a new way forward.

What we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break and bringing down the cost of living. \"I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve, including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world. \"I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. \"I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor, I was a DA, an attorney-general, a United States senator and now a vice-president.

(Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein) Donald Trump says Taylor Swift will \"probably pay a price\" for backing Kamala Harris in the race for the US presidency. The megastar dropped a social media post backing the Democratic candidate shortly after a televised debate against Trump, her Republican rival. \"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader,\" Swift wrote on Instagram. \"I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\" Trump told Fox News he was \"not a Taylor Swift fan\", and it was \"just a question of time\" before she endorsed Harris. Swift endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Trump said she \"couldn't possibly endorse Biden\" this time around, \"but she's a very liberal person\". \"She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.\" Swift's large and loyal fan base makes her one of the most influential celebrities in the US. Trump has previously argued she should support him. In February, he wrote on social media that he had signed a 2018 law that helped musicians including Swift, and there was \"no way\" Swift could be \"disloyal to the man who made her so much money\". Around the same time, some Trump supporters spread conspiracy theories suggesting Swift and her partner, NFL star Travis Kelce, were part of a Pentagon-led plot to boost Mr Biden's election prospects. Donald Trump couldn't seem to help himself in the debate. Almost every red rag that Kamala Harris flashed in front of him, he ran straight for.  The Harris campaign is now working to capitalise on Swift's endorsement. Its online fundraising store was selling \"Harris-Walz friendship bracelets\" the morning after the debate, but they were quickly listed as sold out. By 2pm on Wednesday, local time, more than 330,000 people had visited a voter registration website using a link shared in Swift's social media post, according to the US General Service Administration. Swift signed off her social media post as \"Childless Cat Lady\", in reference to Trump's running mate, JD Vance, who used the term to insult senior Democrats in 2021. Vance said he didn't expect many Americans to be influenced by a \"billionaire celebrity\" who is \"fundamentally disconnected\" from their interests and problems. \"When grocery prices go up by 20 per cent, it hurts most Americans. It doesn't hurt Taylor Swift,\" Vance told Fox News.

Polls largely showed viewers thought Trump lost the debate, with Ms Harris performing strongly.  The US presidential election will happen on November 5. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he will not debate Democratic nominee Kamala Harris again.  \"THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social after debating the vice-president on American ABC News on Tuesday.  Donald Trump couldn't seem to help himself. Almost every red rag that Kamala Harris flashed in front of him, he ran straight for.  Several polls showed a majority of viewers believed Ms Harris outperformed Trump during the televised debate. Six Republican donors and three Trump advisers who spoke to Reuters this week said they thought the Democrat had won the debate largely because Trump was unable to stay on message. Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the Philadelphia debate, watched by 67.1 million people, according to Nielsen data. Ms Harris, speaking at a rally shortly after Trump's post went live, said: \"I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate.\" The former president took several unexpected turns during the debate, speaking at one point about an online conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets in Ohio. \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats … they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame,\" Trump said.  Local officials in the Ohio city of Springfield say there is no evidence that household dogs and cats are being turned into food. Trump had debated President Joe Biden in June before the incumbent chose to retire from the 2024 presidential race, in a debate that largely drew attention for Mr Biden's stumbling performance.  Singer Taylor Swift endorsed Ms Harris shortly after the debate ended, writing in a post on Instagram that the Democratic candidate was a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\" to her 284 million followers. Trump responded by saying Swift would \"probably pay a price\" for the endorsement. A Georgia judge on Thursday dismissed two criminal counts in the US state's 2020 election interference case against Trump and one other count against allies of the former president. A local judge found state prosecutors did not have the authority to bring charges related to the alleged filing of false documents in federal court.  Eight other charges against Trump will go ahead, with 14 co-defendants and the former president pleading not guilty to offences related to what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in 2020. The next court dates are listed for December, meaning the case will not proceed before the November 5 election. Elsewhere in New York, a court upheld a gag order imposed on Trump after his criminal conviction on charges related to hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels.  The New York state Court of Appeals said on Thursday it was dismissing Trump's appeal of the gag order because \"no substantial constitutional question is directly involved\". Trump had argued the restrictions on his ability to speak publicly about court staff and individual prosecutors violated his right to free speech as guaranteed by the US constitution's first amendment.

(ABC News: Emma Machan) Two different versions of the US are on the table, but both of them are captive to the past. Of all the schisms which cleave contemporary America, few are more stark than the divide between those who consider themselves to be victims of US history and those who fear they will be casualties of its future. Many people of colour, the large majority of whom vote Democrat, believe that the historical wrongs of enslavement and segregation have never been adequately righted. Many white American voters, the majority of whom voted Republican four years ago, fear the onset of a more \"woke\" and secular country in which whites find themselves in the minority by mid-century. A prime reason why the 2024 presidential election feels so epochal is because it has become a fight between avatars of these contrasting and conflicting Americas. Kamala Harris is a black woman, whose earliest political memories come from attending civil rights rallies in the late-1960s. \"Fweedom\" she shouted from her pushchair, she tells us in her memoir. Donald Trump is a white nationalist who made his political name as the untitled leader of the so-called birther movement, which denied the very legitimacy of the country's first black president, Barack Obama. Make America Great Again, his catchphrase, is a slogan saturated in nostalgic nationalism. Part of its appeal always lay in Trump's lack of historical specificity. So for some it conjured the America of the 1950s, before the civil rights movement hammered at the walls of prejudice and the feminist revolution shattered glass ceilings. For others, it brought to mind halcyon days when America's manufacturing heartland was known as a workshop rather than a post-industrial wasteland. Now the former president wants voters to look back wistfully on his four years in office, when mortgages were cheaper and gas prices lower. Kamala Harris, by contrast, is promising to look beyond the horizon. In her first campaign speech as the Democrat's de facto presidential nominee, she framed the election as \"a battle for the future\". Yet modern-day US politics has often become a battle over the past, revisiting histories that have never been properly resolved. The legendary Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill once famously said that \"all politics is local\", a dictum that came to enjoy a long afterlife. Increasingly, however, all politics is history. \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow\" were the lyrics from the Fleetwood Mac anthem that provided the soundtrack for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992: \"Yesterday's gone. Yesterday's gone.\" Politics back then was more future focused. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Cold War was in the past. The political theorist Francis Fukuyama proclaimed the end of history and the triumph of liberal democracy. As the new millennium approached, and the world hurtled down the information super-highway, Clinton later pledged to build a bridge to the 21st century. Victory for this son of Hope, Arkansas, marked a generational shift. George Herbert Walker Bush, his opponent in the 1992 presidential election, hailed from the Greatest Generation, the Americans who fought so valiantly in World War II. Clinton was a Baby Boomer whose formative years had been spent in the culture wars of the 1960s. That tumultuous decade loomed large during the 1992 campaign. Indeed, there were times when the vote felt like a referendum on unfinished business from the '60s. Would Americans vote for an alleged draft-dodger, who had not served in Vietnam? Would they countenance a forceful first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a high-flying lawyer who was a standard-bearer of the feminist revolution? Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone? Not a bit of it. The 1992 campaign underscored how neither the Clintons, or America, could truly break free from its history. Fast forward to the present day and US politics has become even more captive to the past. Now that Kamala Harris is heading the Democratic ticket, racism has again come to the fore — what Bill Clinton had called in his second inaugural address America's \"constant curse\". Trump's race-baiting, when he questioned whether she was truly black, did not only have echoes of his birtherism. It is a more extreme version of the \"southern strategy\" pioneered by Richard Nixon during the 1968 presidential election, in which he sought to exploit white fears about Black advance following the civil rights reforms of the mid-1960s. Harris has described the racial attacks against her as \"the same old show\". But the same old show of exploiting race for political advantage partly explains why the Republicans had a virtual lock on the White House from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. Only once during that period, in the 1976, up against Jimmy Carter, did the party lose a presidential election. Successfully playing the race card — whether through Ronald Reagan's demonisation of black \"welfare queens\" or surrogates of George H W Bush running the notorious Willie Horton ad during the 1988 election — contributed to that success. Nor is it just race. In the abortion debate, yesteryear has become the present day. Overturning Roe v Wade turned back the clock on female reproductive rights to the early 1970s. Small wonder that women in their 60s and 70s attending pro-choice rallies hold aloft banners reading: \"I can't believe I'm still protesting this shit.\" The gun debate is a clash over the meaning of the 27 words of tortured syntax and questionable grammar that make up the Second Amendment. Whereas the founding fathers intended it to be a collective right applicable to state militias, the National Rifle Association has succeeded in up-ending this interpretation and making the Second Amendment the basis for individual gun rights. Through much of US history, the Supreme Court repeatedly rejected this specious interpretation. After state militias diminished in importance, the Second Amendment even became known as the lost amendment because of its obsolescence. Not until 2008, in its landmark Heller ruling, did the conservative-dominated court finally grant victory to gun rights activists by altering its meaning. Contemporary political ideology has become more historical. On the conservative side of politics, originalism is one of the few core ideas to have survived the Trump years intact. This legal credo posits that the Constitution should be interpreted to reflect the original thinking and intentions of the founding fathers. Thus, in the majority ruling overturning Roe v Wade, Justice Samuel Alito argued that the right to abortion was not \"deeply rooted in the nation's history\". To justify his reasoning, he used the word \"history\" no less than 67 times. Presentism has become a driving idea on the left, the notion that historical figures can legitimately be judged by modern-day mores and values. This thinking led a San Francisco education board in 2021 to vote in favour of renaming 44 schools, including those honouring George Washington and Abraham Lincoln — a decision it later reversed — and New York councillors to vote unanimously to banish a statue of Thomas Jefferson from City Hall, because he enslaved more than 600 African-Americans. In recent years, the history wars have become ever more angry. On becoming president in 2021, one of Joe Biden's first acts was to banish from the White House website the 1776 Report. That was Donald Trump's pet presidential project to push back against what he called a \"radicalised view of American history\" and to produce a \"pro-American\" history curriculum. Following that edict to the letter, the panel he appointed gave America a clean bill of historical health, especially on the question of race. America, the 1776 Report concluded, was \"the most just and glorious country in all of human history\". It was a complete whitewashing of the past using heavy duty bleach. The 1776 Report became a rebuttal to the 1619 Project at the New York Times, which was first published in 2019 on the 400th anniversary of the first ship carrying enslaved Africans reaching shore in what was then the British colony of Virginia. Its aim was \"to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very centre of our national narrative\". Do Americans align with the 1776 Report or the 1619 Project? Increasingly, the debate over the meaning of America's complicated and contradictory history is conducted in a crassly binary form. Every Sunday, we’ll bring you a thought-provoking piece from some of Australia’s best writers. The battle over how history should be taught in schools has been fought with almost the same angry vituperativeness as battles over abortion and guns. Critical race theory, the inarguable nostrum that America's institutions were riddled from the start with systematic racism, has become the focus of fierce, sometimes even violent, contestation. How to make sense of the past is where white identity politics and minority identity politics often now face off. Statues and monuments have become lightning rods, especially those honouring Confederate figures such as General Robert E Lee and Jefferson Davies, the first and only president of the Confederate states. In the George Floyd summer of 2020, demonstrators seemed more determined to tear down symbols of white supremacy than to press for substantive police-reform legislation. History has not only become a driver of popular protest but of populist politics. The Tea Party movement, which first emerged during the Great Recession in 2008, was inspired by the protesters who poured chests of tea into Boston harbour in anger at their British colonial overlords. Some Tea Partiers turned up at protests wearing 18th century costumes, including tricolour hats, as if they were staging some historical re-enactment. During the January 6 insurrection, many of the rioters chanted \"1776\" as they stormed the US Capitol. Rather than seditionists, they cast themselves as patriots acting in the spirit of the revolution. For them, the violence was historically legitimate. Some carried the Betsy Ross flag, with its 13 stars and stripes signifying the original colonies, a popular banner amongst militia groups because it celebrates the era when blacks and women were barred from voting. The VDARE flag was also brandished, an homage to Virginia Dare, who is thought to be the first white child born on \"New World\" soil. In a similarly racist vein, other seditionists carried the Confederate colours. Given all the ensigns and flags, the storming of the Capitol felt like a historical passion play. In the stage management of politics, historical settings now frequently form the backdrop. During the 2020 election, Biden travelled to Gettysburg to issue a plea for national unity. Ahead of the 2022 congressional midterms, he delivered a speech defending democracy in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the framers drafted the constitution. For his first campaign speech of 2024, Biden travelled to Valley Forge, where George Washington's army had regrouped during the Revolutionary War. There, he accused Trump of \"trying to rewrite the facts\" of January 6, and of \"trying to steal history the same way he tried to steal the election\". For commentators attempting to contextualise this election, history has become a touchstone. Understandably, parallels are being drawn with 1968. That was the year President Lyndon Baines Johnson announced he would not seek re-election, his place taken at the head of the Democratic ticket by vice-president Hubert Humphrey, who did not have to contest a single primary. The year was also marred by political violence, with the assassinations both of the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, who was then running for president. The convention was even held in Chicago, the venue for this year's Democratic conclave — a far more joyous affair. Often, then, it feels as if America is facing a problem of historical overload. It is being overwhelmed, and paralysed to an extent, by a welter of unresolved history. It is tempting to bastardise that famous sign posted on the war room of Bill Clinton's Little Rock campaign headquarters in 1992. It's not the economy, stupid, but rather the history. When Joe Biden explained in a speech, delivered from the Oval Office, why he was standing aside as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, he used the superlative line from the inaugural address of John F Kennedy, the fellow Irish-American who had inspired him to enter politics. It was time, said Biden, \"to pass the torch to a new generation\". Aged 81, with a political career in Washington that stretched back to the early 1970s, Biden had witnessed, and participated in, an epic tranche of history. He was old enough to have been a member of a Democratic Party that still included racist southern segregationists, some of whom would later defect to the Republicans, the party of Abraham Lincoln. Like his friend and Catholic co-religionist, Ted Kennedy, he had switched sides on Roe v Wade, from opposing the 1973 Supreme Court ruling to fighting for its survival. He had first sought the presidency as far back as 1988, when Ronald Reagan resided in the White House. In his televised address to the nation, he invoked George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose portraits hang in the Oval Office. He spoke of \"the sacred task of perfecting our union\", echoing the preamble to the US constitution. Also he reminded his compatriots of words from the Declaration of Independence: \"We are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.\" And he ended by evoking the spirit of the American revolution, and the creation of the American republic: \"The great thing about America is, here kings and dictators do not rule — the people do. History is in your hands.\" Kamala Harris has grabbed that torch and run with it like a baton. In her first speech as the Democrat's de facto presidential nominee, she immediately sought to reframe the contest: \"This campaign is also about two different visions for our nation,\" she said, \"one where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\" Rather than embroidering her speech with historical references, she spoke of \"the beauty of this moment\". Tellingly, the only two presidents she name-checked were Joe Biden and Donald Trump. She did not even mention the January 6 insurrection, the leitmotif of Joe Biden's stump speeches. The road to the White House, she sought to affirm, would not involve glancing in the rear-view mirror. It was full speed ahead. \"We're not going back,\" she told the crowd in Milwaukee, which immediately took up that chant. \"And I'll tell you why we're not going back: because ours is a fight for the future.\" In her keynote speech at the Democratic convention last month, the phrase \"we're not going back\" became a mantra intoned over and over by her mosh pit of supporters. \"Let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told,\" she concluded by saying. But at no stage did she refer to the possibility of achieving a historic first by becoming the first woman to take the presidential oath of office. Just as Obama de-emphasised his race ahead of his victory in 2008, she is downplaying both her skin colour and her gender. That, in itself, reminds us of how in modern-day America it has become harder to turn the page. History is not so easy to escape. And nor is the Harris campaign completely ahistorical, despite all the efforts to focus on the path ahead. Consider her emphasis on \"freedoms\" — \"the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence\", as she put it in Milwaukee, \"reproductive freedom\" and \"the sacred freedom to vote.\" It is a modern-day reworking of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famous four freedoms, outlined during his 1941 State of the Union address, which included the freedom from fear and the freedom from want. Much of the appeal of her running mate, Tim Walz, comes from his traditionalism: the fact that he seems to have stepped into the present from a folksy, romanticised past. The son of rural Nebraska. The veteran who served in the National Guard. The high school teacher. The gun-owner. The coach. The soothing ambience of Friday Night Lights. \"Tim Walz is a Norman Rockwell painting sprung to life,\" reckons the Democratic strategist, David Axelrod, who served in the Obama White House. In a campaign that has tapped into the \"Brat summer\" online zeitgeist, inspired by the release of Charli XCX's album Brat, Walz seems more like a character from the hit sitcom Happy Days, the personification of a set of reassuring stereotypes. Indeed, a strength of the Democratic ticket is that it combines the old with the promise of the new. But if Kamala Harris were to win in November, would it truly mark a break from the past? That was how Obama's historic victory in 2008 was often portrayed: almost as an \"end of American history\" moment. A black man occupied a White House built by the enslaved. Finally and belatedly, the original sin of slavery had been absolved. Grace had finally led America home. Amazing grace. Yet the Obama years showed that hope and history rarely rhyme. Perhaps the central lesson we learnt from his eight years in office was that there cannot be a post-racial America partly because there cannot be a post-historical America while so much racial discrimination still persists. During the Obama years, US politics became even more racialised. Equality gaps somewhat narrowed but did not close. Rather than being unifying, a transcendent figure who could draw the red and blue states together, a black president became polarising largely because of his pigmentation. He was followed into office by a man routinely considered to be a racist, a refutation of the Obama years in human form. President Kamala Harris would surely face the same white backlash, with misogyny thrown into the mix as well. Misogynoir is the phrase that combines these two prejudices. If she is sworn in next January as the country's first female president, she would not end history. Rather, her inauguration would likely see history pressing repeat. During Barack Obama's speech to the Democratic convention, he noted of a second Trump presidency: \"We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.\" But he could also have been describing the reaction among many Trump supporters to a Harris presidency. A problem for contemporary America is that news cycles have become the historical cycle in microcosm. On guns, abortion, race, the division of power between the states and the federal government, the apportionment of power between the presidency, Congress and the judiciary, we keep on revisiting the same arguments. We keep on going over the same ground. We keep on confronting the same unresolved problems. \"We cannot escape our history.\" The words of Abraham Lincoln, contained in his message to Congress in December 1862, are just as resonant now as they were at the time of the Civil War. History, then, is not an anchor, but rather stormy seas that never calm. They could get even rougher as the country nears its 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. The United States is buckling under the weight and contradictions of its past for the simple reason that so much of that history is still being contested. All politics is history. All history is politics.

You can take a look back at all the developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest updates. By Tessa Flemming  Unlike other past presidents who live in private residences with tall fences or in gated communities, Trump has his official residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach.  The club is open to dues-paying members, who mingle with the former president at meals and at events and can invite their own guests to the property. Many nights, Trump holds court on the club's patio, playing DJ with his iPad. While president, he once plotted a response to a North Korean missile launch from the candlelit terrace. The club is also a popular Palm Beach venue and hosts a constant stream of fundraisers, weddings and other events that sometimes see Trump drop by unannounced. By Tessa Flemming  Karen Greenberg, a US national security expert, says we still know little verifiable information about how this apparent assassination attempt. She says she imagines a lot of the preliminary investigation will revolve around the suspect's access to an AK-47-style assault rifle. She also says it is interesting that the suspect waited for Trump to get closer, despite the former president being within shooting distance. \"Any distance that's in the proximity and shooting distance of the former president is too close,\" she tells ABC News Channel. \"But I think the key takeaway here is that they did stop this before it happened.\" Watch the interview here: By Tessa Flemming  An eyewitness to law enforcement officers' pursuit of the suspect in the apparent assassination said the ordeal left him and his family \"very, very scared\". Daniel Rodriguez, 16, said he was leaving a soccer game with his mother and father on Sunday afternoon when he witnessed law enforcement vehicles speeding past in pursuit of a black Nissan. The swarm of police, sheriff's deputies, and helicopters stopped traffic for roughly two hours, Mr Rodriguez said. Using a pair of binoculars, Mr Rodriguez was able to see officers with firearms drawn as they surrounded the suspect's vehicle. \"It looked like an intense stand-off,\" he said. Mr Rodriguez noted he couldn't see the suspect himself. Reporting with Reuters  By Georgie Hewson Reuters has shared images of law enforcement officers checking what it says is the former home of Ryan Wesley Routh in Greensboro, North Carolina. Routh has been indentified by Reuters, AP and US media as a suspect. By Tessa Flemming  Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, told CNN that the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt remained silent when he was apprehended by law enforcement. \"He knew enough to stay silent,\" Mr Aronberg told CNN.  \"He did not apparently speak to officers. He was calm. \"So, it looked like a person who has done this before, not necessarily this crime, but someone who has had repeated interactions with law enforcement.\" Mr Aronberg did not name the suspect but said he had a \"rap sheet\". By Georgie Hewson It is almost 1am in Florida but the investigation is still very much in the early stages. The FBI has not yet verified the identity of the man arrested but the Associated Press and multiple US media outlets have named 58-year-old Hawaiian man Ryan Wesley Routh as the suspect. The head of the Secret Service is on his way to Florida as the agency works with the FBI. North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan has the latest on where the investigation is at here: By Georgie Hewson An undated photograph shows Ryan Wesley Routh, a suspect identified by AP and US media, as the FBI investigates. The FBI has declined to comment and the ABC has not independently verified his identity. The ABC found profiles on X and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, who appeared to be the man identified as the suspect by those news organizations. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Donald Trump has posted to his Truth Social platform for the first time since the suspected assassination attempt. He's thanked the Secret Service agents on the ground and the local police officers in Florida who responded. \"I would like to thank everyone for your concern and well wishes - It was certainly an interesting day! \"Most importantly, I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE. \"THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!\" By Georgie Hewson In a post to X, US Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson posed for a photo with the former president at Mar-a-Lago this evening. He said he had spent time with Trump for a few hours and he and his wife were \"thanking God for protecting him today.\" By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in this year's election, Kamala Harris, has released a new statement on the incident. The vice-president says she's \"deeply disturbed\" by what happened and is \"thankful\" the former president is safe. \"As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence. \"I commend the US Secret Service and law enforcement partners for their vigilance. \"As President Biden said, our administration will ensure the Secret Service has every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to carry out its critical mission.\" By Georgie Hewson In case you missed it, here are the prime minister's brief comments about the apparent assassination attempt this morning. By Georgie Hewson Retired FBI special agent Kenneth Gray has spoken with ABC News channel. He says the fact the alleged shooter was allowed to get onto the Florida golf course raises questions about the protection afforded to Donald Trump. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan The secretary of Homeland Security says his agency and the Secret Service are working with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident.  Alejandro Mayorkas said the safety of presidential candidates and other \"protectees\" was the Secret Service's highest priority. By Georgie Hewson Donald Trump will likely be under an increased security detail next time he visits his Florida golf course, after Secret Service agents were forced to intercept a second apparent assassination attempt on the property's perimeter. You can read more about that here: By Heloise Vyas Ryan Wesley Routh, who AP and some US media have identified as the shooter, was convicted in 2002 of possessing a weapon of mass destruction, according to North Carolina Department of Adult Correction online records. The records do not provide details about the case. But a News & Record story from 2002 says a man with the same name was arrested after a three-hour standoff with police. The story says he was first pulled over during a traffic stop, but put his hand on \"a fully automatic machine gun\" and then drove to a business, where he barricaded himself inside. The man was later charged with carrying a concealed weapon and possessing a weapon of mass destruction, referring to machine gun, according to the News & Record. Weapons of mass destruction have a broad meaning in US firearms law. Homeland Security describes them as \"a nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, or other device that is intended to harm a large number of people\". Reporting with the Associated Press By Georgie Hewson Former US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has joined other US politicians in saying \"there is no place for violence of any kind in America\". By Georgie Hewson Australian author and commentator Don Watson paints a picture of the political and cultural landscape in the US amidst an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. He says he didn't find it surprising. \"You never know what's going to come out of the United States and this is just another one,\" he says. \"Six weeks ago the world was completely different, Biden was still running for president then, and it's all changed. \"I do notice that Kamala Harris says there is no place for violence in America, that's her standard response. \"Well of course that's a nonsense, violence plays an important part in America, it's central to America. \"This is a country where schools conduct weekly rituals of preparation for mass shootings, it's a heavily armed country. \"If you give people guns, they're going to use them.\" By Heloise Vyas Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, told American news outlet MSNBC that the charges against the suspect would be filed at the federal level.  This means the case will likely be taken over by the US Department of Justice. Mr Aronberg also said attempted assassination charges can be considered even if the accused hasn't fired a shot. Ron DeSantis, the governor for Florida, said the state would also conduct its \"own investigation\". \"The people deserve the truth about the would be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,\" he wrote on X.

The FBI has opened an investigation and the former president's campaign and the US Secret Service confirmed he is safe. The man has been arrested and investigations are underway into what was called a \"protective incident\". The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a potential assassination attempt on Donald Trump after a Secret Service agent opened fire on an armed man near the former president's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.  The incident occurred about 2pm Sunday, local time, while the Republican presidential candidate was golfing.  No injuries were reported. The man fled in an SUV and was later apprehended in a nearby county by local law enforcement, according to Martin Country Sheriff William D. Snyder.  In a briefing with local news media, he said that the driver \"was not displaying a lot of emotions\" when taken into custody.  \"He was not armed when we took him out of the car,\" the sheriff said.  Sheriff vehicles pictured near Trump International Golf Club on Sunday. (AP: Stephanie Matat) The man in custody is believed to be named Ryan Wesley Routh, three law enforcement officials told the Associated Press. The officials identified the suspect to the AP, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the ongoing investigation. Mr Trump's campaign confirmed he was safe and the US Secret Service said it was investigating what it called \"a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump\".  The presidential candidate sent an email to his fundraising list saying that there were \"gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiralling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\" \"Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me.\" Mr Trump, a keen golfer, was playing a round with friends at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.  Police are treating the incident as an assassination attempt on the former president.  (Reuters: Marco Bello) A Secret Service agent was one hole ahead of the former president when he spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence in the golf club, according to Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County.  \"Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman,\" said Rafael Barros from the Secret Service.  \"We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot at our agents.\"  After the man fled, an \"AK-47 style\" rifle was recovered from a bush where the suspect was seen, along with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro camera. Police displayed photos showing a rifle, backpack and Go-Pro camera on a fence outside the golf club. (AP: Stephany Matat) A witness then saw a man flee the scene.  \"Fortunately, we were able to locate a witness that came to us and said, 'hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes. He jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,' which was great,\" Sheriff Bradshaw said.  He was quickly apprehended.  Police stopped a vehicle near Palm City, Florida, and took a man into custody.  (Reuters: Martin County Sheriff's Office/Handout) The officials say Mr Trump was at least 365 metres away during the incident.  \"With a rifle and a scope like that, that's not a long distance,\" Sheriff Bradshaw said. The golf club where the shots were fired is about 6 kilometres from his main home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. Mr Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from a west coast campaign that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. Mr Trump often spends the morning playing golf, before having lunch at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, one of three he owns in the state. The incident comes roughly two months after an assassination attempt on Trump's life at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Some may consider the shooting of Donald Trump to be a worrying sign of a new era of political violence but unfortunately George Bush senior and junior, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and even Joe Biden have all faced security threats attempted assassinations. In July, the former president was holding a rally in Pennsylvania when he was shot in his right ear. Two people, including the suspected gunman, were killed and two were critically injured. He has had a stepped-up security footprint since the assassination attempt, and at outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. But Florida officials say because he is not a sitting president, the full golf course wasn't cordoned off — a security measure that would have been offered if he was in office.  \"If he was, we would have had the entire golf course surrounded,\" Sheriff Bradshaw said.  \"Because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.\"  Donald Trump is safe after gunshots were reported in his vicinity on Sunday afternoon, local time, in Florida. (AP: Alex Brandon) The White House said President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, had both been briefed and would be kept updated on the investigation, adding they were \"relieved\" to know Trump is safe. \"I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,\" Vice-President Harris wrote on social media.  \"Violence has no place in America.\" Mr Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, said he spoke to the former president after the incident.  \"I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,\" Vance said on X, formerly known as Twitter.  \"Still much we don't know, but I'll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude.\" Police were seen patrolling the area following reports of multiple shots fired near the golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida.  ( X via Reuters: @realDerekUtley) ABC/AP Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Police US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Several investigations into the July assassination attempt are still underway and details are still emerging about the golf course incident. Donald Trump will likely be under an increased security detail next time he visits his Florida golf course, after Secret Service agents were forced to intercept a second apparent assassination attempt on the property's perimeter. The FBI says Donald Trump was the target of what appears to be an attempted assassination at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. This is what we know. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Mr Trump's status as a former president meant his security detail was limited, compared to what it would have been during his presidency. An individual allegedly took aim at Mr Trump with an AK-47-style rifle through the golf course fence, before being spotted and fired on by Secret Service officials. Sheriff Bradshaw said had the incident occurred while Mr Trump was still the sitting president, \"the entire course would have been locked down\". \"You got to understand the golf course is surrounded by shrubbery, and once someone is in the shrubbery they're pretty much out of sight,\" he said. \"And at this level that [Donald Trump] is at right now, he's not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. \"Because he's not, the security is limited to the area that the Secret Service deems possible. \"I would imagine that next time he comes to the golf course, there will be a little more people around the perimeter. \"But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done, they provided exactly what the protection should have been, and their agent did a fantastic job.\" The incident comes just days after a Secret Service investigation confirmed security breakdowns made it possible for a would-be assassin to take aim at the former president at a rally in July. The internal investigation found along with failures on the ground at the Pennsylvania rally, the Secret Service was slow to beef up security for Mr Trump as his campaign unfolded. A summary of the findings have been shared with the Senate Homeland Security Committee and a House investigative task force but have not been released publicly yet. Secret Service director Ronald Rowe told the Washington Post he had begun an agency-wide review to harden the protective bubble around officials under the organisation's protection. Ronald Rowe has already spoken several times about the Secret Service organisation breakdowns which led to the Pennsylvania assassination attempt.  (Reuters: Kevin Mohatt) The outlet said he warned them doing so would cost money. \"The Secret Service cannot operate under the paradox of 'zero fail mission' while also making our special agents and uniformed division officers execute a very critical national security mission by doing more with less,\" he said in a statement. The Mar-a-Lago, a private club with open access for members and guests, has also long been the subject of security concerns. In 2018, an 18-year-old convinced Secret Service agents he was a club member by simply walking down the beach and joining the line for access. The teen later told a judge he \"wanted to see how far [he] could get\". Following the attack on Mr Trump in Pennsylvania, security had been increased around the property. A Palm Beach security alert said there would be \"enhanced security measures involving Mar-a-Lago and US Secret Service protected persons\" which would shut down roads from July 20. \"This closure will be in effect 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until the November general election at a minimum,\" the alert said. Several roads surrounding the property were closed indefinitely. Retired FBI agent Kenneth Gray, now a lecturer at the University of New Haven, told the ABC \"one does have to wonder why it is [the shooter] was able to get this close\". \"[Mr Trump] was one hole away, so 400, 500 yards away,\" he said. \"That is close enough that had the shooter wanted to take a shot then, he could have struck the president at that distance but instead he was waiting for the president to get closer. \"Strategically, as far as [the Secret Service] letting this happen the way it did, I have some questions about that. Of all the schisms that cleave contemporary America, few are more stark than the divide between those who consider themselves to be victims of US history and those who fear they will be casualties of its future. \"I'm sure the former president is very safe. This is his golf course in his territory, next to Mar-a-Lago and so I'm sure he felt very comfortable in that environment. \"But the Secret Service will have to try to make recommendations to the former president about ways and venues he should be going into that could keep him safer than what he actually is.\" In August, after complaints from residents and issues with traffic, Mar-a-Lago, the Secret Service and Palm Beach city officials reached a deal to have at least one road open when Trump was not at the club. The latest apparent assassination attempt has sparked a re-closure of roads, meaning only residents and visitors with identification will be allowed through security checkpoints. US President Joe Biden said in a statement he has directed his team to \"continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety\".  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Ryan Wesley Routh faces charges of possessing a firearm despite being a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Further charges appear likely, but the initial counts will allow authorities to keep him in custody as the investigation continues. Shackled and wearing a blue jumpsuit, Mr Routh appeared briefly in federal court in West Palm Beach on Monday morning, local time, where he answered basic questions about his work status and income.  Mr Routh was arrested on Sunday afternoon after a Secret Service agent spotted a firearm poking out of shrubbery on the West Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing.  Prosecutors asked that he remain locked up as a flight risk. A further hearing was set for September 23. An FBI affidavit shows how law enforcement officials, during their investigation, used Routh's cell phone information to place him at the golf course from 1:59am Sunday until about 1:31pm. A digital camera, a loaded rifle with scope and a plastic bag containing food was recovered from the area where Mr Routh had positioned himself, according to the affidavit. The Department of Justice said Mr Routh, of Hawaii, was convicted of multiple felony offences in North Carolina in 2002 and 2010. The Associated Press, citing court documents, reported they included two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002. Speaking in a soft voice in court on Monday, Mr Routh said that he was working and making around $3,000 a month, but has zero savings. Mr Routh said that he had no real estate or assets, aside from two trucks worth about $1,000, both located in Hawaii. He also said that he had a 25-year-old son, whom he sometimes supports. Mr Routh's lawyer, a public defender, did not make any comment. FBI special agent Jeffrey Veltri later said Mr Routh had \"an active online presence, and we are going through what he posted and any searches he conducted online\".  \"In addition, we're going through media reports and public statements he made that he wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers and others to fight for Ukraine.\" An investigation into the digital footprint of Donald Trump's alleged would-be assassin Ryan Routh paints a vivid and contradictory picture of his mindset. It was the second apparent assassination attempt targeting Trump in two months. On July 13, a bullet grazed Trump's ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a man in the crowd was killed. Secret Service director Kimberley Cheatle later resigned from her position. The Secret Service's acting director, Ronald Rowe, told a press conference on Monday he had ordered a \"paradigm shift\" in its \"protective methodologies\" since the assassination attempt in Butler. He said it had increased security for Trump following a request from President Joe Biden \"for the highest levels of protection\" for the former president, as well as for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Mr Routh did not have a line of sight to the former president as he waited by the golf course, and did not fire any shots at the Secret Service agent who spotted him, Mr Rowe said. \"The protective methodologies of the Secret Service were effective,\" he said. Trump defended the Secret Service's handling of the incident during a live interview with Rug Radio CEO Farokh Samard on X, formerly known as Twitter.  \"It was quite something, but it worked out well. And the Secret Service did an excellent job and they have the man behind bars and hopefully he's going to be there for a long time. Dangerous person. Very, very dangerous person,\" he said.  The presidential candidate said he was playing golf with friends when he suddenly heard several shots ring out.  \"The Secret Service knew immediately they were bullets, and they grabbed me … we got into the guard's [car] and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course.  \"I would have loved to have sank that last putt, but we decided, 'let's get out of here'. A Secret Service agent had seen a barrel of an AK-47, which is a very powerful gun rifle, and he started shooting at the barrel and started shooting in the bushes.\" President Biden said he was still waiting for a full report on the shooting.  \"But one thing I want to make clear is the Secret Service needs more help,\" he said.  \"And I think the Congress should respond to their needs if they, in fact, need more for the service.\" Look back at how ABC readers and other Australians responded to this live moment.

The Secret Service was tight-lipped when asked if there was any evidence suggesting the suspect knew Trump would be playing at the golf course on Sunday afternoon, local time. They said the investigation was still in its early stages. Ryan Wesley Routh did not fire a shot before fleeing the golf course, the Secret Service's acting director Ron Rowe said. Mr Rowe also defended the Secret Service's protections and said the alleged shooter was never in the line of sight of Trump.

For the second time this US election campaign, former US president Donald Trump has survived an assassination attempt at the hands of a would-be shooter. Once again it has sent the media and internet sleuths into a frenzy in an effort to find details about the motivation of the suspect, named by law enforcement as Ryan Wesley Routh. Using a comparison of Mr Routh's passport, with interconnected social media profiles and videos freely available online, ABC NEWS Verify has pieced together many of the details of the 58-year-old's activities in the years before this alleged assassination attempt. We've combed Mr Routh's digital detritus, much of which has been scrubbed from the internet, to piece together who he is. What we've found presents a chequered history, including attempts to fight in Ukraine, philanthropic work and deeply ambiguous political affiliations. Mr Routh's posts on social media platform X reveal a confusing and mercurial political history. The account has now been suspended, but ABC NEWS Verify made an archive of many of his posts and replies before they became unavailable. On X, Mr Routh claimed to have voted for Trump at the 2016 election in which the former president was propelled to power. Alleged would-be assassin Ryan Routh posted on X that he had voted for Trump in 2016, but no longer supported him. (X/@ryanrouth) In March 2020 he posted in support of Hawaiian Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard as she vied for the party's nomination for president. (Though Ms Gabbard was a member of the Democratic Party at the time, she has since left the party due to what she has described as \"growing wokeness, fomenting racism, and intolerance\" and has recently endorsed Trump for this year's election.) Mr Routh also appeared to throw his support behind the very left wing of the Democratic Party, endorsing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders at the same time as he cheered on Ms Gabbard. Ryan Routh posted on Twitter about his preference for Bernie Sanders over Joe Biden.  (X/@ryanrouth) By early June 2020 he was publicly lamenting that former Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton was not running with then-former vice-president Joe Biden. Other tweets from 2020 are critical of Joe Biden, parroting Trump's favourite description of him as \"Sleepy Joe\". Yet on the same day he appeared open to a second Trump term, penning advice to the then-president on how to get re-elected amid protests following the death of black man George Floyd in Minnesota. Ryan Routh gave Donald Trump advice on how to get re-elected in the midst of the George Floyd unrest. (X/@ryanrouth) By June 11, 2020, his attitude towards Trump appeared to have soured completely. Mr Routh referred to him as \"retarded\", adding that he would be glad when Trump is gone. It appears Mr Routh made a series of small donations to Democratic fundraiser Act Blue in 2019 and 2020, with his name and state of residence (Hawaii) appearing in the US Federal Election Commission database. Ryan Routh suggested an alliance between candidates for the Republican presidential nomination Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. (X/@ryanrouth) Overall, his X history offers few consistent clues as to his political motivation for attempting an assassination, beyond an expressed dislike of Trump. Social media posts on X and LinkedIn indicate that Mr Routh has taken a keen interest in Ukraine's defence, including a willingness to fight. This evolved into actively recruiting foreign fighters for the war. Ryan Routh posted several times on X that he was willing to travel to Ukraine to fight. (X/@ryanrouth) In late March Mr Routh travelled from Hawaii to Ukraine via Poland, according to tweets from his X account. In June 2022 he appeared in an interview with Newsweek Romania while he was allegedly in Kyiv. The then 56-year-old described being rejected as a volunteer due to his age and lack of military experience, adding that instead he was focusing his efforts on recruiting other foreigners to join, mentioning that he had helped place a 74-year-old Japanese man in a Ukrainian unit and describing the fight as one between good and evil. The websites Fight for Ukraine and Taiwan Foreign Legion both list him as a recruitment contact and contain links to his personal social media and phone number. Would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh was an avid recruiter for the war in Ukraine. (n NewsTaiwa) Ryan Routh posted pictures of himself in Washington and Ukraine as he attempted to recruit fighters for the eastern-European nation. (LinkedIn/Ryan Routh) According to Taiwanese sources, the ABC understands Mr Routh briefly travelled to Taiwan in June 2023 via Istanbul before departing to Japan. However, Mr Routh's efforts at recruitment of foreign fighters for Ukraine appear to have hit some hurdles. In August last year he posted: \"Ukraine does not want Afghan soldiers. I tried for 6 months to get them to accept Afghans and they do not want them in their country.\" That same month he promoted the \"Taiwan Foreign Legion\" on X, claiming that he wanted to start a foreign legion to \"protect the shores of Taiwan\". In his desperation for support he even tagged Elon Musk in April this year asking him whether he could purchase a rocket from the billionaire owner of SpaceX for the purpose of using it to assassinate Vladimir Putin. ABC NEWS Verify was able to confirm that Ryan Routh was interviewed by Newsweek Romania in June 2022 based on the following data points: Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine becoming a central focus for Mr Routh, he used social media to promote his business Camp Box Honolulu which advertised small affordable house kits aimed at Hawaiian residents. One of the small houses built by Ryan Routh's business Camp Box Honolulu. (Camp Box Honolulu) Mr Routh, the owner according to LinkedIn, is seen in multiple photos and videos on the company's website working on tiny home kits.The two business reviews available on the company's Facebook page are negative, mentioning poor workmanship and an interaction with \"the owner Ryan\" who allegedly told an unhappy customer that \"he was disappointed with the kind of human being\" that they were. Mr Routh's tweets prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 indicate he was focused on local issues such as road closures and homelessness. Peppered among these posts on local issues, however, were several tweets dating back to 2020 suggesting that he fervently believed he could impact politics across the globe.For instance, in August and September 2020 Mr Routh attempted to contact the then-South Korean president Moon Jae-in, calling on him to work with North Korea to improve relations between the hermit kingdom and the United States. This interest in peacemaking followed an earlier offer aimed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in which he suggested he could work as an \"ambassador and liaison\" to help \"end disagreement and sanctions\".Throughout 2020 Mr Routh also posted about protests in Belarus and Hong Kong, suggesting that people fleeing those conflicts should come to Hawaii, including sharing his home address for anyone who wished to \"come and stay forever\". What we have yet to determine from Mr Routh's eclectic and at times contradictory online presence is any indication or warning that he was allegedly imminently planning to attack Donald Trump. This is no doubt something that US authorities will be digging into further in the coming hours and days.

(Reuters: Lothar Speer) With a digital camera, black plastic bag of food, and loaded SKS-style rifle, Ryan Routh arrived at Donald Trump's Palm Beach golf course and waited for almost 12 hours. Court documents have provided details of the allegations against the 58-year-old after the second apparent assassination attempt against the former president.  Mr Routh made a brief federal court appearance in Florida on Monday, local time, where he faced two gun charges. The initial criminal counts will allow authorities to keep Mr Routh in custody as the investigation continues.  And experts say more serious charges are likely to be laid. This is what we learned from Mr Routh's first court appearance, documents provided to the court, and what could happen next. The Martin County Sheriff's Office released this image of Ryan Routh after his arrest. (Supplied: Martin County Sheriff's Office) The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) has said former president Trump was the target of \"what appears to be an attempted assassination\" at his golf club in West Palm Beach on Sunday. A Secret Service agent fired at Mr Routh when he was spotted in the bushes with a rifle as Trump played golf a few hundred metres away. The suspect allegedly fled the scene but was arrested about 40 minutes later driving north on Interstate 95. Shackled and wearing a blue jumpsuit, Mr Routh briefly appeared in court on Monday where he faced two federal weapons charges: Prosecutors asked that Mr Routh remain locked up as a flight risk.  (Reuters: Lothar Speer ) Dr Harry Melkonian, a practising lawyer and honorary associate at the United States Studies Centre, said the charges were significant. The first count alleges that Mr Routh illegally possessed his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina.  The other charge alleges that the serial number was \"obliterated and unreadable to the naked eye\", in violation of federal law.  \"The charges are quite substantial and carry heavy penalties,\" Dr Melkonian said. \"The first carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, it's not a minor charge.\" He could face five years in prison if convicted on the second charge. A detention hearing has been scheduled for Mr Routh on September 23.\n\n \n\n  (Reuters: Marco Bello) Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, told American news outlet MSNBC that attempted assassination charges could be considered even if the accused had not fired a shot. The man suspected of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump camped outside a golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours before being spotted by the Secret Service, according to court documents. So far, there has been no evidence that Mr Routh fired his gun and the Secret Service said he \"did not have a line of sight to the former president\". The incident comes just two months after another armed man was able to take aim at Trump, grazing his ear with a bullet during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Dr Melkonian said at this stage of the investigation, charging Mr Routh with weapons-related crimes would be a lot easier than trying to prove he intended to shoot the Republican presidential candidate. \"In order to justify the arrest, they (investigators) had to show to the judge some basic probable cause for the arrest, and that's what this was all about,\" he said. \"From a prosecution standpoint, charging someone who is not qualified to have a gun with possessing a gun is a lot easier than trying to prove that someone intended to shoot Donald Trump.\" According to a \"probable cause\" criminal complaint filed by FBI special agent Mark Thomas, mobile phone data indicates that Mr Routh \"was located in the vicinity of the area of the tree line\" at the Trump International Golf Course from just before 2am Sunday until about 1:30pm. A Secret Service agent had been walking the perimeter of the golf course when he spotted what appeared to be a rifle poking out of the tree at 1:31pm and the agent opened fire.  Mr Routh could have therefore been camped out at the scene for nearly 12 hours before he was noticed. Mr Trump was golfing at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, when a gunman was spotted at the property.  (Reuters: Marco Bello) During their investigations, law enforcement officials allege they discovered a publicly viewable Facebook post from about July 10 from Mr Routh, directing his followers to contact him on a WhatsApp number. Authorities were able to confirm the number belonged to Mr Routh, and contacted T-Mobile to provide mobile phone usage data that placed him at the golf course on Sunday. Mr Routh allegedly fled the area after coming under fire from the agent, getting in a Nissan sport utility vehicle and driving off  \"at a rate of high speed\".  Court documents say he left behind: Photos show an AK-47-style rifle, a backpack and a Go-Pro camera on a fence outside Trump International Golf Club. (AP: Stephany Matat) The serial number on the SKS-style \"was unreadable to the naked eye,\" Mr Thomas wrote. He added that from his \"training and experience\" he was aware that SKS-style, 7.62x39 calibre rifles, were not manufactured in the state of Florida. \"Therefore, I submit that there is probable cause that to believe that the SKS-style rifle, which was seized from the tree line at Trump International, have previously travelled in interstate or foreign commerce,\" he stated.  Ryan Routh made a brief appearance in a Florida court. (Reuters: Social media ) Mr Routh was convicted in North Carolina of multiple felony counts of possession of stolen goods, according to the criminal complaint. This included a felony for possession of a weapon of mass destruction in 2002. Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe concluded there was probable cause to charge Mr Routh with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession and receipt of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. A detention hearing has been scheduled for September 23. Charges in a federal criminal complaint are preliminary, and typically need a grand jury indictment before the case can proceed.  Dr Melkonian said prosecutors often used that time to add additional counts, and the grand jury \"tends to do what the prosecutor ask\". He added that the state of Florida may also lay charges. At a federal level, threatening the life of a former president only carried a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment, Dr Melkonian said. \"The assassination statutes, which include attempted assassinations, don't apply to someone who isn't president,\" he said. \"But if there's going to be a state of Florida prosecution, I suspect they won't do anything until the federal case is over.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Courts and Trials Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Courts and Trials US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Piroschka van de Wouw) Kamala Harris's presidential campaign has become a target for Russian disinformation groups online, Microsoft said in a report on the US election. Several videos making untrue claims about Ms Harris, her campaign and policies have been distributed online by groups linked to the Kremlin.  Microsoft said the disinformation, designed to \"spread discord\", would likely escalate in the lead up to the November 5 presidential election. Kamala Harris's bid for the US presidency has become a key target of Russian disinformation campaigners, according to Microsoft.  Groups aligned with or backed by the Kremlin have shifted noticeably from targeting only the Republican campaign of nominee Donald Trump to Ms Harris's campaign alongside her vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, a Microsoft cybersecurity report released on Tuesday said.  Microsoft identified two Russian actors, called Storm-1516 and Storm-1679, responsible for creating deepfake or misleading videos published online. A series of wire transfers worth millions of dollars to a conservative US media network disguised a web of Russian disinformation and propaganda. The goal, according to the report, was to \"sow discord and spread disinformation\" about Ms Harris and her campaign as the 2024 Democratic nominee.  Storm-1516, labelled a \"Kremlin-aligned troll farm\" produced a deepfake video that used an actor to re-enact a claim about Ms Harris being involved in a hit-and-run accident in 2011 that allegedly paralysed a young girl.  The accident in question never occurred, and the group used a newly set up site pretending to be a local San Franciscan media outlet to distribute the video.  Another video created by Storm-1516 showed an alleged attack on a Trump rally attendee by Harris supporters, which also never occurred.  Both videos received millions of views. Microsoft said the decision of Joe Biden to retire from the 2024 presidential race meant the Russian disinformation groups \"initially struggled\" to refocus, but had pivoted to the Harris-Walz campaign in the last two months. The second disinformation group, Storm-1679, also posted videos promoting conspiracy theories and inaccurate claims about Ms Harris's policies. \"Disseminating conspiracies leveraging divisive social issues is part of Storm-1679's playbook for driving engagement with content,\" Microsoft said. A number of other disinformation and hacking campaigns coming from Russia are targeting the US election, according to the report, many of which function covertly to spread influence online. Microsoft also noted Chinese and Iranian-linked groups focusing on the 2024 US elections and targeting both the Democrat and Republican campaigns. An escalation in inaccurate claims from groups like Storm-1679 in the weeks leading up to the November 5 poll was likely, the report said. Tech company Meta announced a ban on Russian state media networks RT, Rossiya Segodnya and others from its social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, claiming the outlets had tried to carry out covert influence operations online. The internet is awash with fake images. Here's how to not drown in them. The ban is a sharp escalation in measures by the world's biggest social media company against Russian state media, after years of more limited steps such as blocking the outlets from running ads and reducing the reach of their posts. Meta said the entities were banned from its apps globally for \"foreign interference activity\" in a statement on Monday. A spokesperson for YouTube also said the company terminated over 230 channels affiliated with Rossiya Segodnya and AVO TV Novosti, which were already blocked from viewers. Prior to the ban, RT had more than 7.2 million followers on Facebook and more than 1 million followers on Instagram. The Kremlin heavily criticised the move, saying Meta was \"discrediting itself with these actions\".  Moscow branded Meta an \"extremist\" organisation in 2022 and blocked Instagram and Facebook, objecting to changes in Meta's hate speech policy designed to allow users to vent their anger over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

(Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Preliminary findings of a Secret Service investigation into the handling of Donald Trump's attempted assassination in July have detailed wide-ranging security failures on the agency's part. These include poor communication with local police, a failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities and \"complacency\" among some Secret Service agents. A final report is still being completed, while several other US government inquiries into the agency's handling of the event remain ongoing. Communication breakdowns with local law enforcement hampered the US Secret Service's performance during a July campaign rally where former president Donald Trump was shot and wounded, according to new findings released by the agency. The Secret Service published a five-page document on Friday summarising the key conclusions of a yet-to-be-finalised report that lays bare the cascading and wide-ranging failings that preceded the July 13 shooting. It found a number of missed opportunities to stop the gunman, who opened fire from an unsecured roof at the campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. The near-assassination of Donald Trump was a seminal moment in US history. Through multiple live streams, map data, and eyewitness videos, here's how the rally shooting played out over 11 minutes and 9 seconds. Those include an absence of clear guidance from the Secret Service to local law enforcement, the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and \"complacency\" among some agents, said Ronald Rowe Jr, the agency's acting director. Though the failed response has been well-documented through congressional testimony, news media investigations and other public statements, the summary document released on Friday marks the Secret Service's most formal attempt to catalogue the errors of the day and comes amid fresh scrutiny of the agency following Sunday's arrest of a man who authorities say stalked Trump at a Florida golf course. \"This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service,\" Mr Rowe said at a news conference accompanying the release of the summary. \"It's important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again.\" The full document is still being finalised. The report details a series of \"communications deficiencies\" before the shooting by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds in Trump's direction from the roof of a building less than 140 metres from where Trump was speaking. That building had been identified as a possible hazard before the event, Mr Rowe said, yet officials did not take appropriate steps to correct the potential problems. Trump surrounded by US Secret Service agents after being shot in the ear. (AP: Evan Vucci) \"Line-of-sight issues were acknowledged, but not properly mitigated. Issues were encountered the day of the visit with respect to line-of-sight concerns, but they were not escalated to supervisors,\" Mr Rowe said. \"While some members of the advanced team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols.\" Among the other problems: \"The failure of personnel to broadcast via radio the description of the assailant, or vital information received from local law enforcement regarding a suspicious individual on the roof of the AGR complex, to all federal personnel at the Butler site, inhibited the collective awareness of all Secret Service personnel,\" the report said. AGR refers to AGR International Inc, a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where the rally was held. That breakdown was especially problematic for Trump's protective detail, \"who were not apprised of how focused state and local law enforcement were in the minutes leading up to the attack on locating the suspicious subject\". Had they known, the report says, they could have made the decision to relocate Trump while the search for the gunman was in progress. The report raises more serious questions about why no law enforcement were stationed on the roof Crooks climbed onto before opening fire. A local tactical team was stationed on the second floor of a building in the complex he fired from. Would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School with the Class of 2022.\n\n\n  (Supplied: Bethel Park School District) Multiple law enforcement entities questioned the effectiveness of the team's position, \"yet there was no follow-up discussion\" about changing it, the report says. And there was no discussion with the Secret Service about putting a team on the roof, even though snipers from local law enforcement agencies \"were apparently not opposed to that location\". The tactical team operating on the second floor of the building had no contact with the Secret Service before the rally. That team was brought in by a local police department to help with the event, without the Secret Service's knowledge, the report says. The Secret Service understood in advance that the rally site, selected by Trump's staff because it better accommodated the \"large number of desired attendees\", was a security challenge because of lines of sight that could be exploited by a would-be attacker. And yet, the report said, no security measures were taken on July 13 to remove those concerns and the Secret Service lacked detailed knowledge about the local law enforcement support that would even be in place. Officials say if Donald Trump was still the president, \"the entire course\" would have been in lockdown when an alleged would-be assassin took aim. The report's executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame, nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. Then-director Kimberly Cheatle resigned more than a week after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse. The Secret Service's investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector-general office. Mr Rowe has said the July shooting and Sunday's episode — in which 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after Secret Service agents detected a rifle poking through shrubbery lining the West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where Trump was playing — underscore the need for a paradigm shift in how the agency protects public officials. Trump, he said, was receiving the \"highest levels\" of protection and the Secret Service response in Florida was an example of procedures working as they should.

(Reuters: Social media ) The man accused of plotting to shoot Donald Trump allegedly wrote a letter about an assassination attempt months prior. Prosecutors have told the court Ryan Routh had an 'easy shot' at where Trump would have been golfing, had a Secret Service agent not intervened.  Prosecutors have indicated they want to charge him with attempted assassination of a political candidate. The US Justice Department plans to charge the man accused of hiding with a gun at former president Donald Trump's Florida golf course with attempting to assassinate a major political candidate. The appearance of Ryan Routh, 58, in court came after revelations he'd allegedly written a letter months prior to his arrest, which made reference to a failed assassination attempt on Trump and offered money to anyone who could \"complete the job\". Appearing in court on Monday, local time, Mr Routh was ordered by US Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe to remain in jail without bond pending trial on two gun-related charges brought against him after his September 15 arrest.  Judge McCabe said prosecutors had documented Mr Routh's effort to \"stalk\" Trump during a roughly month-long period in south Florida \"in an apparent attempt to assassinate him\". Prosecutor Mark Dispoto said the Justice Department would ask a grand jury to bring the more serious attempted assassination charge against Mr Routh, who was handcuffed and shackled at the waist during the hearing, in which prosecutors detailed some of the evidence collected against him. Mr Routh wrote a letter, prosecutors said, months earlier referencing an \"assassination attempt\" on the Republican presidential candidate and a $150,000 bounty on his life. He also assembled a \"sniper's nest\" near the sixth hole of Trump's West Palm Beach golf club in an attempt to kill him, Mr Dispoto said, but was stopped when a US Secret Service agent opened fire after spotting a rifle poking through the fence. The man suspected of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump camped outside a golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours before being spotted by the Secret Service, according to court documents. \"This was an easy shot,\" Mr Dispoto said of Mr Routh's position, adding that Trump would have arrived in that area roughly 15 minutes later. Lawyers representing Mr Routh unsuccessfully sought his release on a $250,000 bond, questioning the prosecution's evidence and arguing that Mr Routh has attempted to aid democracies including Ukraine and Taiwan. Mr Routh wore a navy blue jumpsuit during the hearing and did not speak. Prosecutors said that several months prior to the incident, Mr Routh dropped off at the home of an unidentified civilian witness a box including ammunition, a metal pipe, four phones and a handwritten letter addressed to \"the world\" that offered a bounty on Trump. \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,\" the suspect wrote, according to a court filing by prosecutors. \"I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.\" Kristy Militello, a lawyer representing Mr Routh, argued that the letter indicated \"an intent to fail\" at the assassination. \"Perhaps this was more of a publicity stunt than anything,\" Ms Militello said. FBI special agent Christian Hull, who testified during the hearing, revealed that another letter had been found near Mr Routh's alleged perch at the golf course that was addressed to The New York Times. He did not reveal its contents and it was not used as evidence by the prosecution. Donald Trump has labelled the charges faced by Mr Routh as a slap on the wrist. (Reuters: David Dee Delgado) Prosecutors also said that when Mr Routh was arrested this month, his car contained a handwritten list of dates in August, September and October of places where Trump had appeared or was expected to appear.  They said a search of his mobile phone records showed that the devices had pinged towers near the Trump International golf course where the incident occurred and by the Mar-a-Lago resort where Trump lives. Mr Routh so far has been charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He has not yet entered a plea. In a statement on Monday, Trump called the charges inadequate, saying, \"The charges brought against the maniac assassin are a slap on the wrist.\" Mr Routh fled after being fired upon by the Secret Service agent and was later arrested along a Florida highway, according to a criminal complaint. US officials have said Mr Routh did not fire a shot during the encounter at the golf course and did not have a line of sight to Trump, who was a few hundred yards (metres) away. The incident came about two months after another gunman wounded Trump on the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. That gunman was shot and killed by the Secret Service. The pair of incidents revealed the agency's strains at a time of rising political threats and violence in the United States. Mr Routh, a struggling roofing contractor who most recently lived in Hawaii, had a criminal history. He was a vocal supporter of Ukraine who was interviewed about his quixotic effort to recruit Afghans to fight against Russia's invasion. In December 2002, Mr Routh was convicted in North Carolina of possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction. He was also convicted of possessing stolen goods in 2010, according to court records.

The bipartisan House of Representatives committee tasked with investigating the July shooting has released a report, describing in detail the minutes leading up to shots being fired. One man was killed in the attack, and two others were critically injured. All three were civilians attending the rally. Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old nursing aide, was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper at the scene. \"Crooks was in the United States Secret Service (USSS) counter sniper's sights for 'mere seconds' before [the sniper] fired,\" the report said. The report found the Secret Service had failed to \"clearly define responsibilities for planning and security\". It also found the Secret Service had failed to ensure the building used by Crooks was properly secured, did not \"effectively coordinate\" with state and local law enforcement, denied requests for resources and failed to communicate with key personnel. Technical problems also plagued officers, at some points leaving systems inoperable for hours at a time. The near-assassination of Donald Trump was a seminal moment in US history. Through multiple live streams, map data, and eyewitness videos, here's how the rally shooting played out over 11 minutes and 9 seconds. The detail in the report offers the most precise timeline to date of the assassination attempt as it unfolded.  At 3.51pm on the day of the shooting, Crooks flew a drone \"approximately 200 yards from the Farm Show grounds\". He had arrived at the venue early that day, before leaving and returning to stream video from the drone for about 11 minutes. A counter unmanned aircraft system (C-UAS) set up at the scene was inoperable until 4.33pm, meaning the drone went undetected. \"[Had] the C-UAS system been active and detected Mr Crooks' drone, the CUAS Advance Agent stated he would have sent USSS personnel to conduct a voluntary interview with Mr Cooks to determine the purpose of his flight,\" the report said. \"[Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe] testified … that the outage of the C-UAS system had cost him 'a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant'. \"[He] testified that perhaps had the C-UAS system been operational at 3.51pm, USSS agents would have spoken with Crooks and he could have decided not to go through with [the attempt].\" The FBI said digital evidence showed Crooks walking \"past a row of vendors outside the secure perimeter\" about 800 metres away from the American Glass Research (AGR) building at 4.26pm. Snipers were positioned inside the building, the rooftop of which Crooks would later use as his vantage point. A large crowd was present for the Pennsylvania rally.  As one exited the building at the end of his shift, he noticed a \"suspicious person\" and texted the two snipers still inside. \"Someone followed our lead and snuck in and parked by our cars just so you know,\" he wrote, according to the report. \"I'm just letting you know because you see me go out with my rifle and put it in my car so he knows you guys are up there. \"He's sitting to the direct right on a picnic table about 50 yards from the exit.\" At 5.10pm, law enforcement had their first confirmed sighting of Crooks, \"one hour and one minute before the shooting\". A local sniper set up in a window inside the AGR building watched him walk past. Four minutes later at 5.14pm, that sniper took a photo of Crooks with his phone. \"That sniper later told the committee that he was not sure at the time why he took the photograph, but that something seemed off about the individual,\" the report said. The sniper continued to watch Crooks \"looking at [his] phone, news feeds\" and a rangefinder, a small device used by hunters to measure distance. At 5.38pm, he texted two photographs of Crooks to other local snipers posted around the building and the rally grandstands. \"Kid learning [sic] around building we are in,\" he wrote. \"I did see him with a rangefinder looking toward stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.\" The message added a backpack and a bike that had not been seen earlier was left by the rear of the building. After sending the message, a sniper went to the AGR building's exit in an attempt to keep track of Crooks. At 5.42pm, the sniper who had first seen Crooks repeated his warning, telling other local law enforcement on their radio channel of a \"younger white male long hair [sic] lurking around\". (Image: Google/Airbus) An emergency services unit (ESU) commander responded at 5.43pm: \"Copy. We will send somebody to check it.\" At 5.44pm, Secret Service officials got their first confirmed communication about Crooks, \"approximately 27 minutes before the shooting\". About the same time, Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) officers and a Butler County sheriff's deputy were told about the suspicious person. A minute later at 5.45pm, the Butler ESU commander said via radio that Pennsylvania State Police and the sheriff's department \"should be en route\". More officials, including members of the sniper team, were now starting to text back and forth about the search for Crooks, including swapping photos. At 5.47pm, two undercover state police officers stationed at a nearby petrol station were told to go to the AGR building. The Butler ESU commander texted the state police sergeant stationed in the Secret Service's security room at 5.48pm, repeating the description and including photos of Crooks. According to the report, a Secret Service agent then sent the photos to a USSS Counter Sniper Response Team agent at 5.52pm. \"At the same time, the USSS Counter Sniper Team Leader who had received the description of and photographs of Crooks … then sent a 'be on the look out' or 'BOLO' email to all three other USSS counter snipers positioned on the two barn roofs behind the stage,\" the report said. At 5.54pm, the Butler ESU commander sent a radio transmission, noting Crooks was \"headed towards the stage\". \"Our [local sniper] units lost visual of him,\" he said. \"I believe you guys are outside that fence if you come upon him.\" A minute later, a local officer confirmed there was a police unit present, but that an officer sent to look hadn't seen Crooks. At 6pm, former president Donald Trump took the stage at the rally, an hour after he was scheduled to appear. At 6.02pm, the sniper who had taken the photo of Crooks got back on the radio: \"Alright subject is in between the AGR buildings. \"He's got a backpack now. He just went towards Sheetz [petrol station].\" At 6.03pm, the Butler ESU commander called the state police sergeant to relay the information, who called the police officer nearby. He told him: \"That guy's back. He's walking between buildings. He's headed towards the Sheetz.\" The two undercover officers were sent the photograph of Crooks. The report said that according to the FBI, Crooks \"climbed up an air conditioning unit onto a roof on the north end of the AGR complex\" at 6.05pm. \"He then moved southward across the connected AGR buildings' roofs with the backpack,\" the report said. \"FBI later stated that … 'video from local business, police dash cam, and police body cameras confirmed the subject's movement across [the rooftops] between 6.05pm and 6.08pm. \"'Our overall assessment is the subject was only on the roof for approximately six minutes prior to the shooting between 6.05pm and 6.11pm.'\" At 6.06pm, the local sniper met police officers at the AGR exit, to let them know Crooks was \"around [the] building on [the] side of [the] fairgrounds\". \"Around the same time, a USSS counter sniper … behind the stage 'saw two white vehicles pull into the AGR parking lot' and saw a police officer emerge from one of the two vehicles and begin 'moving urgently',\" the report said. On a Secret Service radio channel, that same sniper said local police were \"working something at the three o'clock, approximately 200 yards out\". At 32 seconds after 6.08pm, a local police officer radioed: \"Someone's on the roof … I have someone on the roof with white shorts.\" A minute later, the same officer radioed again. \"We got him, we don't have him in custody yet, but he's right straight in front of me by the pine tree standing upwards,\" he said. Seconds later he said they had \"lost sight of him\" and were chasing Crooks, \"trying to follow him around the building\". According to the report, body camera footage from local police showed Secret Service snipers moving to face the AGR building \"between 6.10.08 and 6.10.17\". At 6.11pm, a police officer \"was lifted up to the roof by another officer,\" the report said. The officer told the committee when he got over the top of the roof, he saw Crooks aiming a gun at him. \"I thought I was f***ed because all he had to do was pull the trigger,\" the officer said. \"So my hands came off and I went back down onto the concrete.\" He then radioed other officers: \"He's armed! I saw him, he's laying down! … He's got a long gun!\" The suspected shooter in a prone firing position facing the stage where Trump was speaking. (Supplied: TMZ) At the same time, a member of Mr Trump's Secret Service protective detail contacted their field office counterpart \"to inquire about the radio update that there was an issue local law enforcement was looking into\". \"Uniformed officers were seen running with their hands on their weapons, and rally attendees were seen running away from the AGR building,\" the report said. Crooks fired \"an initial volley of three shots\" 25 seconds after 6.11pm. One of these shots struck the former president in the ear. Crooks fired another five shots as Secret Service officers rushed the stage and covered Mr Trump. A local police officer told the committee he had seen \"Crooks's head and part of his shoulders\", watching him fire the eighth round as the officer shouldered his weapon. \"[I] saw the gas come from the muzzle, I heard the snap, and then immediately I returned fire,\" he testified. \"[Crooks] went down and slowly came back up. \"As he was coming back up, I was ready to press the second one, and that's when [the Secret Service sniper] took him out. \"He went down. He wasn't, like, getting down like a reaction. He slowly slumped over … and then slowly came back up and then got taken out.\" According to the report, the sniper \"said to his partner, 'I got him,' meaning he had Crooks in his sights\". \"At approximately 6.11.40, that USSS counter sniper fired a single shot that killed Crooks,\" the report said. Crooks was pronounced dead by a emergency services paramedic at 6.25pm.

(AAP: Dean Lewins) Former treasurer Joe Hockey has issued a warning that either a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris presidency could be damaging to the US economy. Mr Hockey says protectionist policies have had a ripple effect globally and would continue to do so. Mr Hockey said it was still too hard to tell whether the Republican or Democrat was more likely to win the coming election. Former federal treasurer and Australian ambassador to Washington Joe Hockey predicts a \"rocky time\" on global currency markets as both US presidential candidates embrace destabilising high-debt, deficit and tariff policies. \"If half of what Donald Trump is promising is implemented, or if what [Kamala] Harris is promising is implemented, America's economy is going to have substantial and significant structural problems,\" Mr Hockey told the National Press Club on Thursday. Mr Hockey, who now runs a consultancy for businesses seeking to trade between the US and Australia, said he expected the US dollar to weaken under either leader, particularly under Mr Trump because of policies such as his vow to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports to 60 per cent of their value. \"It is singularly the worst election campaign in living memory for anyone that cares about economics. It is ground zero in terms of making promises that are unfunded and probably cannot be delivered,\" Mr Hockey said. He said with both Democrats and Republicans \"absolutely hell-bent\" on big tariffs, \"what happens in America right now represents the greatest sovereign risk for business and for countries around the world\". Last week the prime minister finally sounded like he was setting the agenda rather than constantly dodging hits, but a question from the US presidential debate could prove dangerous closer to the election. Mr Hockey said the impacts of America's shift towards protectionism had global ripples, including in Australia where the Albanese government was forced to adopt domestic made-in-Australia policies in response to President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which squeezed out Chinese-made EVs. That forced China to dump electric vehicles in Europe, where Volkswagen and others are now closing down plants. \"Tariffs in the US, domestic policies in the US, tax policies in the US, immigration policies — they all have a profound impact in Australia and the rest of the world.\" Mr Hockey also told the National Press Club he had told the Republican directly that his \"policy platform is absurd in its largesse\". \"He can't keep spending. I mean he ran massive deficits … to the extent that today America's interest bill is bigger than what it spends on defence right now,\" he said. In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr Hockey also cautioned against losing public support for hundreds of billions of dollars in AUKUS and other military spending if the money only goes overseas. While Australia has many smaller companies involved in national security, they are largely starved of capital, unlike in the US and Europe where large-scale \"prime\" defence-industry giants like BAE help fund innovation and promising start-ups. \"We're one of only two or three countries in the world that hasn't got a major defence prime in the top 20,\" he said. \"I have been adamant and continue to be adamant that if AUKUS and all these other things are just Australian taxpayers writing out a cheque to America or Britain, then you'll soon lose public support. \"Australians won't cop it.\" On the US election, Mr Hockey said the outcome was still too difficult to predict, and said there is a scenario in which both candidates were tied in the Electoral College vote. To clinch the White House, he said, Ms Harris needs to win the popular vote by at least 2.5 per cent. Despite her current momentum, the vice-president is still to differentiate herself from Mr Biden. Mr Hockey said that would make it difficult to convince \"Mary Milwaulkee\" — average, low- and middle-income conservative voters who could decide the election. \"My residual concern for the Harris campaign is that she still remains too much of a mystery to Mary Milwaulkee,\" he said.

(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) The US government has committed billions more in military assistance for Ukraine, taking its total funding to $US175 billion since Russia's 2022 invasion.  President Joe Biden announced the new package after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House this week. Mr Zelenskyy will meet Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in New York on Friday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has secured a further $US8 billion ($11.5 billion) in military assistance from the United States in a major commitment made by President Joe Biden during the Ukrainian leader's visit to Washington.  Mr Zelenskyy met with Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris — Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in the presidential race — at the White House on Thursday, local time, where he presented his \"victory plan\" for Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  Details of the plan have been kept secret but White House officials said it contained initiatives and steps Mr Zelenskyy believes are important to end the war and prevent another.  Later on Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Trump announced he would also meet with the Ukrainian president on Friday, despite having criticised him on his campaign trail and expressed doubts about Ukraine's ability to defeat Russia. Kamala Harris said Ukraine had the unwavering support of the United States. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Mr Zelenskyy has long sought a meeting with Trump. The two men spoke by phone in July but have not met in person since Trump's term as president ended in 2021.  \"President Zelenskyy has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower (in New York),\" he said during a press conference.  Asked by a reporter if Ukraine might have to give up any of its territory to reach a peace deal with Moscow — a non-starter for Kyiv — Trump did not rule it out: \"We'll see what happens.\" Shortly before his comments, Ms Harris pledged support for Ukraine and — in a veiled reference to Trump — said those who would have Ukraine swap land for peace with Russia were supporting \"proposals of surrender\". She was speaking alongside Mr Zelenskyy at the White House, a day after Trump assailed him for not making a deal with Russia that he claims could have ended the war. It was Ms Harris's seventh meeting with the Ukrainian president and the third this year. Earlier in the week Trump looked poised to reject Mr Zelenskyy's meeting request.  Many congressional Republicans have been furious about Mr Zelenskyy's visit on Sunday to an arms factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Mr Biden's hometown.  The Republican-led House Oversight Committee opened an investigation into the trip to determine whether the Biden administration used taxpayer funds to fly Mr Zelenskyy into the state to benefit Ms Harris's presidential campaign.  Joe Biden held bilateral talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Thursday. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican who did not meet Mr Zelenskyy at the White House, demanded he fire his ambassador to Washington for planning the Scranton trip, called it a partisan campaign designed to shore up support for the Democrats in the battleground and clear \"election interference\". Trump has stood by his criticisms of Zelenskyy on the campaign trail.  He said on Monday the Ukrainian president wanted Ms Harris to win the election, and on Wednesday he called the Eastern European nation \"dead\" and \"demolished\".  After agreeing to meet with him, Trump repeated his claims that he could rapidly negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine if he defeats Ms Harris, blaming the Biden-Harris administration for allowing Russia's invasion. The newly announced US aid includes the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb called the Joint Standoff Weapon, with a range of up to 130 kilometres. The medium-range missile gives Ukraine a major upgrade to the weapons it is using to strike Russian forces, allowing the Ukrainians to do it at safer distances. Russian President Vladimir Putin outlines three key changes to the Kremlin's rules around the use of nuclear weapons for the first time since the decree was signed in 2020. The bomb, capable of striking targets with high accuracy, is to be dropped from fighter jets. It is not a long-range missile capable of hitting targets deep inside Russia, which Ukraine has been pleading the US to let it use for many months now. Washington has refrained from giving Ukraine this permission, fearing escalation of the war and direct hostility with Russia.  On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked the use of his nuclear weapons arsenal against any country allied with Ukraine, if long-range missiles struck Russian territory. The Kremlin made key changes to its nuclear doctrine, which spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned would be put into effect if Western nations \"participate in an attack on our country by various means, and not necessarily nuclear ones\".  Mr Biden's package will also provide Ukraine with additional Patriot air defences, unmanned aerial systems and air-to-ground munitions, as well as strengthen Ukraine's defence industrial base and support its maintenance and sustainment requirements. The bulk of the new aid — $US5.5 billion — is to be allocated before Monday's end of the US fiscal year, when the funding authority is set to expire. Another $US2.4 billion is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from US stocks. He ordered the Pentagon to expand training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year. \"We're making clear that we stand with Ukraine now and in the future,\" Mr Biden told reporters in the Oval Office. Mr Zelenskyy thanked Mr Biden for his support and said it was important to secure Ukraine's future in the European Union and NATO, a security alliance which has stopped short of endorsing Ukranian membership. Before visiting the White House, Mr Zelenskyy also sat down with dozens of Democratic and Republican politicians at the Capitol. \"It was bipartisan, it was positive,\" Republican Representative Joe Wilson, a leader of the House Ukraine caucus, told a reporter of the discussions. Russian plans to strike nuclear power plants threaten to cause a nuclear catastrophe that could reach beyond Ukraine's borders, Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns the UN, as Vladimir Putin issues a fresh threat to the West. US Congress has approved nearly $US175 billion of aid and military assistance for Ukraine and allied nations in the two-and-a-half years since Russia began its full-scale invasion, and many legislators say they expect Washington will need to approve more money to help Kyiv within the next several months. Mr Zelenskyy's visit was much lower-profile than previous trips to Congress. The Senate and House left Washington on Wednesday night until after the November 5 presidential election. Senator Dick Durbin described the victory plan he presented as \"pretty basic\". \"And that is to make sure that the Ukrainians have the momentum going forward, and that requires not only personnel, but equipment and supplies to finish the job,\" Mr Durbin told reporters. Ukraine's defence has largely received bipartisan support in the US. To combat Russian sanctions evasion and money laundering, Washington will act to disrupt what Mr Biden called \"a global cryptocurrency network, in coordination with international partners\". The US president said he would convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany next month to coordinate efforts of more than 50 countries supporting Ukraine.

(Reuters: Ricardo Arduengo ) In her first interview in more than two years, Melania Trump has blamed \"leaders from the opposition party and the mainstream media\" for the division that led to assassination attempts on her husband, former president Donald Trump. The former first lady sat down with Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt to promote her upcoming memoir, Melania, in an interview that aired in segments on the three-hour Fox and Friends program. Here are some key takeaways. Ms Trump has made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time. Aside from a handful of cameos – most notably when Trump announced his run at Mar-a-Lago in November 2022, a paid appearance at a campaign fundraiser in April, and the Republican National Convention in July – she has not taken a visible role in this campaign. Melania Trump chose not to speak at the Republican National Convention in July.  (Reuters: Mike Segar) She was also absent from the courtroom in which her husband faced 34 charges of falsifying business records in the hush money payments case. \"Where is Melania?\" has punctuated headlines and social media posts, leading to speculation about her relationship status with her husband and whether she approves of his bid for a second term as president. When asked how she feels about the campaign, Ms Trump told Earhardt, \"I support him.\" \"I know how passionate he is to make America great again.\" Ms Trump acknowledged another Trump presidency would come with \"strong tweets\" but would otherwise be \"great for this country\". \"I think American people need to decide what they really want. Maybe some, you know, strong tweets, but everything else great for this country.\" Earhardt had asked the former first lady about her reaction to Vice-President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, which led to a comparison of presidential records. \"The country is suffering; people are not able to buy usual necessities for their families. We have wars going on around the world, soldiers are dying, they were dying under this administration because of weak leadership. The border is open and dangerous, a lot of fentanyl is coming over and killing our youth. It is very hard to see. And our economy, it is really not great – inflation is high,\" she said. Two people, including suspected shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, were killed after an attempt on Donald Trump's life at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Look back at how the events unfolded. Ms Trump wasn't in Butler, Pennsylvania, the day her husband was shot in the ear but said she came close to seeing the attack live. Describing the moments before the attack, as described in her book, Earhardt noted a live stream of the rally had been playing on television. \"You started working and you were distracted, so you pushed pause,\" the Fox anchor said. \"I think your chief of staff, maybe, called you and said, 'He's okay but there's been a shooting.' What happened next?\" \"I ran to the TV and I rewound it and I watched it,\" Ms Trump replied.  \"I was only a few minutes behind.  \"Something, I guess, looked over me, so I didn't really see live live, but maybe three minutes, few minutes later. When I saw it, you know, nobody really knew yet, because when you see him on the floor, you don't know, you don't know what really happened.\" Ms Trump said she learned about the second assassination attempt against her husband, which happened this month, from television news reports. \"I think both of those events, they were really a miracle, if you really think about it,\" she said. Like her husband, Ms Trump says the media and Democrats are to blame for a divisive climate that led to assassination attempts on his life. The former president was shot in his right ear while speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 14. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) When asked why the Secret Service didn't do more to protect her husband, Ms Trump turned the focus in a different direction. \"Is it really shocking that all this outrageous violence goes against my husband? \"Especially that we hear the leaders from the opposition party and mainstream media branding him as a threat to democracy, calling him vile names, they're only fuelling a toxic atmosphere and giving power to all of these people who want to do harm to him. This needs to stop.\" With Ms Trump so rarely seen in the public eye, it's perhaps unsurprising that glimpses into the Trumps's home lives are also few and far between. But the former president is \"really a family man\", according to his wife. Earhardt asked Ms Trump what she wishes people knew about her husband. \"He loves his family, he loves this country and all he wants to build, build better and prosperous,\" she replied.

A US grand jury has reportedly indicted multiple Iranians on charges related to hacking Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.  According to a report by Politico, the federal charges stem from an Iranian operation that allegedly stole campaign communications. The defendants' names and specific criminal charges were not immediately available.  Without citing sources, Politico said a grand jury had secretly approved the indictment on Thursday afternoon, local time. The Department of Justice is expected to announce the charges as soon as Friday.  The department declined to comment.  Trump's campaign said in August that some of its internal communications had been hacked.  At the time, it blamed the Iranian government — a claim confirmed by the US intelligence community later that month. Trump, who is running for a second term in the White House, said on Wednesday that Iran may have been behind the recent assassination attempts against him.    He suggested if he were president and another country threatened a US presidential candidate, it risked being \"blown to smithereens\".  Iran responded by claiming accusations it had targeted former US officials were baseless.  Trump's campaign said the former president has been briefed on \"ongoing threats\" from Iran.  (Reuters: David Dee Delgado) The former president made his remarks after intelligence officials briefed him a day earlier on \"real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him,\" his campaign said.  \"Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months, and law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference,\" the statement read.  It comes as federal authorities continue to probe assassination attempts targeting Trump at one of his Florida golf courses in mid-September and at a Pennsylvania rally in July.  There has been no public suggestion by law enforcement agencies of involvement by Iran or any other foreign power in either incident.  Also on Thursday, Trump raised the idea of making a deal with Iran aimed at ending hostilities if he is elected president on November 5. \"I would do that,\" Trump said, but offered no details on the sort of detail he was discussing.  ABC/Reuters Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Security Intelligence US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Trump said if he won the election he would immediately begin working toward a resolution of the Ukraine conflict, despite his past flippant views. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented his war \"victory plan\" to Donald Trump during a closed-door meeting, after the Republican presidential candidate said he would work with both Ukraine and Russia to end their conflict. The meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Friday was the pair's first in-person encounter since 2019.  Mr Zelenskyy said he was talking with both Trump and his Democratic rival in the November 5 election, Vice-President Kamala Harris, because Ukraine needed strong US support in its continuing war with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House after addressing the UN General Assembly this week. Trump praised Mr Zelenskyy, but said he also had a solid relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We have a very good relationship (with Mr Zelenskyy), and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin,\" Trump told reporters.  \"And I think if we win, I think we're going to get it [the war] resolved very quickly,\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy has used his US visit to promote his victory plan, which a US official described as a repackaged request for more weapons and a lifting of restrictions on the use of long-range missiles. The plan presupposes the ultimate defeat of Russia in the war, the official said. Some officials see the aim as unrealistic. The pair met at Trump Tower in New York a day after the Ukrainian president's White House visit. (Reuters: Shannon Stapleton) When asked on Thursday by a reporter if Ukraine should hand over some of the Ukrainian land Russia has captured to end the war — a non-starter for Kyiv — Trump replied: \"We'll see what happens.\" At one point during a pre-meeting press conference on Friday, when Mr Zelenskyy suggested he had a better relationship with Trump than Putin did, Trump responded: \"Yeah, but you know it takes two to tango.\" Still, Trump said on Friday he was pleased to meet with Mr Zelenskyy, a marked change in tone from some of his previous comments on the campaign trail. After the meeting, Mr Zelenskyy called his talks with Trump \"very productive\". On Monday, Trump said Mr Zelenskyy wanted Ms Harris to win the election. He has also called Mr Zelenskyy \"the greatest salesman of all time\" because his country has received billions of dollars in military aid from the United States and Europe. \"It's an honour to have the president with us, and he's been through a lot,\" Trump said on Friday. \"He's been through a tremendous amount, like probably nobody else, almost nobody else in history, if you really get right down to it, and we're going to have a discussion and see what we could come up with.\" Trump on Friday said that if he won the election he would immediately begin working toward a resolution of the Ukraine conflict, even though he would formally take office only in late January 2025. Mr Zelenskyy, who was in the United States for the UN General Assembly, met on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Ms Harris at the White House. Over the weekend, he travelled to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with that state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, a Harris ally. The visit upset Trump's campaign and enraged some congressional Republicans who viewed the trip as a campaign stop, particularly as Pennsylvania is an important battleground state expected to decide the US election. Kamala Harris pledged her full support to Ukraine on Thursday, as the Democrats committed more than $US8 billion in funding. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) As late as Thursday, people close to Trump and his campaign had said a meeting appeared extremely unlikely, though the former president apparently changed his mind during Mr Zelenskyy's stay in the country. Trump and Ms Harris's differences on Ukraine echo splits in their respective Democratic and Republican parties, and their view of the US role in the world. Along with Trump, some Republicans in Congress have questioned the value of US funding and additional weapons for Ukraine's two-year battle against Russia's invasion, calling it futile, while Democrats led by Mr Biden have pushed to punish Russia and bolster Ukraine, framing Ukraine's victory as a vital national security interest. The war in Ukraine and foreign policy is in general lag behind domestic issues like the economy, healthcare and immigration in terms of what most voters think are important. But 64 per cent of registered voters say they support Ukraine's use of US-supplied arms to strike within Russia, according to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll, including 78 per cent of Democrats and 56 per cent of Republicans.

(Reuters) The men who want to be America's vice-president are preparing for their first, and probably only, televised campaign debate. It's another important moment in the US election race, which polls suggest is still an incredibly close contest. Tim Walz and JD Vance are both relatively low-profile politicians who haven't spent much time on the national stage – so a lot of voters don't know too much about them.  The debate is being hosted by CBS News at the network's broadcast centre in New York City. LIVE UPDATES: Get a ringside seat with our blog as Tim Walz and JD Vance go head-to-head The debate will start at 9pm Tuesday, local time, which is 11am Wednesday, AEST. In Australia, you can watch the debate on the ABC News Channel.  We'll also be live blogging the debate here on the ABC News website. American host broadcaster CBS will also stream the debate on its website and YouTube channel.  On the Democrats side, Kamala Harris's running mate is Tim Walz, a former high school teacher and American football coach.  Walz, 60, was first elected to the national Congress in 2006, representing a rural district in Minnesota. He quit Congress in 2019 to become the state's governor.  For the Republicans, Donald Trump's vice-presidential nominee is JD Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy, a best-selling memoir about life in poverty-stricken rural Ohio.  Vance, 40, was elected to the US Senate in 2022, after serving in the US Marine Corps and working as a venture capitalist. The rules, agreed to by both campaigns, are similar to the previous presidential debates. The debate will run for 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks of 4 minutes. CBS journalists Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan will ask the questions and moderate the debate. After being asked a question, the candidate will get 2 minutes to answer, and their opponent will then get 2 minutes to respond. Each candidate will then get a minute for further rebuttals. At the moderators' discretion, the candidates may get an extra minute each to continue the discussion. Candidates will not be told questions or topics in advance. There will be no audience. No props are allowed. No pre-written notes are allowed, but candidates will be given a pen and paper. Something that proved controversial in the previous presidential debates was the decision to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. In this debate, CBS says it \"reserves the right\" to mute microphones, but they could remain hot throughout. So there could be more back-and-forth discussion, or messy interjection, in this debate than the presidential ones. Why outrageous claims like 'eating cats and dogs' might lose a debate, but not an election Both Walz and Vance were chosen to be VP candidates, at least in part, to appeal to certain voting demographics.  Both men have talked up their backstories of rising from humble beginnings, and leaned into \"Midwest dad\" personas.  Their respective campaigns hope they will resonate in middle America, far from Harris's progressive home state of California and Trump's worlds of Manhattan real estate and Florida luxury resort life. The historic debate between the two US presidential hopefuls was full of jabs and incoherent speech. But each will paint the other as extremist. Vance has called Walz \"one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States government at any level\". Walz is known for critiquing Vance and Trump as \"weird\" and \"creepy as hell\". Both Vance and Walz have served in the military, but neither in combat.  Vance served four years in the US Marine Corps, which included about six months in Iraq in 2005 as a military journalist. Walz served 24 years in the National Guard — part of the US Army reserve — but he retired in May 2005. This was three months after he'd applied to run for Congress, and two months after his artillery unit was told it might be deployed to Iraq. This has become one of the things Vance most commonly attacks Walz on. He has described Walz's decision to retire just before possible deployment as \"shameful\".  He's also criticised Walz over a 2018 video, which was shared by the Harris campaign, showing Walz saying he'd carried weapons \"in war\".  The Harris campaign later said Walz \"misspoke\" when he said he carried weapons in war. Vance has accused Walz of \"stolen valour\". A key plank of the Democratic Party strategy has been linking Trump and Vance to the controversial Project 2025. Put together by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the \"presidential transition project\" contains contentious policies like banning abortion, eliminating climate change programs and disbanding the Department of Education. It also proposes stacking the civil service with loyalists and expanding the president's power. While some of Trump's allies and former staff helped write the plan, Trump has insisted he has \"nothing to do with it\". But Vance is close with the Heritage Foundation's president, Kevin Roberts, and even wrote the foreword for his upcoming book, noting that \"in the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon\". The most talked about moment from the most recent debate, between Trump and Harris, was Trump's claim that Haitian migrants were \"eating the pets\" in the town of Springfield, Ohio.  City and state officials, including Ohio's Republican governor, maintain there's no evidence of this. Shortly after the debate, Vance conceded it may be untrue — but he defended the claim anyway, even encouraging social media users to share pet memes. Vance told CNN he'd been \"trying to talk about the problems in Springfield for months\", and \"if I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do\". It's not the only pet-related claim that Vance has been forced to defend. His 2021 comments about the Democratic Party being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" attracted a tonne of backlash, including from Taylor Swift, who embraced the label when she endorsed the Harris-Walz ticked after the last debate. Vance has argued he was being sarcastic, and was trying to make a point about the Democratic Party being \"anti-family and anti-child\". Vance regularly attacks Walz over his record in Minnesota, including how he handled riots in its largest city, Minneapolis. The riots, after George Floyd's murder in 2020, caused $US500 million ($723 million) in property damage. After Joe Biden saw his 2024 ambitions evaporate, Kamala Harris went into a debate determined to ruffle Donald Trump's feathers. Critics say Walz should have activated the National Guard sooner. Vance said Walz \"allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis\".  Trump, who was then president, praised Walz at the time. Recording from a phone call shows Trump told a group of governors: \"I fully agree with the way he [Walz] handled it the last couple of days.\" Trump's campaign says Trump only praised the governor after he called in the National Guard. During the two presidential debates, we saw two different approaches to fact-checking the candidates.  In the first, between Trump and President Joe Biden, CNN's moderators did not fact-check the candidates in real-time. But the network's official fact-checkers later found Trump made 30 false claims – far more than Biden. In the second debate, between Trump and Harris, ABC's moderators did fact-check live. Trump, and many of his supporters, accused the moderators of bias because they pulled him up multiple times and did not catch out Harris.  CBS says its moderators will not fact-check live – but a QR code on the CBS broadcast will direct viewers to an online fact-checking service.

(Reuters: Brian Snyder) The US election on November 5 is expected to be very tightly contested. The Democrats are looking to overseas voters as a possible pathway to victory. The VP debate takes place on Wednesday and the election is on November 5. When America votes on November 5 the presidential battle between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is expected to go down to the wire. At present several polls have Ms Harris, the current Democrat vice-president, slightly ahead of Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House. With Trump a polarising figure in both the US and abroad, Democrats are looking to do everything they can to keep him from returning to power. And that includes here in Australia. There are at least 110,000 Americans living in Australia who are eligible to vote. And while voting is not compulsory in the US, statistics from the Federal Assistance Voting Program shows only 8.5 per cent of eligible Americans in Australia voted in the 2020 US election. American expats face a slew of problems when trying to vote in elections from abroad. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard) For the first time in US history, the Democratic party have made an investment in its Democrats Abroad group, spending almost half-a-million US dollars in the hope they can harness global votes in battleground states. San Francisco-native Amy Saha has lived in Australia for 17 years and is part of that movement as she looks to support Ms Harris. \"I need to do everything I possibly can to make sure he doesn't win,\" Ms Saha told 7.30. She has been campaigning on the streets of Sydney since October 2023, in a bid to entice fellow Americans based here to vote. Democrats Abroad are busy handing out 'how to vote' buttons to American expats in Australia. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard) Every Monday and Thursday, Ms Saha along with a group of volunteers from Democrats Abroad Australia ring eligible American voters, teaching them how to register and then encouraging them to vote wisely. They have also been handing out free buttons with voting information as well as committing to \"power hours\" each week. \"Every phone call costs us, so we're very careful about who we call, but yeah, we will stay on the phone with you if you're from Pennsylvania,\" she said. LIVE UPDATES: Get a ringside seat with our blog as Tim Walz and JD Vance go head-to-head Pennsylvania is a key battleground state which has flipped in the last four presidential elections, including for President Joe Biden who turned the state blue in 2020 with a margin of 81,660 votes. In 2016, Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes over Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama managed to win over Pennsylvania comfortably in 2012, succeeding over Republican Mitt Romney by 287,865 votes. In 2024 there are seven key swing states where every vote counts – Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, and Wisconsin. However, voting from overseas is not easy for Americans. \"Depending on which state you come from, it's not always that easy to vote remotely or absentee for Americans,\" Visiting Fellow at the US Studies Centre Ben Reilly said. Ben Reilly from the US Studies Centre. (ABC News: Richard Berrill) \"Some states make it extremely difficult.  \"You have to have an appointment at a local county, or you have to fax a document. Who uses faxes anymore? \"So despite the fact that the federal law insists that all eligible American voters should be able to vote when they're overseas, in practice, a lot depends on which state they're based in.\" Ms Saha has been trying to make this process easier for American voters in Australia by attending fourth of July events and debate watch parties and speaking to people face-to-face. Amy Saha is determined to help make sure Kamala Harris becomes the next US president. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard) \"I want five people who are lost and confused and think it's too much effort to register to vote,\" Ms Saha said of who she would be targeting. \"I want five never Republicans to realise they're not a homeless Republican. They're now a Democrat.\" The latest poll conducted by The New York Times and company FiveThirtyEight on September 30 shows Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by just 1 per cent in Pennsylvania. Michael Fullilove is the executive director of The Lowy Institute. He revealed new data to 7.30 that shows a drop off in support for Trump among Australians since Ms Harris replaced Mr Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate. Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute. (ABC News: Michael Nudl) \"Mr Trump was extremely unpopular in 2016, when the Trump phenomenon was much newer to Australians,\" Mr Fullilove said. \"His support was around 11 per cent and it increased to a high of about 29 per cent when Mr Biden was still in the race.\" In a September survey of 2,028 people the The Lowy Institute found the number of Australians who prefer Ms Harris has risen. Support for her is at 73 per cent, which is up from the 68 per cent in March who supported Mr Biden, while support for Trump has dropped in that time from 29 to 22 per cent. Greg Swenson is the chairman of Republicans Overseas UK and says he's unsure of who exactly runs the group's branch in Australia. But support for Trump does exist. Twitter boss Elon Musk and UFC head Dana White are amongst his big supporters in the United States and Mr Swenson pointed to actor Holly Valance as an Australian connection. Holly Valance and husband Nick Candy attend Britain's Reform UK party's national conference in Birmingham. (Reuters: Hollie Adams) \"The fundraiser we had in June for Trump, that was actually at Holly Valance's home with Nick Candy, so we have real connectivity with Australia,\" Mr Swenson said. But finding vocal Republicans who are willing to support him publicly in Australia has been difficult. While the Democrats have spent millions to try and garner overseas votes, the Republican party didn't make the same commitment and Mr Swenson believes Kamala Harris has a serious advantage because of it. \"I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats have a much bigger chunk of the electorate overseas, not just in Australia or the UK, but just in general. I think the exceptions will be countries with large military presence,\" he told 7.30. With just over one month until the US election Ms Saha had a message for undecided US voters. \"It's our civic duty to just represent our voice,\" she said. \"Obviously, I support Harris-Walz, but I think it's just important that people make sure that if [people] have an opinion, they express it.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Analysis by Nick Bryant Melbourne US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Mr Routh will remain in custody pending trial. The man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump on September 15 has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges. Ryan Routh is alleged to have positioned himself with a rifle outside one of the former president's Florida golf courses. Mr Routh, 58, entered the plea to charges that include attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate during a hearing before US Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart. He has already been ordered to remain in jail pending trial. Mr Routh appeared for the hearing handcuffed and wearing a tan prison jumpsuit. He answered, \"Yes, your honour,\" when asked by Judge Reinhart if he understood the charges against him. Mr Routh's defence lawyer then entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. The man accused of hiding out with a gun near Donald Trump's Florida golf course in an apparent bid to kill the former president wrote a letter months earlier describing an \"assassination attempt\", prosecutors say. Prosecutors have said he intended to kill Trump as he golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Mr Routh, a struggling roofing contractor, condemned the Republican presidential candidate in a self-published book and wrote a letter months earlier referencing an attempted assassination on Trump, according to prosecutors. \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,\" the suspect wrote, according to a court filing by prosecutors. Lawyers for Mr Routh suggested at an earlier court hearing that the letter may have been an attempt by their client to gain publicity and highlighted what they called his efforts to promote democracy in Ukraine and Taiwan. Mr Routh hid outside a fence overlooking the sixth hole of the golf course, where authorities found an AK-47-style rifle, a bag of snacks, a digital camera and bags containing metal plates meant to withstand return fire by the US Secret Service, according to prosecutors. Ryan Routh pictured here in a jail booking photograph from 2010.  (Supplied: Guilford County Sheriff's Office) A Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump spotted Mr Routh and opened fire after noticing the rifle sticking through a fence. He fled and was later arrested along a Florida highway, prosecutors said. Mr Routh was initially charged with gun-related offences. An indictment last week added the attempted assassination charge, along with assault on a federal officer and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. The Florida incident was the second apparent assassination attempt on Trump in a roughly two-month span, raising questions about protection of the candidate ahead of the November 5 election. A gunman wounded Trump's right ear and killed an attendee at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 before being killed by a Secret Service sniper. Trump has sought to turn the assassination attempts into a campaign issue, alleging that the Department of Justice, which charged Trump in two criminal cases last year, should not be trusted to handle the investigation.

But the debate between Republican VP nominee JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz was, if nothing else, eagerly anticipated. In an election that has so far featured two assassination attempts, a reshuffle of the Democratic ticket, and achingly close polling, the stakes of the running mate face-off felt higher than usual.  During the 90-minute debate broadcast from New York City, the contrast between Walz and Vance in style, personality and political philosophy was on full display. While Vance, a 40-year-old Ohio senator, has only been in politics for 18 months, he is an experienced live performer thanks to his repeated appearance on Fox News.  Polls show he is also deeply unpopular with many Americans. Walz, Minnesota's Democratic Governor, has had a longer political career, but is known for being a folksy, off-the-cuff communicator. He is more popular with voters than Vance, thanks in part to efforts by Democratic strategists to cast him as the internet's favourite dad. From big questions about the future of the Middle East to the fate of the US economy, these were the key moments from the vice-presidential debate. The first question of the debate was about the Middle East. Earlier on Wednesday, Iran fired about 200 missiles at Israel in response to the killings of senior leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The missile strikes on Israel is the latest in a series of escalations in the Middle East and, unlike Iran's last retaliation, could see the situation devolve further in a region on the brink. The candidates were asked if they would support a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Walz, who appeared a little nervous in the first moments of the debate, used his answer to criticise Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying that \"steady leadership\" is fundamental during a time of global upheaval. \"The world saw on the debate stage a few weeks ago a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes and it is not what we need at the moment,\" he said. \"It is not just that — those closer to Donald Trump understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. His chief of staff John Kelly said he was the most flawed human being he had ever met.\"  Vance, meanwhile, appeared more polished in his first answer, taking a moment to thank viewers for \"caring enough about this country\" to tune into the debate. He then said it would be up to Israel to do what they need to do to keep their country safe. \"We should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys,\" he said. A few months ago, Vance and Walz were not well known political figures. But since being catapulted onto the national stage, journalists have been digging into their past comments, which made for some awkward moments during the debate. JD Vance (left) and Tim Walz shook hands when they met for the first time on the debate stage.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid ) The moderators asked Walz to explain why he previously claimed to be in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989, when records show he didn't arrive in the region until August of that year. Walz said he misspoke. \"I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart out to my community and tried to be the best I can and I have not always been perfect,\" he said. \"I am a knucklehead at times.\" The moderators then asked Vance to explain why he is Trump's running mate when he described him as \"America's Hitler\" in 2016. \"I have been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump,\" he said. \"When you screw up and speak, and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people.\" Hurricane Helene has caused widespread flooding and damage in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. Hurricane Helene's death toll has surpassed 150 as rescuers search for survivors across several southern US states.  (Reuters: Marco Bello) The death toll currently stands at 150, and may rise. When asked what responsibility a Trump administration would have to reduce the impact of climate change, Vance said the hurricane is an \"unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy\". \"Climate change is a very important issue. People are worried about crazy weather patterns but it is important for us to firstly say, Donald Trump and I support clean air and clean water,\" he said. Walz noted that Trump previously described climate change as a \"hoax\". He said that farmers in his home state of Minnesota \"know climate change is real\", and are experiencing \"back to back\" droughts and floods. \"The solution for us is to continue to move forward, [to acknowledge] that climate change is real,\" he said. \"Reducing our impact is absolutely critical but this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you're creating jobs as we are seeing all across the country.\" The debate got tense when the moderators brought up abortion access. In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Americans' constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, and sent the issue back to the states to decide. Polls suggest this is pushing more women to consider voting for Democratic candidates over the Republican party. In the first electoral test of Americans' mood since the US Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade, a traditionally conservative state votes to protect abortion rights. It could be a sign of what's to come.  Vance has caused controversy with his anti-abortion statements in the past — in 2022, he said he \"'would like abortion to be illegal nationally.\" On the debate stage, Vance denied ever backing a national abortion ban, and said he and Trump want to be \"pro-family in the fullest sense of the word\". \"We've got to do so much better a job at earning Americans' trust back,\" he said. Walz said that the Republican party wants to make it more difficult for Americans to get contraception and limit access to infertility treatment. \"We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,\" he said. \"This is a basic human right.\" Despite the threat of war and natural disasters, the US election will likely be decided on economic issues. The US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates for the first time since the pandemic, and with the race for the White House in full swing both sides of politics move to push their narratives around what it means for the economy. Inflation and cost of living remains the top concern for voters, according to most US polls. Trump long held an advantage among polled US voters, who said they trusted his ability to handle economic issues over Democrats. But the gap between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is starting to narrow, according to recent polls. That might be due to easing inflation and the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, or it might be that voters are getting to know Harris better. Walz was asked about Harris's campaign pledge to give $US25,000 ($36,000) payments to first-time homebuyers and build 3 million new homes to help ease the pressure. \"We need to make it more affordable,\" he said. \"People with stable housing end up with stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to get to school. All of those things in the long run, end up saving our money.\" In response, Vance said that \"unused\" federal land should be used for new housing. \"We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here,\" the Republican said. The debate ended with a rather tense back-and-forth about Trump's refusal to accept that he lost the 2020 election. Vance repeatedly declined to answer a question from Walz about whether Trump lost four years ago, instead trying to shift the conversation back to censorship.  \"That is a damning non-answer,\" Walz said.  \"When this is over, we need to shake hands this election, and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It’s tearing our country apart.\"  Historically, vice-presidential debates don't have much impact on the outcome of US elections.  (Reuters: Caitlin Ochs) Vance did say he would concede the election if he loses on November 5.  \"If Tim Walz is the next vice-president, he will have my prayers and best wishes and my help whenever he wants it,\" he said.  The debate then ended with candidates shaking hands and introducing each other to their wives — a much more conciliatory mood than the debate between Harris and Trump last month.  Aggregates of national polls suggest this race is in a dead heat. Nate Cohn, the New York Times' polling expert, says if polls are correct, \"it would be the closest modern US presidential election\". Could the vice-presidential debate shift the needle on election day on November 5?  Stranger things have happened in 2024.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Leigh Sales Topic:US Elections Analysis by Jade Macmillan US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

The head-to-head in New York City saw the candidates clash over topics including abortion and gun violence. But there was little of the personal enmity that characterised earlier debates featuring Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Look back on how the debate unfolded below. By Caitlin Rawling It is past midnight in New York City, where the debate was held, so we will wrap up our live coverage here. You can scroll back through the blog to go over how it all unfolded. Here are some of the big moments from the debate: Tim Walz's closing statement is available here and JD Vance's closing statement is here. And if you're just wanting a quick recap, my colleague Rebecca Armitage has put together the key moments from the vice-presidential debate: By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Another Gen Z voter I’ve touched base with after the debate is Gavin Griffin - a 20-year-old registered Democrat from Titusville, Pennsylvania. He tuned in from a watch party at the Crawford County Pennsylvania Democratic Headquarters in the north-west corner of the critical swing state. He said the difference between the two candidates was clear. \"JD Vance talks big on working folks and rural America, but Tim Walz has actually delivered.  \"He talked with sincerity about the issues that most impact working Americans, because he’s lived that reality firsthand. “Governor Walz — several times — corrected Vance and explained the truth for the millions watching across the country. \"He showed himself to be a no-nonsense candidate, demonstrating that truth still matters on American politics.\" Overall, Gavin said he found it refreshing to see a civil discussion on policy play out between the two politicians, proving that common courtesy is possible even when candidates disagree. By Elissa Steedman  In contrast to the stream of posts from the Trumps, the President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have shared few words. Save for one donations call-out, Harris' X account has mostly been retweeting debate highlights shared to Walz's page.  Biden's post, which also shared a donation link, said tonight's debate made it clear Walz \"has what it takes\". \"Trust me, I know what a good vice-president looks like,\" he wrote. #WinningWithWalz is now trending on X with more than 62,500 posts. By Elissa Steedman Both Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr were active on social media throughout the debate. You'll win no points for guessing how they think JD Vance performed. The former president has posted to Truth Social more than 55 times since the debate first started, just over three hours ago. \"JD crushed it! Walz was a Low IQ Disaster - Very much like Kamala,\" he wrote in one post. \"Our Country would never be able to recover from an Administration of these two. Can you imagine them representing us with sharp, fierce Foreign Leaders? I can't!\" His eldest son also spoke positively about Vance but had a few barbs for his opponent, Tim Walz. \"Wait, is JD Vance debating Tim Walz or a Joe Biden stand in?\" he wrote in one Tweet. Both Trump and Trump Jr also accused the moderators of bias against Vance. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania The CBS moderators mostly kept the fact-checking to a minimum, but the network had a team of fact-checkers posting online during the debate. So far, they've determined three of JD Vance's claims were outright false: They also found Tim Walz falsely claimed Trump hadn't paid taxes in 15 years. According to a congressional committee report, Trump paid $US641,931 in federal income tax in 2015, $US750 in both 2016 and 2017; and $US133,445 in 2019. However, a 2020 New York Times investigation found there were at least 10 years in which Trump did not pay income tax at all. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania The ABC's national political lead, David Speers, has given his post-debate analysis on the ABC News Channel. By Elissa Steedman No matter which way you slice it, debating works up an appetite. While JD Vance debriefed on Fox, Tim Walz opted to skip the spin room altogether. He was spotted at Justino's, a pizza joint across the street from the CBS Studios in New York.  While there were only a handful of people in the shop, supporters outside reportedly yelled \"Coach!\" as he left. He stopped for a photo with a person outside.  By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania JD Vance has been speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity. He said he wanted to use the debate to \"remind the American people that Donald Trump is not the caricature that Kamala Harris and the media have made him out to be\".  Rather, he said, he was \"an incredibly effective president\" who \"actually solved problems\". The world was more peaceful under Trump, Vance said, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East made it easier to prove that point.  Vance said he was nervous going into the debate.  \"I do a lot of these interviews, Sean, but I was nervous. It's the biggest stage of my life.  \"So I didn't focus so much on his demeanour. I just tried to focus on what he was saying. \"And look, to be fair to Tim Walz, he had a very tough job, and that is to defend the policies of Kamala Harris.\" By Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC I’ve touched base with some Gen Z voters on both sides of the political aisle from the critical swing state of Pennsylvania to gauge what they made of the past 90 minutes.  One of them is 25-year-old registered Republican Nathan Kristoff, who watched the debate from a YouTube livestream in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.  He said while the debate between the two VP nominees was a close one, he believes JD Vance won overall.  For Nathan, the biggest stand out moments were the discussions the pair had on illegal immigration in the United States.  “The communities close to me in south-western Pennsylvania have began seeing a real issue with this…it surprises me how much people don’t see this issue, and continue to walk around like it’s not happening. “The state of America is on a thin line right now. We experienced a time with Donald Trump as president, and things in the country were running smoothly.\" He said when Donald Trump was in office, he was “just getting started as an adult”.  \"People were living comfortably and things were affordable... Within the last four years it has become harder and harder as the days go on,” he said.  “If [Kamala] Harris wins, we as US citizens will continue to live terribly while non-citizens thrive off of our country.” By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke Democrats will be disappointed by that performance from their VP contender Tim Walz. He seemed nervous, he repeatedly stumbled over his words and his arguments were unsteady. He was less charming daggy dad and more bumbling uncle.  For a man vying to be \"one heartbeat away\" from the presidency, it was an unimpressive outing. He seemed rusty and perhaps the Democratic strategy which has seen both Walz and Kamala Harris mostly avoid hard interviews might have left him unprepared to debate JD Vance. He did improve as the debate went on.  Among his strongest moments came towards the end when he prosecuted the case on the January 6 attack on the US Capitol; painting Donald Trump as a threat to democracy and JD Vance as someone who wouldn't even admit Trump lost the last election. Vance by comparison seemed sharp and calm. He was also surprisingly amiable towards Walz, which might have shocked people who expected him to be a snarky and unlikeable guy. He was disciplined, deftly pulling the debate constantly back to some of the stronger points for Republicans, like immigration, and tying Kamala Harris to Joe Biden's unpopular presidency. Vice-presidential debates are not usually major factors in US elections and it's unlikely anything said tonight will make a huge difference in this race. Walz will be embarrassed by his performance but he hasn't fatally wounded his ticket. There will be greater pressure for both Walz and Harris to answer more tough questions, though, to see if they deserve the White House. By Elissa Steedman \"I want to thank Governor Walz, you folks at CBS and of course, the American people for tuning in this evening. \"And one of the issues we didn't talk about was energy. \"I remember when I was being raised by my grandmother and when she did not have enough money to turn on the heat at night, because Ohio gets cold at night and because money was often tight. \"I believe, as a person who wants to be your next vice-president, that we are a rich and prosperous enough country where every American, whether they're rich or poor, ought to be able to turn on their heat in the middle of a cold winter night. That's got more difficult thanks to Kamala Harris's energy policies. \"I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to afford a nice meal for your family. That's gotten harder because of Kamala Harris's policies. \"I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to buy a house, you ought to be able to live in safe neighbourhoods, you ought to not have your communities flooded with fentanyl and that, too, has gotten harder because of Kamala Harris' policies. \"Now, I have been in politics long enough to do what Kamala Harris does when she stands before the American people and says that on day one, she's going to work on all these challenges I just listed. \"She's been the vice-president for three-and-a-half years. Day one was 1,400 days ago and her policies have made these problems worse. \"Now, I believe we have the most beautiful country in the world. I meet people on the campaign trail who cannot afford food but have the grace and generosity to ask me how I'm doing and to tell me they're praying for my family. \"What that has taught me is we have the greatest country, the most beautiful country, the most incredible people anywhere in the world. But they're not going to be able to achieve their full dreams with the broken leadership we have here in Washington. They're not going to be able to live their American Dream if we do the same thing we've been doing the last three-and-a-half years. \"We need change, we need a new direction, we need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump. \"And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say, I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you. God bless ya and good night.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania \"Thank you Senator Vance, thank you to CBS News, and most importantly, thank you to all of you, if you are still up, and the folks who have missed Dancing With The Stars, I appreciate it. \"But look. The support of the democracy matters. It matters that you're here. \"And I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built. From Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between there. \"And they don't all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people. They believe in a positive future of this country, and one where politics can be better than it is. \"And I have to tell you, that 'better than it is' is that sense of optimism that there can be an opportunity economy that works for everyone, not just to get by, but to get ahead. \"And the idea that freedom really means something. Not the freedom of government to be in your bedroom or exam room, but the freedom for you to make choices about yourself. \"Look, we all know who Donald Trump is. He has told us, and as Maya Angelou said, believe him when he told you that. \"His first inaugural address talked about American carnage, and then he spent four years trying to maybe do that. \"Senator Vance tonight made it clear he will stand with Donald Trump's agenda. He will continue to push down that road. \"Kamala Harris gives us a different option. Now I have to tell you, I am going to be careful about the quotes, but there is one that Senator Vance said that does resonate with me. He said, 'Donald Trump makes the people I care about afraid'. A lot of America feels that way. \"We don't need to be afraid. Franklin Roosevelt was right. All we have to fear is fear itself. \"Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward. She is bringing us a politics of joy, she is bringing real solutions for the middle-class and she is centring you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement, make your voices heard, let's look for a new day where everybody gets that opportunity and everybody gets a chance to thrive. \"I humbly ask for your vote on November 5th for Kamala Harris.\" By Elissa Steedman With the closing statements now finished, CBS has called time on the campaign trail's only vice-presidential debate. JD Vance and Tim Walz have been joined on stage by their partners and are lingering on stage in conversation. The candidates are seen shaking their rivals' wives' hands. By Elissa Steedman The second commercial break has just finished and the candidates are giving their closing statements. Tim Walz is up first after JD Vance earlier won a coin toss and chose to speak last. We'll post their statements in full shortly. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Responding to JD Vance's comments about democracy, Tim Walz talks about Donald Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election result, and the January 6 insurrection on the US Capitol. \"140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day,\" Walz says. \"Some with the American flag, several later died.\" He says protesters also gathered on the state Capitol grounds in the state he governs. \"In Minnesota, a group gathered on the state Capitol grounds in Saint Paul and said 'we are marching to the governor's residence and there may be casualties'. \"The only person there was my son and his dog, who was rushed out crying by state police.\" By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Moderator Norah O'Donnell says the \"state of democracy\" is the top issue for American voters, after the economy and inflation. JD Vance has previously said he would not have certified the  2020 election result, and he's asked if he'd challenge this year's election result too. \"I believe we actually have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately it is not the threat Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about,\" Vance says. \"It is the threat of censorship. \"It is Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. \"It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens. \"And it is Kamala Harris saying that, rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor the people who engage in misinformation. \"I think that is a much bigger threat than anything we have seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years.\" By Elissa Steedman Tim Walz has previously said paid parental leave would be a day one priority if he is elected. He's now been asked by Margaret Brennan how long employers would be required to pay for workers to take leave to care for their newborns. \"Well, that's negotiable,\" Walz says. \"And that's how Congress works.\" \"A federal program of paid family leave will enhance the workforce, enhance the families and make it easier to have the children that you want.\" When asked whether he supports paid parental leave, JD Vance says he thinks a bipartisan solution would be possible.   \"The cultural pressure on young families and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model that they want,\" he says. \"A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately; some would like to take time home with the kids; some would like longer at home with the kids. \"We should have a family care model that makes choice possible.\" By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke Going into this debate, the expectation was JD Vance would aggressively attack Tim Walz, given he's constantly skewered both Walz and Vice-President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail. But while Vance has gone on the attack on occasion it's been relatively gentle. Perhaps because he feels like he's winning? By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania In the previous presidential debate, Donald Trump was asked about his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which is designed to help lower-class Americans access health insurance. Asked if he had a plan to improve it, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\". \"A lot of people have criticised this 'concepts of a plan' remark,\" JD Vance concedes. \"I think it's very simple common sense. As Tim Walz knows from 12 years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900-page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears, and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give-and-take of bipartisan negotiation.\" He says Trump, as president, worked \"in a bipartisan way\" to ensure Americans had access to affordable healthcare, and he has now \"earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies\". Tim Walz says it cracked him up when Trump spoke about concepts of a plan. \"As a fourth-grade teacher ... my kids would have never given me that,\" he says. By Elissa Steedman We're now launching into housing policy. The moderators have asked both candidates for more detail on their campaigns' plans, including where they would build new housing.  The Harris campaign has promised a $US22,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers and a $US10,000 tax credit, promising to build 3 million new homes. \"The problem we have had is that we have a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity,\" Tim Walz says. \"The program the vice-president [Kamala Harris] is pushing forward and bringing in is a new way of approaching this.  It's something we're doing in Minnesota. \"We invested … and it starts to make it easier, cut some of the red tape.\" He says the plan would save money in the long run. The Trump campaign proposes to seize federal land to build homes, remove regulation, provide tax breaks and cut back on immigration. \"What would immediately change the equation? If you lower energy prices,\" JD Vance says.  \"As Donald Trump says, 'drill baby, drill'. \"Think about if a truck driver is paying 40 per cent more for diesel — owning a house will also become more expensive. \"If we open up American energy, you will get pricing relief immediately — not, by the way, just in housing, but in other economic goods.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) You'd be mistaken to write off the group of MAGA supporters gathered at a Michigan intersection urging motorists to \"Honk for Trump\" as a futile attempt to win votes for the former president. \"It's about reminding people that there's an election and reminding them that they can vote for Trump,\" says Mark Forton, the chairman of the Macomb County Republican Party. \"There's going to be tonnes of media in America against Trump, believe me, so we got to be out there best we can.\" Our roadside conversation is interrupted by a cacophony of noise – beeping, revving, and hollering from motorists. In the Honk for Trump poll, at least, the former president is winning. We're in Michigan, a key battleground state that Democrat Kamala Harris almost certainly has to win if she is going to become the next president of the United States. Mark Forton, the Republican Party chairman for Macomb County, campaigning for Donald Trump. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) In Michigan, Republicans are fighting to win votes both for Donald Trump and local candidates like Mike Rogers who is running for Senate. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) It’s part of a string of states that, from the ‘90s, have voted for Democrat Presidents – the so-called \"Blue Wall\". Yet in 2016, Michigan was one of three Blue Wall states that fell to Donald Trump. He won it by the slimmest margin of any state that year – 0.23 per cent.  Joe Biden won it back in 2020 and right now, polls in Michigan are neck and neck between Harris and Trump. Some Democrats are quick to dismiss Michigan Republicans' efforts to secure support ahead of this year's presidential election. But on the ground, it's clear the conservatives have a strategy, and it could cost Kamala Harris this crucial swing state. In American elections, voting isn't compulsory. Campaigns use two main approaches: firstly, mobilising their existing voter base who supported their party in the past to vote again, and secondly, persuading swing or undecided voters to join their side. People who routinely cast ballots for the other party aren't often prioritised, but that's not Mark Forton's strategy. He's knocking on doors regardless of the resident's recorded political position. Republicans have a solid base in Macomb county, but they need it to be bigger. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) \"We're going to everybody,\" he says. \"You don't know who's on the other side of the door and you don't know how they're suffering.\" A ground swell of support for Trump among the working class in Macomb in 2016 is often credited as being the reason he won the state by just 10,000 votes. Forton spent his life working in the car manufacturing industry. He's watched inflation and job losses impact households across Macomb in recent years. \"Maybe they just lost jobs because factories move?\" he says. \"We're going to focus on winning the Democrat vote because those people deserve a future too.\" In 2020, Macomb Republicans targeted suburbs that are traditionally home to unionised, Democrat-leaning residents. In that year, they won every county office position on the voting ballot bar one. \"We won everything except the sheriff's race in the county,\" explains Forton. \"This county is critical in Michigan and we've got to win big again.\" MAGA supporters are working to secure a second Trump presidency. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) Door knocking with Forton gives a glimpse into the ways Republicans are trying to win more votes. He visits homes with the Republican candidate for sheriff, Terence Mekoski. Forton views residents who say they don't wish to speak about the presidential election, or who are yet to decide, as guaranteed Republican votes. \"By November, they will vote for Trump,\" he says, \"Because they're not a left-wing radical that's buried in concrete. They're thinking.\" At the doors, topics discussed range from the immigration system to gun ownership, from COVID-19 restrictions to Trump's character. \"Would you want a young man with his exact moral fibre to step into your house and take your daughter out? I don't think so,\" one independent voter says. In multiple conversations, Forton and Mekoski deploy a persuasion tactic, explaining how they've been to Trump's resort at Mar-a-Lago several times in the past year. They say Trump is nothing like the way he's portrayed in the media. A groundswell of Trump support in Macomb County is often credited as the reason he won Michigan in 2016. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) \"I've had the opportunity to meet Donald Trump many times,\" says Mekoski, going on to describe Trump as \"respectful\" and \"pleasant\". \"I haven't met very many people that raise great kids and are rotten people,\" he adds. \"His children are second to none.\" Of the three undecided voters they speak to, one remains unconvinced, and two say they're leaning towards voting for Trump. To win Michigan, the Trump campaign is not relying on just winning the votes of the white working class. It’s targeting African Americans too. The Black community overwhelmingly votes Democratic. Polls show while most African American voters support Kamala Harris over Donald Trump for president, the Democrat candidate's popularity in the community is lower than Joe Biden's in 2020. Earlier this year, Trump urged Republican leaders in Michigan to increase their outreach to this key demographic.

(Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) Almost 80 per cent of Detroit’s population is African American, who largely vote Democratic. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) Two prominent African American figures are guest speakers – Trump's former housing and urban development secretary Dr Ben Carson and former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick was the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008 – and a Democrat – but this year he's supporting Donald Trump. His attendance has attracted the media, a coup for the Oakland County Republican Party and event organiser, chairman Vance Patrick. \"We need more people,\" explains Patrick. \"How do we get more people? By convincing Democrats to see a different path. Kwame is here just to bring that home to them.\" In Kilpatrick's speech, he explains why he's backing the former president. \"It's not about warm and touchy feelings, it's about how we come together as a nation and preserve our way of life,\" Kilpatrick says on stage. \"I want Trump in the room when Vladimir Putin shows up, I want Trump in the room if Xi from China walks into the room, I want Trump in the room when Kim Jong Un comes to play,\" he says to rapturous applause. Former Mayor of Detroit Kwame Kilpatrick was once a Democrat but is now backing Trump. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) But there is more to Kilpatrick's story than just being a Democrat who converted to the Republican cause.  In 2013, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for corruption crimes, including extortion and fraud. After serving seven years, he had his sentence commuted in 2021 by then-president Donald Trump. As a politician with a criminal history, Kilpatrick believes that Trump's own convictions have helped to garner support among African American voters. \"The inequity in prosecution and sentencing has been going on in America for a long time,\" Kilpatrick says. \"People in the community feel that somebody who has experienced it will be better prepared to meet it and try and change it.\" It's a sentiment that Trump has repeated himself. \"I think that's why the Black people are so much on my side now because they see what's happening to me, happens to them,\" he said in February. Republicans and Democrats are knocking on doors across Michigan to win votes. Locals at a White Castle fast food outlet in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) \"I got indicted a second time and a third time and a fourth time and a lot of people said that that's why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against.\" The message may be resonating, with a recent poll finding one in four young African American men in the US support the former president. Despite favour in some communities, Donald Trump's path to the White House via Michigan isn't clear cut. Kent County, in the state's west, illustrates the potential roadblocks. Kent County has historically produced some key Republican figures – former president Gerald Ford is from here – but in recent elections, more and more voters have been casting ballots for Democrats. In 2022, congresswoman Hillary Scholten became the first Democrat to win her western Michigan seat in almost 50 years. Traditionally Republican Kent County is West Michigan’s manufacturing heartland and has become a battleground area. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) \"I talk to people in my district every day who are still undecided about the race,\" she says. Congresswoman Scholten believes Kamala Harris needs to attract voters who have conservative values while also maintaining the Democrat's core base. \"I think we get so lost in this idea that Trump is going to be so much worse … and that should be enough [for people to vote Democratic]. We need to acknowledge the ways that we have not shown up for people,\" she says, citing the economy and inflation as the issues where Democrats are vulnerable. \"It doesn't resonate with people at the end of the day if they still can't afford their basic needs … I think there's no harm in acknowledging that.\" Amid the Democratic shift, Republicans are fighting hard to retain the support of Kent County voters. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, has held three rallies here during the campaign. More residents in traditionally Republican Kent County have been voting Democratic. (Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) Yet, dotted across the county are billboards that visually depict an issue for the party ahead of the election – conservative voters who have abandoned Donald Trump. \"I'm a former Trump voter. I love the Constitution. I'm voting for Harris\" reads one, with a picture of a smiling, middle-aged white man. Further down the highway is another with a different face, but the same message. Tom Moore is a former Trump voter who is now making the case against him, agreeing to be featured in the billboard campaign. \"The Republican Party has changed,\" he says. \"It doesn't reflect the values that I have.\" Moore is an army veteran and gun owner, but he's been alarmed by Trump's approach to foreign policy. \"If [Trump] gets to power, he'll pull the United States out of the world, isolate us, and that's not good for the world and it's not good for our economy,\" he says.

(Foreign Correspondent: Raveen Hunjan) The $US50 million billboard and ad campaign was arranged by the Republican Voters Against Trump group and is paid for by the Republican Accountability PAC. It's largely funded by anti-Trump mega-donors, including both conservatives and progressives. Moore voted for Trump in 2016, then didn't vote for either major candidate in 2020. This election he is voting for Kamala Harris. It's a decision that has put him at odds with the rest of his conservative community. \"I'm truly in exile,\" he says. \"I don't belong to the Republican Party anymore, but of course, I'm not really a Democrat.\" Moore admits he doesn't think his billboards will convert committed Trump voters, but hopes they'll encourage undecided voters to think twice.

Maybe it will make someone think a little bit.\" At the local diner where we met for lunch, the conversation turns to a rally that JD Vance is holding nearby the following day. \"I hope he sees one of my billboards,\" Moore says with a smile.

Trump intentionally lied to the public, election officials and his vice-president in his failed bid to cling to power, while privately describing election fraud claims as \"crazy\", prosecutors allege in the 165-page filing. The filing from special counsel Jack Smith's team offers the most comprehensive view to date of what prosecutors intend to prove if the case charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the election reaches trial. While Trump's efforts to undo the election have been chronicled in stark detail through a months-long congressional investigation, this filing cites previously unknown accounts by Trump's closest aides. \"The details don't matter,\" Trump said, when told by an adviser that a lawyer mounting his legal challenges wouldn't be able to prove the false allegations in court, the filing states. The brief has been made public despite objections by Trump's legal team. Trump is hoping to win a second term as US president in November. Here's what that would mean for the criminal cases against him.  It comes in the final month of a closely contested presidential race. Democrats have argued Trump is unfit for office, using his refusal to accept the election results four years ago to support their claim. The topic surfaced as recently as this week's vice-presidential debate. Tim Walz and JD Vance engaged in a minutes-long squabble over violence at the Capitol on January 6. Mr Vance refused to directly answer when asked whether his running mate had lost the 2020 race. The filing was initially submitted under seal in response to a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take while in office. The immunity decision narrowed the scope of the prosecution and eliminated the possibility of a trial before next month's election. Prosecutors hope to persuade District Judge Tanya Chutkan that Trump's actions were undertaken in a private capacity, rather than under his role as president. If they are successful, that would allow the charges to remain part of the case as it moves forward. Judge Chutkan permitted a redacted version to be made public, despite Trump's lawyers arguing it was unfair to unseal it so close to the election on November 5. It's uncertain whether the case will go to trial, particularly if Trump is elected president. \"Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,\" Mr Smith's team wrote. \"When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office.\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung argued the brief was \"falsehood-ridden\" and \"unconstitutional\". He repeated claims that Mr Smith and Democrats were \"hell-bent on weaponising the Department of Justice in an attempt to cling to power\". Republicans have repeatedly claimed special counsel Jack Smith is carrying out a \"witch hunt\" against Trump.  (AP: J Scott Applewhite) In a post to Truth Social, Trump said the case would end with his \"complete victory\". The filing alleges Trump \"laid the groundwork\" for rejecting the election results before the contest was over. He allegedly told advisers in the event he held an early lead, he would \"declare victory before the ballots were counted and any winner was projected\". Prosecutors say immediately after the election, his advisers sought to sow chaos in the counting of votes. In one instance, a campaign employee, who is also described as a Trump co-conspirator, was told results favouring Joe Biden at a Michigan polling centre appeared accurate. The person is alleged to have replied, \"find a reason it isn't\" and \"give me options to file litigation\". Prosecutors also allege Trump advanced claims of fraud despite knowing they were false. They describe how he told others that allegations of election irregularity made by lawyer Sidney Powell were \"crazy\". Even so, days later, he promoted a lawsuit she was about to file on Twitter. Prosecutors also cite an account of a White House staffer who, after the election, overheard Trump telling his wife, daughter and son-in-law, \"It doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell\". They say by December 5, 2020, the defendant was starting to think about Congress's role in the process. In an election likely to turn on a small shift of votes in a small number of states, seemingly small things could end up being of out-sized significance.  \"For the first time, he mentioned to Pence the possibility of challenging the election results in the House of Representatives\", it says, citing a phone call. Prosecutors also argue Trump used his Twitter account to further his illegal scheme by spreading false claims of election fraud and exhorting his supporters to travel to Washington for the January 6, 2021 certification. They intend to use \"forensic evidence\" from Trump's iPhone to provide insight into the former president's actions after the attack at the Capitol. That \"steady stream of disinformation\" in the weeks after the election culminated in his speech at the Ellipse on the morning of January 6, 2021, in which Trump \"used these lies to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and disrupt the certification proceeding,\" prosecutors wrote. His \"personal desperation was at its zenith\" that morning as he was \"only hours from the certification proceeding that spelled the end,\" prosecutors wrote.

(AP Photo: David Zalubowski) A former Colorado county clerk has been sentenced to nine years in jail for charges relating to a breach in her county's voting system.  Tina Peters became \"fixated\" on voting problems after becoming involved with those who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results. She was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state. A judge has sentenced a former Colorado county clerk to nine years in prison for a data breach scheme stemming from false claims of voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race. District Judge Matthew Barrett told former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters — who earlier repeated discredited claims about rigged voting machines — that she never took her job seriously. \"I am convinced you would do it all over again if you could. You're as defiant as any defendant this court has ever seen,\" Judge Barrett told her at sentencing. \"You are no hero. You abused your position and you're a charlatan.\" Jurors found Peters guilty in August for allowing a man to misuse a security card to access the Mesa County election system and for being deceptive about that person's identity. Donald Trump laid the groundwork to try overturn the 2020 election even before he lost, knowingly pushed false claims of voter fraud, and \"resorted to crimes\" in his failed bid to cling to power, according to a newly unsealed court filing.  The man was affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from former president Donald Trump. The discredited claims trace back to Trump himself, whose supporters attacked the US Capitol because of them and who still hints at them in his third run for president. At trial, prosecutors said Peters, a Republican, was seeking fame and became \"fixated\" on voting problems after becoming involved with those who had questioned the accuracy of the presidential election results. A one-time hero to election deniers, Peters has been unapologetic about what happened. Before being sentenced, Peters insisted that everything she did to try to uncover what she believed was fraud was for the greater good. \"I've never done anything with malice to break the law. I've only wanted to serve the people of Mesa County,\" she told the court. When Peters persisted with claims that no legal authority had corroborated about \"wireless devices\" and fraud software in voting machines, however, she drew the judge's exasperation.

(Supplied: Fulton County Sheriff's Office via Reuters) Ballot recounts showed no discrepancies, he pointed out. \"I've let you go on enough about this,\" the judge said. \"The votes are the votes.\" Later, the judge noted that Peters has kept up public appearances in broadcasts to sympathetic audiences for her own benefit. \"It's just more lies. No objective person believes them. No, at the end of the day, you cared about the jets, the podcasts and people fawning over you,\" he said. Peters had the right to be defiant, he noted, but it was \"certainly not helpful for her lot today\". The breach led by Peters heightened concerns that rogue election workers sympathetic to partisan lies could use their access and knowledge to attack voting processes from within. It's impossible to overestimate the damage Peters has done to other election workers in Colorado and elsewhere, Colorado County Clerks Association director Matt Crane told the court. \"In a real and specific way, her actions have led directly to death threats and general threats to the lives and the families of the people who work in our elections,\" Mr Crane said. \"She has willingly aided individuals in our country who believe that violence is a way to make a point. She has knowingly fuelled a fire within others who choose threats as a means to get their way.\" He, his wife and his children have been among those threatened, Mr Crane said. In Mesa County — a scenic, mostly rural area on the Colorado Western Slope known for its peaches, vineyards and mountain biking as well as oil and gas drilling — Peters's actions have cost the local government $US1.4 million ($2 million) in legal fees and lost employee time, County Commissioner Cody Davis estimated at the sentencing hearing. Also, Peters's notoriety has incurred \"unseen costs\" for the area, Mr Davis told the court. \"We have a lot of pride in this community but our reputation has taken a hit,\" Mr Davis said. \"Her behaviour has made this county a national laughing stock.\" Peters was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state. She was found not guilty of identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and one count of criminal impersonation. Yet she persisted on social media to accuse Colorado-based Dominion Voting Systems, which made her county's election system, and others of stealing votes. Colorado won't allow anyone to threaten its elections, Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement in response to Peters's sentencing. \"Colorado's elections are the nation's gold standard. I am proud of how we have responded to the first insider elections breach in the nation and look forward to another secure and successful election in November,\" Ms Griswold said. Attorney-General Phil Weiser in a statement called the sentence \"fair and just\".

Donald Trump has returned to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally with a massive crowd of supporters in a critical swing state he hopes to return to his column in November's election. The former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear.  A series of shots, two dead and a bloodied ear: what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania at the former president's campaign rally. He began his speech with, \"As I was saying,\" and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began. \"… Right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together,\" he said.  \"We've bled.\"  Mr Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November.  Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states. The Trump campaign worked to maximise the event's headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against the vice-president.  At the beginning of the rally, Mr Trump asked for a moment of silence to honour firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire.  Standing behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Mr Trump called the would-be assassin \"a vicious monster\" and said he did not succeed \"by the hand of providence and the grace of God\".  There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcement officers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.

Mr Musk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has pushed into conservative politics, met with Mr Trump and running mate JD Vance backstage, donning a black \"Make America Great Again\" hat.  Earlier on Saturday, Mr Vance criticised Democrats for calling Mr Trump \"a threat to democracy\", saying that kind of language was \"inflammatory\". \"You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, 'Fight, fight!'\" said Mr Vance, who was chosen as his vice-presidential nominee less than two days later.  A massive crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the expansive field stretching to the venue's edges.  Much of the crowd waited several hours for Mr Trump.  About half an hour into his speech, Mr Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic.

During the podcast, Harris responded to Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, having previously complained he didn't want the country run by \"childless cat ladies\". \"I just think it's mean and mean-spirited,\" Ms Harris said. She also rejected Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders's suggestion the Democratic presidential candidate is not humble because she does not have biological children. Ms Harris said the Arkansas governor's views on family were outdated and discussed her own \"modern family\" — which includes her husband, Doug Emhoff, and his two children from his first marriage, Cole and Ella. During a town hall she moderated for Donald Trump in Michigan in September, Ms Sanders said that her kids keep her \"humble\" while Harris \"doesn't have anything keeping her humble\". Ms Harris responded on the podcast, \"I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble. \"Two, a whole lot of women out there who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.

Ms Harris also said family comes in many forms. \"We have our family by blood, and then we have our family by love, and I have both, and I consider it to be a real blessing,\" she said. \"And I have two beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who call me Momala. We have a very modern family. My husband's ex-wife is a friend of mine.\" Ms Harris and Cooper discussed abortion rights during the podcast, with the Democratic nominee saying in her travels she's seen people who were historically opposed to abortion \"now seeing what's happening and saying, 'Hmm, I didn't intend for all this to happen,'\" after health problems arose in the wake of Roe v Wade's repeal. Ms Harris dinged Trump, as she has in recent speeches, saying \"this guy is full of lies\" when he talks about abortion and other issues. The governor's office and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Although Ms Harris has previously not been known to give interviews, the Call Her Daddy appearance will become a lot less rare over the next month. The Democratic nominee is set to appear on CBS's 60 Minutes, the US ABC's The View, CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and The Howard Stern Show this week as part of a broader media outreach effort to boost her support in the final 30 days of the campaign against Trump.

(AP Photo: Charlie Neibergall) The FBI has arrested an Afghan man for allegedly plotting a terror attack on election day. Authorities say Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi was planning the attack in the name of Islamic State. Mr Tawhedi and a juvenile co-conspirator were arrested after trying to buy AK-47 rifles. An Afghan man has been arrested for allegedly planning a terror attack on election day in the United States. The FBI said Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was plotting the attack in the name of Islamic State and was going to target large crowds.  Mr Tawhedi and a juvenile co-conspirator were arrested after they attempted to buy two AK-47 rifles and ammunition, the FBI said. He also allegedly liquidated his family's assets and bought one-way tickets to Afghanistan for his wife and child. The FBI said Mr Tawhedi told investigators he and his alleged co-conspirator had expected to die as \"martyrs\" during the planned attack. In a statement, FBI director Christopher Wray said terrorism was \"still the department's number one priority\" and authorities would \"use every resource to protect the American people\". Mr Tawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to Islamic State, considered a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. Mr Tawhedi had been living in the US since 2021 on a special immigrant visa. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security said the US threat environment was expected to remain high in the coming year due to several factors, including the 2024 election and the war in Gaza.  US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the government would \"continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS [Islamic State]  and its supporters pose to America's national security\". \"We will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorise the American people,\" he said in a statement. The Islamic State terrorist organisation killed thousands of people before it was defeated in Iraq in 2017 and Syria in 2019.

(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) US citizens who live overseas rarely get the attention of politicians in the lead up to elections. But this year \"candidates are looking for votes under every rock they can find\". With millions of US citizens living overseas, their votes could help decide crucial states. Americans living overseas rarely vote, with just 7.8 per cent participating in the 2020 election. And US politicians rarely pay them any attention, even though there were roughly 4.4 million of them in 2022. But in an election looking to be incredibly tight, things are a little different. US Vote Foundation CEO Susan Dzieduszycka has spent two decades helping overseas citizens vote and this election has brought an unprecedented level of attention. \"The overseas vote this year is coming under a level of scrutiny that we've never had before,\" she said. \"There's been some gaslighting already where there's going to be this claim that non-citizens are voting from overseas. \"But I believe this will stand up to scrutiny.\" Most US expats live in North America and Europe, with significant populations in the Asia Pacific. ( Source: 2022 Federal Voting Assistance Program Report to Congress) The sudden interest in international voting has been fuelled, in part, by former president Donald Trump, who last month claimed without evidence that anyone living overseas can get a ballot mailed to them, even if they are ineligible to vote. At the same time, the Democrats are ramping up efforts to secure international support, with the party investing almost $US500,000 in the Democrats Abroad advocacy group. Ms Dzieduszycka said the \"fantasies of voter fraud\" were \"completely unfounded\". \"The ballot request system complies with the same rigorous security checks and verification as US domestic processes, including voter identification verification and signature matching,\" she said. \"Election officials give more scrutiny, not less, to overseas applications.\" Democrats Aboard are busy handing out \"how to vote\" buttons to American expats in Australia. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard) Meanwhile, absentee voting rights enshrined in the 1986 Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act are being challenged in the courts. The Republican National Committee launched a lawsuit in North Carolina this week, arguing the act undermines the state's own residency requirements, allowing people who have never lived in North Carolina to vote. That may include those born overseas to US parents, who gain citizenship by descent. Ms Dzieduszycka said while these types of lawsuits delay vote counting, she \"welcomes any scrutiny\". Even though Taiwan is thousands of kilometres away, its importance to US-China relations is often discussed in US politics. (Reuters: Stephan Lam) While the whims and woes of US politics may be thousands of kilometres away, the election could have real and lasting impacts on expats like Trent Jackson. For the past eight years, he has lived in Taiwan, an island that China has long wanted to reclaim and which many pundits fear could spark the next global conflict. \"From both political parties, there's always been strong support for Taiwan,\" Mr Jackson said. \"But it is worrying when sometimes, maybe Trump will say Taiwan is stealing semiconductors from the US or that Taiwan is a bargaining chip with China. Trent Jackson believes voting is his civic duty, even if he lives overseas. (Supplied) \"We want Taiwan to be protected. We want democracy to flourish here.\" Participating in the democratic process is relatively easy for Mr Jackson; he has watched all the election debates on YouTube and can vote via email under the laws of his home state, Washington. And he would oppose any attempt to curtail his voting rights. \"It's my right and duty as a citizen to vote,\" he said. \"I can't vote at all in Taiwan, so it's my one chance to voice my opinions, my political opinions.\" Japan is the sixth-most popular country for US expats. (Supplied: Unsplash) The overseas voting act protects the rights of US citizens living, working or studying abroad, along with military service personnel and their families. The expat community has grown 42 per cent since 2010, with the top destination being Canada, with about 606,000 adult citizens, followed by the United Kingdom with just under 300,000. In the Asia Pacific, Australia has the fifth most US adults at nearly 111,000, followed by Japan at 101,000, and Taiwan in 10th place at about 57,000. The low turnout of these millions of voters may be due to the difficulty in registering, according to political science adjunct professor at Tokyo's Temple University, Paul Nadeau. \"It's already a little bit more complicated in America to vote than it is in a lot of other places,\" he said. \"And when you're living abroad, the rules aren't always clear and obvious. Some states have different rules and requirements for eligibility in terms of residency.\" The US Vote Foundation has tried to simplify the process and dispel myths with its Overseas Vote website, which provides information on how to vote in each state. For his part, Professor Nadeau encourages all his students to register to vote, even though there may be better ways to get Americans to the polls. \"If there's one innovation I wish we could take from the Australians, it's democracy sausages,\" he said. \"Make it into an event, make people turn up and get together. \"Go cast your ballot, grab a hot dog.\" Permanent resident of Japan Maurice Shelton believes local activism has more of an impact than the ballot box. (Supplied) Professor Nadeau isn't surprised by the high level of interest in the overseas vote this year given 2024 is a \"big election\". \"It's a very clear, very decisive choice between two very distinct candidates,\" he said. \"That context has made a lot of people more engaged, more concerned, more plugged in than they would be otherwise.\" Ms Dzieduszycka said politicians were also \"finally realising that there is an underused right to vote abroad\". \"Candidates are looking for votes under every rock they can find.\" But despite the high stakes in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, the turnout rate of overseas voters remained under 8 per cent compared to around two-thirds of those living at home. Maurice Shelton has lived in Japan for more than a decade and while he has voted in the past, he believes local activism is more powerful than \"electoral politics\". \"Because I'm a Black American, I have a peculiar view on how electoral politics can shape the outlook, whether it's economic or social, of certain communities,\" he said. \"Being on the outside looking in now, it's giving me a little bit more clarity in terms of how little the presidential election matters for people who are rank and file, just regular workers. \"The Electoral College is very anti-democratic. We are ruled by a duopoly that has not taken the interest of the common worker and the common person in forever. \"There are so many other things that we could do to affect real change and cause actual progress for the betterment of everybody around the world.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Nick Bryant Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Asia Australia Community and Society Electoral Fraud Japan Political Parties and Movements Taiwan US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Not Professor Allan Lichtman. Since 1984, Lichtman has been predicting presidential elections. In 10 races over four decades, he has a near-perfect record. Nicknamed \"Nostradamus\", he's credited with being one of the few experts to project a Donald Trump victory in 2016, although critics say he predicted Trump would win the popular vote, which he lost. Professor Allan Lichtman correctly predicted a Donald Trump victory in the 2016 election. (Reuters: Carlo Allegri) He uses a method developed with Russian scientist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, renowned for making earthquake predictions. \"We looked at every American presidential election from 1860 to 1980 using the methods of pattern recognition,\" Dr Lichtman told 7.30. Based on those patterns, Dr Lichtman developed a method that uses 13 keys to project the winner. His indicators include incumbency, short and long-term economy, social unrest, and White House scandals. Professor Allan Lichtman has been predicting US presidential elections since 1984.  (AFP: Pedro Ugarte) \"They reflected the basic proposition that American presidential elections are primarily votes up or down on the strength and performance of the White House Party,\" he said. \"The big message is that it's governing, not campaigning, that counts.\" As poll after poll finds the margins between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are razor thin, Dr Lichtman believes what happens on the campaign trail doesn't make any difference to the outcome. This year, he says, the keys point to Ms Harris being able to unlock the White House. \"It's real simple. If five or fewer keys go against the White House Party, they're predicted winners. If six or more go against the White House Party, they're predicted losers. So, six strikes and you're out,\" he said. \"I deliberately made my prediction before the Harris-Trump debate … because I wanted to make my big point that the keys are pretty much set because they're based primarily on governing.\" This time around, Professor Lichtman is projecting a Harris-Walz victory. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) \"The keys point to America getting a path-breaking president, the first female president, at least cracking, if not shattering the glass ceiling, and the first president of mixed African and Asian descent.\" Dr Lichtman is an outlier. Most political analysts watching the Harris and Trump campaigns battle it out believe the election is simply too close to call. For weeks, the average of national polls in the US has shown Ms Harris with a slight edge over Trump. But in America, national support doesn't determine who wins the White House. The Electoral College does. Each state's Electoral College votes are determined by its population. For nearly all states, no matter the margin, if you win the state, you get all its votes. And it takes 270 Electoral College votes to win. Most analysts believe this year's election will come down to seven battleground states.  (Reuters: Bryan Woolston) Most experts believe this year's election will come down to seven swing states: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. These are the so-called battlegrounds that could vote either way. Most other states are considered to be safely in the Democrat or Republican column. That means when it comes to the race for the White House, 43 states are essentially bystanders. \"This time you have a close national election, but so few of the states are actually competitive, so you really do see a laser focus on the handful of states that are really up for grabs,\" said Kyle Kondik of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Kyle Kondik says very few states are actually competitive in the national election.  (\nABC News: Cameron Schwarz\n) Kondik believes the \"shrinking\" of the presidential campaign map is a direct result of the Electoral College, which goes back to the founding of the United States. \"This is not a system that you would necessarily design from scratch if you were starting it today. But that's the system that we have.\" Australian political researcher and historian Emma Shortis lived in the US and completed her PhD there. She believes the shift away from presidential elections fought nationally in many states across America is a new phenomenon. Political researcher Emma Shortis has lived and studied in the US.  (ABC News: Michael Nudl) \"It is a real change, and a relatively recent one where so few states are up for grabs,\" Dr Shortis told 7.30. \"It's worth remembering that a lot of it is also down to a concerted and long-time effort to gerrymander states, so to manipulate electoral systems at the state level so that they become safe. \"They become really locked up by one party or the other.\" And no matter who wins the election, Dr Shortis believes America's great political divide isn't going away. No matter who wins, the political divide in the US is likely to continue after the November election. \"We won't have the answer to the question of American politics kind of wrapped up in a nice little present for us,\" she said. \"The divisions and the volatility, the dangerous state that American politics finds itself in is likely to continue long after the fifth of November.\" Watch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV Do you know more about this story?

(AP Photo: Ross D Franklin) US Vice-President Kamala Harris is in \"excellent health\" and \"possesses the physical and mental resiliency\" required to serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released on Saturday that summarises her medical history and status. Dr Joshua Simmons, a US Army colonel and physician to the vice-president, wrote that Ms Harris, 59, maintains a healthy, active lifestyle and that her most recent physical last April was \"unremarkable\". She \"possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,\" he wrote in a two-page letter. Ms Harris's presidential campaign hopes to use the moment to draw a contrast with Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has released only limited information about his health over the years, according to a campaign aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The aide said the campaign hopes that highlighting Ms Harris's comparative youth and mental acuity with Mr Trump's more advanced age and tendency to meander, along with the differences in transparency between the two, will help convince undecided voters she is more fit for office. Dr Simmons, who has been Ms Harris's primary care physician for the past three and a half years, said the vice-president has a history of allergies and urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen immunotherapy for the past three years. He said Ms Harris's latest blood work and other test results were \"unremarkable\". \"Vice-President Harris maintains a healthy, active lifestyle despite her busy schedule, including vigorous daily aerobic exercise and core strength training,\" he said. \"She eats a very healthy diet. She does not use tobacco products and drinks only occasionally and in moderation.\" The report also notes that Ms Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; and she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms. As the vice-president's office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Mr Trump's health and mental acuity, and his failure to provide information about his health status and medical history. Since the end of the presidency of Barack Obama, who was 47 when he took his first oath of office, American democracy has seemed more like an American gerontocracy. Mr Trump, 78, eagerly questioned President Joe Biden's health when the 81-year-old president was seeking re-election earlier this year. Since Mr Biden was replaced on the ticket with Ms Harris, Mr Trump's own health has drawn more attention. Mr Trump has released very little health information, including after his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in July. Last November, Mr Trump marked Mr Biden's birthday by releasing a letter from his own physician that reported the former president was in \"excellent\" physical and mental health. However, the letter, posted on Mr Trump's social media platform, contained no details to support its claims — measures like weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test. A physician who wrote a glowing review of Mr Trump's health in 2015, including a line that Mr Trump would be \"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\" at the time, later said Mr Trump himself had dictated the letter.

The now 27-year-old was raised in a religious, Hispanic household in the state's capital, Phoenix. And when she became pregnant at the age of 16, she says she was \"offended\" by the question of whether she would consider having an abortion. But a decade on, Lesley's perspective has shifted to the point where she's now campaigning to try to guarantee abortion access in her home state. \"It's expensive,\" she says of raising her daughter.  \"You have to give up a lot, and if you don't have help, or you're not wealthy, it's very hard. \"Personally, I'm against abortion for myself, but I don't want to take that right from anybody.\" Reproductive access have become a major political issue in the United States since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade in 2022, ending the nation-wide right to abortion. The decision, made possible by then-president Donald Trump's appointment of three conservative justices to the court, paved the way for more than a dozen states to introduce bans. Vice-president Kamala Harris is hoping American women will drive a political backlash against her opponent that will help to fuel her own bid for the White House. But the election outcome is likely to come down to a handful of battleground states.  In all seven electorates that will likely decide the winner, opinion polls suggest an extraordinarily tight race between Trump and Harris. Many of the polls are within the margin of error, meaning the result is still too difficult to predict this far out from November 5. Arizona, with its prized 11 electoral college votes that could give either Harris or Trump the magic 270 figure they need to claim the White House, is also achingly close.  And the contest here is as heated as its scorching temperatures. At her small, independently-run abortion clinic on the outskirts of Phoenix, Dr DeShawn Taylor has experienced a tumultuous few years. When Roe was overturned, she says she first felt numb, and then angry. The decision effectively upheld a law, passed in anticipation of the court's ruling, that prohibited abortions in Arizona after 15 weeks of pregnancy. But it also raised the question of whether a near-total ban that was first introduced in 1864, but was technically still on the books, could be reinstated. \"People have complex feelings about abortion, but what I want people to understand is that doesn't mean that a lawmaker gets to dictate what care someone can receive,\" Dr Taylor says. \"Republicans have abortions, libertarians have abortions, Democrats have abortions. Because why? It is a medical procedure.\" The 1864 law was eventually repealed, and the 15-week ban remains in place today. But pro-abortion rights advocates succeeded in their effort to put the question of future access to the people of Arizona at the upcoming election. It means when voters have their say on who they want to be president, they'll also be asked whether the state's constitution should be changed to enshrine a \"fundamental right\" to abortion. Katarina White, from the group Arizona Right to Life, is working to try to prevent that from happening. \"I'm part of a large Italian family, my parents all raised us Catholic,\" she says. \"And ever since I understood how human life begins, my dad also paired that conversation with why we disagree with abortion. \"I think I was like, 14, and that was kind of it.\" The amendment, known as Proposition 139, would guarantee abortion access up until the point of \"fetal viability\" — when a fetus could potentially live outside the mother's body, which is usually considered to be around 24 weeks. After that, an abortion could still be carried out if a healthcare professional considered it necessary to \"protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual\".  Katarina argues that goes too far. She's spending all the time she can at churches across Phoenix in an effort to encourage local parishioners to vote against the amendment. \"They [the opposing side] make us seem like we don't care about women, and that's just not the truth,\" she says. \"My stance is not extreme. I would love to help women, you know, figure out what to do next in a time of crisis, or if they're in a dangerous situation themselves, but you know, it doesn't have to be abortion or give up your life.\" Kamala Harris has made reproductive rights a major focus of her presidential campaign, decrying what she calls \"Trump abortion bans\".  The lack of compulsory voting in the US means political candidates face the constant challenge of having to motivate their supporters to show up for them on election day. And so Democrats are hoping that if people feel strongly enough about abortion rights, they'll be more inclined to vote for the vice-president. \"I certainly think it's going to drive women to the ballot box more than previously,\" says Eva Burch, a Democratic state senator in Arizona. Senator Burch made headlines earlier this year when she used a speech on the Arizona Senate floor to reveal that she was scheduled to have an abortion later that week to end an unviable pregnancy. \"I don't know how many of you have been unfortunate enough to experience a miscarriage before but I am not interested in going through it unnecessarily,\" she said at the time. \"And right now, the safest and most appropriate treatment for me, and the treatment that I choose, is abortion.\" Senator Burch says her experience is not uncommon, and that she shared it to draw attention to the personal impacts of abortion laws. She's confident the ballot measure in Arizona will pass, especially considering similar measures have already succeeded in more conservative-leaning states such Kansas and Ohio. Trump has also taken notice of the results in those electorates. The former president claims credit for helping to overturn Roe, arguing power over abortion belongs with the states. But he's previously argued Republicans who \"poorly handled\" the issue by introducing bans with few exceptions were to blame for his party's weaker than expected performance in the 2022 midterm elections. He's since continued to distance himself from the strictest laws around the country, and called for exceptions in cases of rape or incest, or where the mother's life is at risk. \"I think [the exceptions are] very important. Some people don't. Follow your heart,\" he said in June. \"But you have to get elected also.\" Trump’s position has upset some in the anti-abortion movement. Katarina White describes Trump's recent comments as being \"kind of hard for me to stomach\". \"I know that abortion at any point is wrong,\" she argues.  But she's still planning on voting for the former president. \"I know if I don't vote for Donald Trump, it's just another vote for Kamala Harris,\" she says. \"And if Kamala Harris becomes the president, it just puts us back even further in the pro-life movement than we want to be.\" While abortion is currently dominating a lot of the attention in Arizona, there are several big election issues at play across the state. Rapid population growth in cities like Phoenix has added to the housing and cost of living pressures being felt all over the country. Arizona is also a border state. Head south from Phoenix and you'll eventually get to the US boundary with Mexico, meaning immigration policy is front and centre. On the southern border of the US, the Texas governor has taken drastic steps to keep migrants out of the country, and to reshape the political debate inside it. Cristina Junge campaigns for the former president as part of his 'Latino Americans for Trump' group. It's a demographic that has traditionally shown more support for Democrats, but Cristina believes that's changing. \"I think that Latinos, we are very much of what Trump is. He believes in the family, number one, that is the most important, the family is the base of society,\" she says. \"So [I] believe in God, in the family, in freedom and in my country.\" Cristina moved to the US from Colombia in the 1960s and is now an American citizen. \"I came legally, of course,\" she says from her retirement village west of Phoenix. But she's angry at the number of people who have crossed the southern border without authorisation since President Joe Biden and Harris were in office. And she thinks immigration will be one of the most powerful issues for voters in November. \"We need to close the border, we need to continue building the wall,\" she says. Cristina is critical of Harris as a candidate, and rejects the notion that American women would be better off under the country's potential first ever female president. \"They want to make [Trump] like this bad man,\" she says. \"No, he is a man, a human being, and he's not perfect. I don't think that there is a perfect human being in the world that you can talk about. \"But he is the man that we need at this moment.\" Lesley Chavez thinks otherwise. She believes a Harris presidency — \"if she does it correctly\" — would open doors for other women across the country. And she scoffs at the former president's recent claim that he'd be a \"protector\" of women if he's elected. \"You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today,\" Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania last month.  \"You will be protected, and I will be your protector.\" Lesley says she thinks Trump is \"really smart financially\".  \"He would help us out financially,\" she says. \"But … I think he's racist, and he absolutely hates women. I mean, he's made it very clear.\" Polls suggest Trump currently holds a narrow lead over Harris in Arizona. But in this state, like the others that could go either way, the race is still considered too close to call.

The suspect, identified as Vem Miller, a resident of Las Vegas, was driving a black SUV that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. The 49-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possessing a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine, the department said. The investigation found the Secret Service and  other security agencies had no plan for coverage of the building where the shooter climbed up to fire the shots.  He was eventually released on bail and will appear in court over the state firearms charges at a later date.  The man gave all indication he belonged there and was allowed in to the event as a member of the press, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told reporters.  \"We know he claimed to be a journalist, and he claimed to have VIP status to the event that got him into the perimeter, and when that investigation was continued by the deputy, that didn't necessarily materialise,\" Sheriff Bianco said. \"So other than his words that he was a journalist ... I can't tell you that he gave us a document and we said that was fake.\" Media members, as well as VIP ticket holders, were routed through a number of intersections manned by state and local law enforcement officers before arriving at a large, grassy area where drivers were asked to open hoods and trunks, and each vehicle was searched by a canine officer. Republican presidential nominee Trump holds a rally in Coachella.  (Reuters: Mike Blake ) Other general ticket holders were directed to a site roughly 5 kilometres away from the rally, where they were boarded onto buses and driven to the site. Sheriff Bianco said he believed his deputies \"probably prevented a third assassination attempt\" by taking the man into custody.  \"If you're asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that prevented the third assassination attempt,\" he said. \"If we are that politically lost that we have lost sight of common sense, of reality, and for that reason that we can't say, 'Holy crap, what did he show up with all of that stuff for, and loaded guns?' and I'm going to be accused of being dramatic? \"Then we have a serious problem in this country.\" He also praised the work of local deputies conducting checks on the outer perimeter of the rally.  \"Thank God, and by an act of really what we did in the week leading up to keeping that place secure, I certainly wouldn't want to be saying after the fact that I wish we would have done more to prevent that shooting,\" he said. The sheriff declined to speculate about the suspect's motives or frame of mind.  \"We know we prevented something bad from happening, and it was irrelevant what that bad was going to be,\" he said. \"There is absolutely no way that any of us are going to truly know what was in his head.\" Donald Trump returns to Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a rally with heightened security and guest Elon Musk.  Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest. The sheriff said further investigations will be conducted by the FBI and Secret Service.  The Secret Service said that it was aware of the arrest and that neither Trump nor rally attendees had not been in any danger during the incident. \"While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing,\" the organisation tasked with protecting presidents and presidential candidates said in a joint statement with the FBI and the US Attorney's office.

(AFP: Paul J. Richards) When Americans turn up to the ballot box next month, it could be the tightest election in more than two decades, according to a US politics expert. The two candidates, Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, have been neck and neck in most polls, with US election analysts forecasting that either candidate could win come election day. One of those election analysts, FiveThirtyEight, explored polling as well as economic and demographic data in its analysis of the upcoming election. In its simulations, FiveThirtyEight found Harris won 53 times out of 100, while Trump won 47 times out of 100. Here's how this upcoming election compares to one of the closest in American history. University of Sydney associate professor David Smith, who specialises in US politics, believes there hasn't been a US election this close since 2000, based on polling. \"What we see in the national polling is that Kamala Harris has a very slight lead, but in all of the swing states, it's less than a two-point lead, and in most of them, it's less than a one-point lead,\" Dr Smith said. \"When the polling is that close, it's impossible to say who has the lead.\" Dr Smith explained those polls were usually conducted with sample sizes of about one or two thousand people, and a 1 per cent difference between them was within the poll's margin of error. \"The fact that nearly all the polls that we see in most of the states are so close, it just makes it a lot harder to predict than any election in recent memory,\" he said. \"It's getting to the point where whenever I see a new poll, it doesn't really tell me anything new about who's going to win the election.\" The US election in 2000 was among the most controversial in the country's history but also one of the closest. Republican candidate George W Bush won the electoral college but ended up losing the popular vote to the Democrat candidate by about half a million votes. Hundreds of votes separated the candidates in Florida and vice-president Al Gore demanded a recount. A 36-day political and legal war ensured over \"how to resolve what was essentially a tie\", according to the Brookings Institute. \"Bush ultimately garnered the presidency when a sharply divided and transparently political Supreme Court ended the manual recount in Florida that might have produced a different outcome,\" the institute said. \"It was the closest presidential election in American history, with only several hundred votes in Florida determining the winner out of more than 100 million ballots cast nationwide.\" Dr Smith said there were riots around some of the vote counting stations in Florida, which later became known as the Brooks Brothers riots. \"In Florida back in 2000, the margin was fewer than 1,000 votes … so it was close enough that neither side was prepared to accept the result,\" he said. But \"the political atmosphere [now] has become more violent\", he said, citing the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, after Trump lost the election. \"In 2020, there were a couple of results that came down to 10 or 11,000 votes,\" he said. \"And that was a big enough margin that none of the kinds of challenges that Republicans were mounting really stood any chance.\" Australian National University's Wesley Widmaier referenced the increasing polarisation in US politics as one of the reasons why this US election might be close. \"Especially since the global financial crisis, it's a very polarised society … it's not just red and blue,\" he said. \"There's a professional educated elite which does not know how to talk to the other side of the country, and then the other side of the country looks at that professional elite and resents them. \"So that's made it very difficult to achieve consensus because you have these two world views which are in intensifying conflict with one another.\" Dr Smith says US elections often come down to the swing states. He referenced the 2020 election, when Democrat Joe Biden defeated incumbent Republican president Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and by four percentage points in the popular vote. NPR reported that \"just 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from a tie in the electoral college\". Dr Smith said: \"The reason why these elections appear so close is because of the electoral college system.\" \"It is decided within these key states, where the results can be a lot closer. If it was decided at the national level, you could still have pretty close results, but it wouldn't be anything like this close.\" That's why Dr Smith said the electoral college was not a good system for deciding a presidential election. \"There's no need for geographic representation, it's the person who is representing the entire country,\" he said. \"It really undermines the principle that everybody's vote has the same value because it doesn't in the system of the electoral college. \"I think it's a very archaic system that is left over from a different period of American politics where the president wasn't elected directly.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

At a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, the vice-president played soundbites of Trump in a recent interview, in which he spoke about an \"enemy within\" being more dangerous than Russia. If you're just tuning in as the campaign trail nears its end, here's what you need to know about this year's US election.  The former president used the term at a speech in Coachella, California, on Saturday in reference to Democrats, particularly targeting Congressman Adam Schiff, who is currently running for the Senate. He repeated the phrase in an interview with Fox News the following day, claiming Democrats plan to create \"chaos\" on November 5, the day of the presidential election. \"I think the bigger problem are the people from within,\" he said on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures program. \"We have some very bad people, we have some sick people. \"It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.\" Ms Harris hit back at her rally in the battleground state on Monday, telling the crowd the consequences of Trump becoming president again are \"brutally serious\". \"He considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country,\" she said. \"He is saying he would use the military to go after them. \"And we know who he would target because he has attacked them before: journalists whose stories he doesn't like, election officials who refuse to cheat by filling extra votes and finding 'extra votes' for him, judges who insist on following the law instead of bending to his will. \"This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.\" The vice-president's trip to Pennsylvania on Monday was her tenth to the battleground state since she announced her candidacy for president in July.  The state's 19 electoral college votes will be pivotal to the election outcome. Her comments came the same day her campaign launched a new attack ad against Trump. The 30-second video features a supercut of Trump speaking about \"the enemy from within\" and features comments from two former members of his administration. \"A second term would be worse. There would be no one to stop his worst instincts,\" former Trump administration official Kevin Carroll says in the ad. \"Unchecked power, no guardrails.

Mr Trump wrapped up the event early but remained on stage while music played and the crowd watched on. Kamala Harris's campaign continues to challenge Mr Trump on his fitness to run for president A campaign event for Donald Trump ended with an impromptu singalong after he asked for music to be played to the crowd for more than half an hour. The US presidential candidate wrapped up his event ahead of schedule but remained on stage while songs from artists including Luciano Pavarotti and Elvis played. Mr Trump's impromptu music session went for 39 minutes. \"He stayed on stage for nine songs … with the ex-president alternating his dance moves with standing in place and staring into the crowd,\" an AFP report said. Video of Mr Trump swaying along to the music was shared widely on social media. Commentary about the event played into the hands of Mr Trump's political opponent Kamala Harris, whose campaign has been challenging his health and mental fitness as the election looms. Mr Trump was holding a question-and-answer event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem when an audience member became ill. Both politicians mentioned that it was quite hot in the venue. While paramedics treated the person, Mr Trump requested Ave Maria be played, with an instrumental version of the song blaring over the speakers. He resumed speaking after the audience member was taken away on a stretcher. The audience member raised a fist into the air while being wheeled out on a stretcher.  (AP: Alex Brandon) But shortly after, a second member of the audience required help, with the crowd yelling \"it's steaming in here\". The instrumental version of Ave Maria resumed again while the person was being tended to, with Mr Trump asking about opening the doors to the venue. \"I wish we could open those doors to outside … for security reasons, I can't,\" he told the crowd. After the second person was confirmed to be up and moving, Mr Trump resumed speaking again. The venue later addressed concerns about heat on social media. \"The massive turnout and extensive lighting and AV proved to be more than the systems in the main event hall could keep up with,\" it said. He then asked his team to display his \"favourite chart\" while Luciano Pavarotti's rendition of Ave Maria played. Footage of the event lifestreamed on YouTube by US broadcaster PBS News showed Mr Trump nodding and swaying along to the music. If you're just tuning in as the campaign trail nears its end, here's what you need to know about this year's US election.  About three minutes later, Mr Trump started speaking again. \"Let's not do any more questions, let's just listen to music,\" he said. \"When we leave, you don't have to go so fast, you can sit and listen … we'll play a couple of songs.\" A few minutes later, Mr Trump and Ms Noem appeared to signal the end of the event. They thanked the crowd as Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli's version of Time To Say Goodbye began playing over the speakers. Then a version of It's a Man's World, sung by James Brown and Luciano Pavarotti played, with Mr Trump still on stage. Mr Trump later called the event a \"great evening\".  (Retuers: David Muse) \"This has been an honour tonight, we could probably do another question or two,\" Mr Trump told the crowd once the song ended. Mr Trump then encouraged people to vote for him in the November election. \"We're gonna go, we're gonna vote, we're gonna have a good time … I want this to be a really important evening,\" Mr Trump said. \"And those two people that went down are patriots and we love them. \"And because of them, we ended up with some good music, right? So play YMCA. Go ahead. Let's go. Nice and loud.\" The Village People's disco anthem YMCA is typically the song Mr Trump's team plays as he exits the stage at public events. But when the song, which goes for more than three minutes, finished playing, Mr Trump was still on stage. He remained in front of the crowd swaying along to Rufus Wainwight's version of Hallelujah, Sinéad O'Connor's Nothing Compares 2 U and Elvis Presley's An American Trilogy. The PBS livestream cut out shortly after Oliver Anthony Music's Rich Men North of Richmond started playing. According to The Washington Post, he walked off stage to Guns and Roses's November Rain but kept talking to the crowd while Memories from the musical Cats played. Mr Trump played a mixture of pop, country and classical music.  (AP: Alex Brandon) Mr Trump later said the event was \"amazing\" and \"a great evening\" on social media, with his campaign manager Steven Cheung calling the event a \"total lovefest\". However, Ms Harris's campaign used it to question Mr Trump's fitness to serve as president. Her campaign's X account said Mr Trump appeared \"lost, confused, and frozen on stage\", with Ms Harris retweeting the video saying \"hope he's ok\". It comes after Ms Harris's campaign published a report from her doctor saying she was in \"excellent health\" over the weekend. Ms Harris has been challenging Mr Trump on his fitness to run for the top job.  (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) On Tuesday night, Mr Trump asserted his health was fine and claimed Ms Harris's medical report was \"really bad\". \"With all of the problems that she has, there is a real question as to whether or not she should be running for president,\" he wrote on his Truth Social network. \"My report is perfect — no problems!\" Mr Trump has not released a recent comprehensive report on his state of health. At 78 years old, Mr Trump is now the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid. Ms Harris will turn 60 on Sunday. It will take place on Tuesday, November 5, in the US. It'll be the afternoon of Wednesday, November 6 in Australia by the time results start rolling in.

Earlier this month, the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated an abortion ban that would block the procedure from six weeks.  Reproductive health experts have raised fears that state abortion bans could also place IVF treatments in jeopardy. A conservative Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are children.  That ruling left it unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos, prompting some IVF patients to consider moving their frozen embryos out of the state. Trump said the issue was first raised to him by Alabama senator Katie Britt who he called \"fantastically attractive\".  \"I said, explain IVF very quickly, and within about two minutes I understood it,\" he told the town hall. \"I said no no, we're totally in favour of IVF.\"  Trump also called some state bans on abortions \"too tough\".  \"Those are going to be redone because already there's a movement in those states,\" he added.  Trump did not specify which states he was talking about.  Demonstrators protest Georgia's anti-abortion laws.  (Reuters: Elijah Nouvelage) Trump's campaign later described his \"father of IVF\" comment as a joke. \"It was a joke President Trump made in jest when he was enthusiastically answering a question about IVF as he strongly supports widespread access to fertility treatments for women and families,\" spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. Just weeks before the US election, polls suggest the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remains a dead heat. In the key battleground state of Arizona, abortion might be a deciding factor.  Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, when asked about Trump's comments, called them \"quite bizarre\".  \"What he should take responsibility for is that couples who are praying and hoping and working towards growing a family have been so disappointed and harmed by the fact that IVF treatments have now been put at risk,\" she said. \"Lets not be distracted by his choice of words. \"The reality is his actions have been very harmful to women and families in America.\"  Ms Harris has previously said she supports Congress passing a federal law that would protect abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, a landmark ruling which recognised a constitutional right to abortion. In August, Trump told NBC News that he wants IVF treatments to be paid for by government or insurance companies if elected, but has provided little detail on the plan since then.  In Georgia, the six-week abortion ban has been particularly divisive following the deaths of two mothers, Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who both died from \"preventable\" deaths after the ban was enacted, according to a ProPublica investigation. The state is among a handful likely to decide the election.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Abortion Reproduction and Contraception US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Ms Harris was also shown a video clip of a mother whose child was killed by an immigrant who illegally crossed the border.  \"I'm so sorry for her loss, but let's talk about what is happening right now,\" Ms Harris said.  Ms Harris said Trump told Republicans to reject a bipartisan immigration bill because \"he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem\". When asked about her recent comment that there was \"not a thing\" she would change about the Biden administration's actions, Ms Harris said \"my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency,\" but did not provide specifics. Ms Harris was further questioned about previously vouching for President Biden’s mental fitness for office, before he pulled out of the race.  Ms Harris was pressed on her position on using taxpayer funds for gender-affirming surgery for transgender inmates and said she will \"follow the law.\"  She added that the US Bureau of Prisons provided gender-affirming treatments under Trump and accused him of \"throwing stones\" while living in a glass house. The interview was part of a direct appeal by Ms Harris to Republican voters in November's US presidential election, as she highlighted in a battleground county in Pennsylvania before appearing on conservative-leaning Fox News. Earlier just outside Pennsylvania's largest city of Philadelphia, Ms Harris emphasised Trump's attempt to overturn his election loss four years ago after he lost to President Biden.

(ABC News: Brad Ryan) Two days after Donald Trump claimed Haitian migrants were eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio, the former president turned his attention to another part of America. \"A small, 4,000-person town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania – have you heard of it?\" Trump asked the crowd at a campaign rally in Arizona. \"Charleroi – a beautiful name, but it's not so beautiful now,\" he said, blaming a \"flood\" of Haitian migrants for \"bringing massive crime to the town\" and sending it \"virtually bankrupt\". In recent weeks, Trump has been dialling up the rhetoric about \"illegal aliens\" and \"migrant crime\" and promoting his promised \"mass deportation\" program. He says his plan will help \"every town that has been invaded and conquered\" by migrants who entered the US without authorisation. Donald Trump first spoke about Charleroi, Pennsylvania, at a rally in Tucson, Arizona. (Reuters: Mike Blake) But Charleroi's local council manager, Joe Manning, says Trump's claims about Haitians in his town are untrue.  \"Everybody that's here, to our knowledge, is here legally,\" he said. \"There was no spike in crime [and] we're not even close to being bankrupt.\" Regardless, the comments had inflamed local tensions and emboldened white supremacists, he said. Large stickers promoting a white nationalist group started to appear on traffic signal boxes downtown, and a flyer purportedly from the Ku Klux Klan began circulating on social media, encouraging \"white citizens of Charleroi\" to \"take up arms\". Charleroi Borough manager Joe Manning says Donald Trump's comments inflamed local tensions. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"It started to scare the hell out of everybody,\" Mr Manning said. \"You felt frightened for the Haitians that were here, because they're not bothering anybody.\" Charleroi was once such a boom town, it was nicknamed \"Magic City\".  But most of the factories and steel mills that powered the local economy have now closed, helping to push out two-thirds of the population over the course of a century. One of the largest remaining employers, a glass manufacturer, is leaving Charleroi and taking hundreds of jobs with it. The impending closure of a local glass factory, which employs hundreds of people in Charleroi, is another big blow for the town. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) In recent years, about 700 Haitian migrants have moved into the town. They include Evency Dorzelma, a former Haitian police officer who fled the country's gang violence six years ago. When he first arrived in Charleroi, he found a \"ghost town with hundreds of empty houses\", he said. \"What we brought to this city is really significant,\" Mr Dorzelma, who now works as a driver, said. Haitians and other migrants \"are filling jobs that most Americans would never do\" and revitalising the economy. Some have opened stores in formerly dilapidated downtown buildings. Some are working in aged care. Many others work at a food-packaging plant, where the company president told local TV he had struggled to find American workers. Evency Dorzelma says Haitian migrants have rejuvenated the economy in what was a \"ghost town\". (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"I'm wondering if the former president realises how valuable the support we bring to this community is,\" Mr Dorzelma said.  He fears Trump's rhetoric is dangerous to Haitians and other people of colour. \"I know a lot of Black Americans around here who are business owners, so we imagine, if this doesn't stop, anyone can get hurt,\" he said.  As with most things in America, residents in Charleroi are divided on the immigration issue, and what Trump has said about it. But in the town's front yards, Trump-Vance signs appear to be much more popular than those for the Harris-Walz ticket. Most of the locals who spoke to the ABC did not want to be identified in this story. \"There's just too much hate going on,\" one said.  But they frequently raised two complaints.  One was that the influx of new arrivals had resulted in problems for local schools, with too few translators and teachers to cope. The other was that misunderstandings about road rules and dangerous driving had led to frequent car accidents and near misses. Like much of America's rust belt, the \"Magic City\" of Charleroi has seen tough times. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Local officials concede there are challenges, but push back on both complaints. While the school district has had to hire English teachers to help 225 non-native speakers (up from 12 just five years ago), superintendent Ed Zelich insists it isn't struggling. And Mr Manning, the council manager, said traffic data showed accidents had decreased in recent years.  \"They're not any greater, or any more severe, because Haitians came here,\" he said.  Conservative social media accounts have amplified another theory: that \"Kamala has imported\" Haitians to provide cheap labour for the local food-packaging plant. A Republican state senator, Camera Bartolotta, responded online to say that was untrue and the plant's owner had been \"vilified wrongly\". \"He advertised and looked for workers for a long time,\" she wrote on X. \"Before shutting down completely, he hired an agency that connected immigrants who were vetted and LEGAL to work in his facility.\" Last week, however, local media reported an agency that provides staff for the plant has been accused by federal investigators of recruiting undocumented migrants and paying them with cash. The food-packaging company, Fourth Street Foods, did not respond to an inquiry from the ABC, but owner Dave Barbe told a local TV station his contracts with labour agencies require they only hire migrants with legal status. Opinion polls suggest Trump's heavy focus on immigration could be working for him.  Voters consistently rate it a top election issue, including in Pennsylvania — one of seven crucial swing states which are likely to decide the election.  Many of Charleroi's downtown shops are now empty. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) In a Washington Post poll last month, for example, 48 per cent of respondents in Pennsylvania rated immigration as \"extremely important\". And 52 per cent of Pennsylvania voters said Trump would do a better job on immigration, compared to 39 per cent for Harris. (That same poll found Harris just slightly ahead of Trump in the state overall.) Kevin Armstrong, whose Charleroi home is decorated with flags promoting Trump and disparaging Joe Biden, said many locals felt the town's Haitian migrants \"live better than us and rub it in our face\".  Haitians, along with Cubans, granted entry to the US are eligible for cash assistance through a resettlement program, which undocumented migrants from other places generally cannot access unless they are granted refugee or asylum-seeker status.  \"I'm 59 years old, I've worked my entire life and they live better than me,\" Mr Armstrong said. \"They're reaping my benefits. They're reaping my dad's benefits.\" Kevin Armstrong feels migrants are getting too much government support while too many Americans struggle. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"I don't care what Trump says, they ain't causing problems, and they are legal,\" said one local, who said he worked with many Haitian migrants. \"You look at where they are coming from, the history of Haiti. They don't want no problems, they want peace.\" Another woman, a restaurant worker, said she believed racism was the real problem. \"I personally have no problem with them,\" she said.  \"They come in here sometimes and they are very, very kind. \"But a lot of people don't feel that way and they were gunning for them the instant they were here.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Immigration Topic:Foreign Affairs Discrimination Immigration Immigration Policy US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

His family history is rooted in tragedy; assassinations, plane crashes, overdoses, accidental drownings, and a skiing accident have claimed the lives of 15 members of the Kennedy tree.  Not even his mother's hamsters would escape \"the Kennedy curse\" — the patriarch hamster of Caroline Kennedy once ate all of its children, White House housekeeper Anne Lincoln recounted.  But that doesn't mean he's unlucky. Caroline Kennedy and her brother John F Kennedy Jr, photographed in 1988.\n\n\n  (Reuters: Jim Bourg) In fact, it's quite the opposite.  The Kennedys have long stood as one of the most storied, recognisable and long-living political dynasties in America.  From US senators and attorneys-general to first lady and president of the United States — the descendants of Joseph P Kennedy Sr and his wife Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy had become synonymous with American public service.  \"Ambition, wealth, compassion, power, sex, love, and death,\" began an analysis by Washington Post journalist David Von Drehle in 1998, just two days after John F. Kennedy Jr and his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy died in a plane crash. \"If America had a Shakespeare, he would write the Kennedy story,\" he said.  And whether he likes it or not, Jack Schlossberg is the heir.  He's the son of the current US Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy — JFK's only surviving child — and designer Edwin Schlossberg. That also makes him cousin to Democrat-turned independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who earlier in the year made comments that a worm \"ate a portion\" of his brain, before suspending his US presidential campaign and throwing his support behind Republican candidate Donald Trump. John F Kennedy Jr was flying the light aircraft that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, also killing his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (right). \n  (AP: Mitch Jacobson) At first glance, some may recognise Mr Schlossberg from his self-credited \"goofy\" online persona, where his viral TikTok videos amass millions of likes (and recently landed him in The Hollywood Reporter's inaugural top 50 list of the most influential influencers).  For others, it may be due to his striking resemblance to his uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, who died at just 38 years old.  And even more eyes have been on the 31-year-old recently as he spent the last few months on the Harris-Walz campaign train in the lead up to November's election. In August he spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, drawing parallels between JFK and US Vice-President Kamala Harris. \"President John F Kennedy is my grandfather and he's my hero,\" Mr Schlossberg opened his speech with. \"Once again the torch has been passed to a new generation.\" In June, Mr Schlossberg announced — while posing on a pile of his own head shots — his new role as Vogue’s political correspondent. \"Jack [Schlossberg] is exactly how you should nepo baby,\" reads the top comment on his Instagram post with Vogue.  While many fans are quick to come to his defence, others have argued both his popularity and his resume fall to his decorated family tree.  \"One day people will not be able to get a job just because they're a Kennedy,\" said a user on X. Mr Schlossberg attending the Harris-Walz 'Fighting for Reproductive Freedom' bus tour at a university in  Pennsylvania.\n\n\n  (Reuters: Hannah Beier) Nepotism — or \"nepo babies\" as they have become affectionately called — is defined by the Macquarie Dictionary as \"patronage bestowed in consideration of family relationship and not on merit\". But can we really blame rising politicians for coming from a famous family? And is Jack Schlossberg a nepo baby?  Mr Schlossberg's appearance at the DNC sparked an online frenzy, with users quick claim him as the internet's new darling.  \"Bringing a book to the DNC in hopes that Jack Schlossberg spots me in the crowd,\" one user wrote on social media platform X. His popularity is no surprise, says comparative politics researcher at the University of Sydney James Loxton, despite the fact Mr Schlossberg may not be running for governor or senator (at least, for now). President John F Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. (AP: Bob Schutz) Dr Loxton says that in an age in which so-called \"nepo babies\" are being \"called out for their unfair advantages\", people around the world \"continue to throw their support to those with blood or marital ties to the powerful\".  \"It's just part and parcel of democracy,\" he said.  Presidential Studies Professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Centre Barbara A Perry said name recognition could often serve as a \"winning factor\" in democracies. \"Succeeding [Kennedy] generations have likewise used their wealth, status, celebrity, and ambition to achieve success in their chosen fields,\" she said.  \"The Kennedy name has served most of them well.\"  The term \"nepo baby\" may have been recently coined, but being groomed for greatness has been rooted in the history of American presidential politics since the dawn of time. The Massachusetts Adams family; the Roosevelts of New York; the Bush clan; Donald Trump and Ivanka and the Kushners.  The list goes on.  But the children who are born into powerful American dynasties are often forced to fall in line or get left behind — at least that was the Kennedy way, says author and Kennedy family expert Kate Clifford Larson.  \"It stems from Joseph F Kennedy Sr, and Rose Kennedy, who both came from political families and wanted to carry that forward for their kids,\" she says.  \"It was always rooted in the community life, advancement and power and their kids absorbed it.\"  Dr Perry agreed, recalling the story of meeting Mr Schlossberg two years ago at a John F Kennedy Presidential Library event, witnessing an elderly lady asking him if he was going to run for office some day.  \"I'm sure he has to field that question frequently,\" she said.  \"It also seems that his family might be grooming him for public life because, as the only grandson of JFK and the primary family member of his generation, he seems to pick up the mantle as it relates to his grandfather, president Kennedy.\" \"I had a couple of conversations with him and found Jack to possess all the positive traits of his family: he's handsome, witty, charming, charismatic, bright, and caring,\" Dr Perry said.  \"I also saw his grandfather in person and would compare them favourably.\" But is it truly a privilege to come from a political dynasty, or is it a (Kennedy) curse?  Ms Larson admits that children of political families carry privilege that many will never see in their lifetime — and Mr Schlossberg falls front and centre.  \"[Schlossberg] has access to resources and to people in power that the average American does not have,\" she said.  But it's what he chooses to do with that privilege and that power, and whether is he \"willing to carry that mantle\". The Kennedy clan always portrayed an \"All-American\" image, Mrs Larson said. (John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum: Cecil Stoughton, White House Photographs) \"Following in the footsteps of all those ancestors and relatives is a lot on these young people who have grown up in an entirely different world,\" she says.  \"[Mr Schlossberg] has a lot more to bear than the other children who have come down [the Kennedy line] and may be involved in politics. \"I can imagine [he] feels the weight of the world on him.\"  Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy pictured with her father, JFK. (Supplied: JFK Presidential Library) Dr Perry says that there is no beating around the bush —  it is a privilege to hail from a political dynasty as it opens doors to the top educational institutions and jobs.  \"But it can be a curse if the dynasty begins to lose its lustre in the American mind, however,\" she said.  According to the New York Times, the sons of governors are 6,000 times more likely than the average American to become governors themselves and the sons of senators are 8,500 times more likely to become senators, based on study from the journalist.  But that's just the United States.  As of June 2024, 11 of the world's democracies have heads of governments who are either the child — or in one case the wife — of a former head of government (either prime minister or president) according to a study in hereditary democracy by Dr Loxton.  Former US presidents George W Bush (left) and his father George HW Bush are of two father-son presidents in American political history.  (Reuters: Larry Downing) These include Canada, Estonia, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Mauritius, Nauru, the Philippines, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, and Uruguay.  And this happens \"all the time\", says Dr Loxton, from Justin Trudeau to the recently ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. The Kennedy family matriarch has been remembered by US leaders as an \"American icon\". \"By my count, if you look at every country at the world that has been a democracy since World War II, about 40 per cent of them, at some point, elected the child, the spouse, or the sibling of a former head of government,\" he said.  We even see it in Australia — three former state premiers (Queensland's Campbell Newman, Tasmania's Will Hodgman and New South Wales' Mike Baird) have parents who were federal or state ministers.  And former Labor politician Kim Beazley, who once served as deputy prime minister, is the son of Whitlam government minister Kim Beazley Sr. \"Wherever elections are held, dynasties emerge,\" said Dr Loxton. There is no denying that descendants of successful politicians arguably have a leg up because of name recognition, Ms Larson says.  \"But they still have to convince voters.\"  And when it comes down to the voters, hereditary democracy can often undermine the democratic process, says Dr Loxton.  \"It has a similar flavour to nepotism, and yet it is not quite the same as having the CEO of the company making his son the job,\" he said.  \"Because, with hereditary democracy, it's us. It's we the voters who have to elect these people.\" He said it's \"bizarre\" but that's \"what we do as voters\" all over the world.  Dr Perry argued that a case could be made against dynastic political families in a democratic-republic. But on the other hand, she said, \"such a bar to political candidates would have denied [us] presidents John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin Roosevelt, and George W Bush, so we shouldn't prevent multiple generations of families to hold power\". Instead, we should \"make sure that they are meritorious and not simply cashing in on their families' fame and fortune\". But when it comes to Mr Schlossberg? \"There is just something about him,\" Ms Larson said.  \"The president, his image, Jackie Kennedy, those descendants.\" ABC Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Once top Trump adviser, now podcaster Steve Bannon was in his element. The United States Capitol building was lit up behind him, there was a chill in the air, and Bannon was kicking off what would wind up being an eight hour election-night broadcast. He sat at the centre of a panel of guests from what he called the \"alternative conservative media\". He had a panel, maps, an election data guy and everything. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon fronts an election night broadcast of his show War Room on the night of the 2020 election.  Around 100 of Donald Trump's supporters were there on the rooftop with him, ready for a big night of partying. Bannon's show had all the elements of an election night broadcast. But it was a lot stranger than that. In fact, on that same rooftop there were four different broadcasts happening at the same time. There was Bannon's show, there was another right wing TV network, a right-wing radio network, and a dissident Chinese broadcaster, GNews and GTV. GNews and GTV were part of a massive billion dollar fraud being run by an exiled Chinese friend of Steve Bannon. They weren't legitimate news organisations as much as a way to get money out of Chinese expats. But even if your news organisation is an investment scam, covering an election takes planning. On October 31, 2020, the weekend before the election, Bannon met with staff from the Chinese outlets to explain how the election night would play out. The audio of that meeting was leaked to the news outlet Mother Jones in 2022. In it, Bannon told his broadcast partners that Trump would declare victory, early in the night. \"He's gonna declare victory. But that doesn't mean he's a winner.\" Bannon knew something that would be key to Trump's election denial-strategy: a basic piece of political science called the 'blue shift'. Basically, when vote counting begins on election night, things initially look very good for Republicans like Donald Trump, but then, as the night goes on, results shift towards the Democrats. It happens because Republicans are clustered in small towns, which report results faster. In that Halloween meeting, Bannon explained to his associates how this quirk in the electoral system would be used by Donald Trump to make people question the election results. \"They're going to have a natural disadvantage and Trump's going to take advantage of that.\" So, according to Bannon, on election night Donald Trump would declare victory before the Blue Shift happened. Before Democratic party votes in big cities and mail-in ballots are tallied and added to the vote counts. \"That's our strategy — he's going to declare himself a winner, so when you wake up Wednesday morning it's going to be a firestorm.\" And he went further than that. \"If Trump is losing by 10 or 11 o'clock at night, it's going to be even crazier,\" Bannon said. \"He's going to sit right there and say they stole it. \"If Biden's winnin', Trump is going to do some crazy shit.\" And of course, three days later, election night played out as Bannon had said. Donald Trump fronted television cameras and, far from conceding defeat, called the election result a \"fraud on the American public\". \"This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election,\" he said. \"Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election.\" On election night 2020 the world watched on as president Donald Trump refused to concede. (AP: John Locher) Earlier this month, more details of Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election were revealed when a 165-page court filing was unsealed. The filing cites previously unknown accounts by the former president's closest aides, and alleges that Trump \"laid the groundwork\" for rejecting the election results before the contest was over. He allegedly told advisers in the event he held an early lead, he would \"declare victory before the ballots were counted and any winner was projected\". In 2020, the plan to deny the presidential election result didn't get much more complex than what Steve Bannon outlined in that leaked Halloween planning meeting. Over the months that followed, Donald Trump and his allies tried to improvise their way to victory in an election they knew they had lost. You can trace the theories and strategies they used in the talking points amplified on Steve Bannon's podcast. Key to denying the legitimacy of the result itself was a conspiracy theory espoused by retired Air Force General Thomas McInerney. \"The Hammer is a surveillance tool … that the Obama administration, two weeks after they took over, put it into another location and started using it politically against their enemies, and then they modified it with this software package that changes the votes … the software package is called Scorecard.\" The Hammer and Scorecard. A government-run supercomputer and a secretive piece of software. Together they were supposedly used to flip votes in real time on election night, from red Trump votes to blue Biden ones. The 'Hammer and Scorecard’ conspiracy theory that took off after the 2020 election all starts with a man who has a long history of fooling the US government. In the days after the election, this is the theory that spread through the MAGA media ecosystem that Steve Bannon was part of. It became the 'big lie' underpinning a widespread push to deny the election result. The Hammer and Scorecard lie was one that fit in well with the reality of the 'blue shift'. None of it was true. Not only did Democrats not hack the election, there's no evidence that the Hammer and Scorecard exist. Things have not turned out well for anyone involved in pushing the Hammer and Scorecard theory. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon is due to get out of jail the week before the election this November. (AP: Alex Brandon, file) Steve Bannon is in jail for contempt of congress, awaiting release five days before the election. Bannon's Chinese business partner is in jail for fraud. His Chinese news network, which was part of that fraud, is gone. But that's the case with all the theories used to deny the 2020 election result. None of the theories about election fraud have been proven true, but that doesn't really matter. Millions believe it. The danger of this misinformation was evident when thousands of Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021, looking to stop what they saw as fraudulent certification of the election result. A mob of supporters of US president Donald Trump storm the US Capitol Building in Washington DC on January 6, 2021. (Reuters: Leah Millis) Almost 70 per cent of Republicans now say they believe the election was stolen. Many of Donald Trump's supporters have spent the last four years believing this, and it's played a key part in his bid to win back the White House. Denial of the 2020 election result has factored heavily into Donald Trump's 2024 campaign for the presidency. In a frequent cry at his political rallies he implores his supporters to make the result this November \"too big to rig\" — the implication being that the slim 2020 loss in key swing states was the result of fraud. It shows the tightrope Donald Trump must walk to get his MAGA supporters to cast a ballot. People who believe the 2020 vote was \"rigged\" need a reason to bother trying again. Donald Trump often rouses crowds with chants of 'too big to rig' at rallies. (Reuters: Tom Brenner) Donald Trump has confused the matter in recent months, angering some supporters by saying in interviews and at rallies that he \"lost by a whisker\". But in his September debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris he walked the comment back, claiming it was said with sarcasm. And in a rally this month in the swing state of Michigan, Trump was back to repeating false claims that he had won the 2020 election. \"We have to be too big to rig, you know that … turn out and vote in record numbers. \"You know, last time, last election, we did great in 2016, a lot of people don't know, we did much better in 2020. \"We won. We won. We did win. It was a rigged election. It was a rigged election.\" \"You have to tell Kamala Harris, that's why I'm doing it again. If I thought I'd lost, I wouldn't be doing this again.\" In 2022 retired judge J. Michael Luttig gave evidence to US Congress about the events of January 6. Michael Luttig, seated next to Greg Jacob, testifies at the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.  (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) He told the committee that Donald Trump and his allies are a clear and present danger to American democracy. \"That's not because of what happened on January 6th,\" Judge Luttig said. \"It's because to this very day, the former president, his allies and supporters pledged that in the presidential election of 2024, if the former president … were to lose that election, that they would attempt to overturn [it] in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020.\" Judge Luttig said the former president and his allies were executing their blueprint for 2024 \"in open and plain view of the American public\". That blueprint draws heavily on the failed attempt to deny the 2020 election result. But while the denial of that election was orchestrated on the fly, Donald Trump's response to a close loss this time will benefit from four years of planning from his team and his supporters. Donald Trump's campaign sells merchandise featuring his mug shot. (Reuters: Alyssa Pointer) Many who believe the 2020 election was \"stolen\" by Trump's opponents have themselves become involved in the political system, seeking local roles that involve certifying the election result. Given the rhetoric of his campaign, it's unlikely a close result will see Donald Trump concede on election night. And if Donald Trump wins the election fair and square, we'll hear a lot more about the stolen 2020 election, not less, as he uses the office of the president to make sure nothing like that ever happens again.

(Reuters: Marco Bello) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a declaration this week at a Fox News town hall on women's issues. \"We really are the party for IVF,\" Trump said. \"We want fertilisation that is all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we're out there on IVF, even more than them.\" Trump was speaking about the medical procedure of in vitro fertilisation, and responded to concerns from women at the town hall about the Republican party's support for its practice. \"I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question,\" he said. The question was from a mother of three, who said she was concerned about recent abortion bans in the US and whether that would stretch to IVF and other reproductive procedures. Trump said he had spoken to local representative Katie Britt about concerns around IVF, but insisted they were not valid. \"She called me up like 'emergency, emergency' because an Alabama judge had ruled that the IVF clinics were illegal and they have to be closed down,\" he said. IVF was not made illegal due to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February. Instead, the court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. \"And I said, explain IVF, very IVF, very quickly. And within about 2 minutes, I understood it,\" Trump said. Two events have ignited a debate over IVF in recent months. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court handed down a decision in a unique case that resulted in at least three fertility clinics pausing IVF services. The case was centred around three couples who had their frozen embryos destroyed when a patient at an Alabama clinic gained access to its cryopreservation unit and dropped a number of them on the ground. The couples sued the clinic for wrongful death, and the Alabama Supreme Court ultimately ruled with the plaintiffs. In its judgement, the Supreme Court said frozen embryos have the same rights as children. The clinic appealed the judgement to the US Supreme Court but was unsuccessful earlier this month. The ruling cast doubt on how to legally store, transport and use embryos, prompting some IVF patients to consider moving their frozen embryos out of the state. IVF providers in Alabama also suspended treatment until further notice. Months after the Alabama decision, more than 10,000 delegates gathered in Indianapolis for the annual meeting of Southern Baptists in June. Described by The New York Times as a \"barometer of evangelical sentiment\", the group voted to oppose the use of IVF. It did not ban the practice for its members, but called for: According to the Pew Research Centre, evangelicals are a strong voter base for the Republican party and the motion resulted in a letter being sent to Congress asking them to consider pro-life policies in May. Experts said the conservatives' view on IVF remained muddied by different posturing comments on the subject from both Trump and other representatives. The IVF debate comes after the US Supreme Court in 2020 overturned Roe v Wade — a landmark ruling in 1973 that recognised Americans' right to abortion and legalised it across the nation. It meant individual states could now decide if abortion was legal. At least 13 states in America have banned abortion for all stages of pregnancy, while another four states have banned abortion after six weeks. Another four states have banned abortion after six weeks, which is before many women are aware they are pregnant. Before Trump declared he was the \"father of IVF\", Senate Republicans had twice blocked legislation from the Democrats that would federally protect access to IVF. Flinders University's Prudence Flower, who specialises in US politics and the anti-abortion movement, said the Republican party had a complex relationship with IVF. She said unlike abortion, IVF had huge levels of popular support across partisan lines. According to a survey by Pew Research Centre, 70 per cent of adults said IVF access was a good thing. \"But for people who oppose abortion, IVF is problematic because the IVF process involves the creation of, often a large number of embryos, only one or two of which might end up being implanted,\" she said. \"So they view that as the destruction of human life. This kind of tension hadn't really come to light until Roe was overturned.\" When a hospital patient wandered into a US fertility clinic in 2020, they caused a chain of events that led to a major court ruling this week. It's left the IVF sector reeling, and patients in limbo. Dr Flowers said the aftermath of Roe v Wade created a renewed push for \"foetal personhood\" laws, which give legal rights of a person to foetuses and, in the Alabama Supreme Court case, embryos. These laws exist in more than a third of states in America. Dr Flower said Trump has been fairly consistent with his messaging around IVF access. \"When the Alabama Supreme Court found that embryos had rights, he disavowed that, and he said that the Republican Party strongly supported IVF,\" she said. Dr Flowers referenced US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's opinion after Roe v Wade was overturned. The Justice outlined that the court should reconsider rulings from past cases that gave rise to rights including access to contraception and marriage equality. \"The court outlined the right to privacy in this way, within the 1965 Griswold v Connecticut case, which found that married people have a right to access contraception,\" Dr Flowers said. \"So privacy rights have always been strongly tied, first to contraception, then to abortion rights, and then eventually, in the 2000s, to same-sex privacy within the home.\" There was a faction of conservative Republican and right-to-life activists, according to Dr Flowers, that argued popular forms of contraception were abortifacient, which means a drug that induces abortion. \"Anti-abortion activists have always claimed that the contraceptive pill and the IUD, some also argue the morning after pill, that those are all forms of abortion and should also be banned,\" she said. \"So there's this kind of real blurring for a subset of conservative Republicans around what they're willing to encompass in this kind of anti-abortion worldview.\" Australian National University's Wesley Widmaier, who is a US politics expert, said the former president had positioned himself as a \"paternalistic protector\" of women. \"It's a very traditional gender role where Trump and the GOP are less forthright in protecting women's rights and expanding women's rights,\" he said. \"I mean, he said 'father of IVF', and it's right there. He's the father. He's the protector. But he's not someone who is enabling or supporting women to kind of exercise their own freedom of choice and liberty and those kinds of things.\" Dr Flowers said she had concerns over how that could change if he were elected, despite Trump's consistent messaging around his support of IVF. \"If Republicans pass a bill banning IVF on religious grounds or banning federal support for IVF on religious grounds or various other things, who knows how he would interpret that,\" she said. \"He might again just say that ultimately, it's a matter for the states, and completely wash his hands of it. \"So I think there are interesting, disturbing tensions emerging amongst particularly conservative Republicans.\" Trump's campaign later described his \"father of IVF\" comment as a joke. \"It was a joke President Trump made in jest when he was enthusiastically answering a question about IVF, as he strongly supports widespread access to fertility treatments for women and families,\" spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.

The Republican nominee spoke to voters and answered reporters through a drive-through window. The American public will head to the polls in just over a fortnight to elect the next US president. Donald Trump has taken his US presidential election campaign to a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, where he served fries to voters and answered questions from reporters through a drive-through window. An employee at the fast food restaurant in Feasterville-Trevose, in Philadelphia's north-eastern suburbs, showed the Republican nominee how to dunk baskets of fries into oil before he helped fill takeaway bags for customers. The Republican presidential nominee spoke to voters and delivered takeaway orders to customers at a drive-through window. (AP: Evan Vucci) \"It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,\" Trump said during the appearance. \"I do appreciate it a little more. You say, 'give me French fries', I'll never forget this experience.\" The store's owner, Derek Giacomantonio, told reporters he accepted Trump's request to visit because he wanted to show the \"transformative working experience that one in eight Americans have had: a job at McDonald's\". The store's owner accepted Trump's request to visit so he could demonstrate the working experience of his staff. (AP: Doug Mills/The New York Times) \"It is a fundamental value of my organisation that we proudly open our doors to everyone who visits the Feasterville community,\" he said. Local police closed the busy streets around the McDonald's — which CNN reported was closed for the event — as crowds gathered, passing motorists honked their horns and Trump supporters waved flags, held signs and took pictures. Large crowds of Trump supporters and local residents gathered outside the store to wave flags, hold signs and take photos of the former president. (AP: Evan Vucci) The visit came as Trump stepped up his criticism of Kamala Harris and dug into his claim — spread without offering evidence — that she never worked at the fast-food chain while in college, despite saying so during her campaign. It's the latest example of the former president's longtime strategy of questioning the credentials of his political opponents by promoting baseless claims. Trump worked with McDonald's employees during the store visit and said it \"requires great expertise\" to serve fries. (AP: Doug Mills/The New York Times) Ms Harris says her experience working for McDonald's shows she understands working-class struggles. \"Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family,\" she said in an interview last month. Trump also held an impromptu press conference with reporters through the McDonald's drive-through window. (AP: Evan Vucci) The Democratic nominee spent Sunday celebrating her 60th birthday by meeting with Black voters in another election battleground state, Georgia. Supporters at a Baptist church near Atlanta serenaded Ms Harris with a Happy Birthday song before she delivered a speech urging Americans to vote and \"shine the light in moments of darkness\".

(AP: Sean Simmers) Billionaire Elon Musk is handing out $US1 million cheques to people who sign an online petition in support the US Constitution. Mr Musk's America PAC organisation uses participants' details to try and influence them into voting for Donald Trump in next month's election. Legal concerns have been raised about whether the money breaches US laws that ban paying people with the intention of getting them to register to vote. Elon Musk says he will give away $US1 million ($1.4 million) a day from now until next month's US election, with the cash to go to people who sign his online petition in support of the first and second amendments in the US Constitution. Those amendments protect American citizens' right to freedom of speech and to bear arms legally. The Tesla and SpaceX co-founder gave away the first million-dollar cheque on Saturday to an attendee of his America PAC event in Pennsylvania, aimed at rallying supporters behind presidential candidate Donald Trump, in a move that has raised questions over the legality of the payments. Attendees of an event hosted by Mr Musk on Saturday had to sign the petition, allowing America PAC to gather their contact details for more potential voters that it can work to get to the polls for Trump. The man announced as the first winner was John Dreher, who Mr Musk says was unaware he was going to be given the payout. Mr Musk's America PAC organisation uses participants' details to try and influence Americans to register to vote. (Reuters: Rachel Wisniewski) The billionaire created America PAC as a political action organisation in support of Trump's presidential campaign to help mobilise and register voters in battleground states. Election law experts have now voiced concerns that Mr Musk could be breaching federal laws that ban the payment of cash to people with the intention of getting them to register to vote or to vote in a particular way. The laws cover not only cash payments, but also anything of monetary value like liquor or lottery chances, according to a US Justice Department election-crimes manual. Mr Musk has become a vocal supporter of former US president Donald Trump in his bid to be re-elected. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) Rick Hasen, a political science professor with UCLA's Law School, says Mr Musk would not be breaking any laws if he were only offering money for people to sign his petition. \"The problem is that the only people eligible to participate in this giveaway are the people who are registered to vote. And that makes it illegal,\" Professor Hasen said. Mr Musk has been ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person and has already contributed at least $US75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump's bid to regain the White House.

You’re the worst vice president. Kamala, you’re fired. Get the hell out of here.” — Donald Trump, speaking at campaign rally at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.  Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris said Donald Trump \"demeans\" the office of the presidency, after the Republican nominee referred to her as a \"s*** vice president\" during a rally in Pennsylvania.  During the rally Mr Trump also told the crowd to tell Ms Harris, \"you've had enough\", before allowing rally-goers to scream profanities about the vice president.  Ms Harris later responded to the incident in an interview with Reverend Al Sharpton on MSNBC, saying Mr Trump \"should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States\".  \"He has not earned the right,\" she said. \"He's not earned the right, and that's why he's going to lose.  \"The president of the United States must set a standard, not only for our nation,  but ... for the world.  \"And what you see in my opponent, a former president ... it demeans the office.\"  Touching down in Philadelphia, before he headed to McDonald's for his shift, Mr Trump was asked about his phone call with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu.  Mr Trump said the pair spoke about a drone strike Israeli authorities say was directed toward Mr Netanyahu's home.  \"He told me that he was attacked at his village where he lives, a vacation area, and that he was attacked, but he was fine,\" Mr Trump told media on the tarmac. Asked whether he believed Israel should attack Iran over the strike, Mr Trump said he told the Israeli leader: \"You do what you have to do.\"  Kamala Harris was surprised on her 60th birthday by campaign staff on Air Force Two before departing Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. (Reuters: Jacquelyn Martin/Pool ) Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday on the campaign trail, surprised with a cake, cards and decorations by staff as she boarded Air Force Two.  She later visited two churches in Atlanta, Georgia as part of a nationwide push known as \"souls to the polls\" — joined by singer Stevie Wonder at one service, held at Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro.  Wonder led the crowd in singing Happy Birthday to the vice president, who appeared to choke up towards the end of the performance.  Ms Harris later said that she “had to check off a whole big one” on her bucket list because of the birthday song from Wonder, which prompted the singer to spring up and lead the congregation in a quick verse of ”Higher Ground.\" The Pew Research Centre has found voters don't believe Donald Trump will publicly acknowledge Kamala Harris as the winner if he loses the upcoming election.   The research organisation surveyed 5,110 adults between September 30 and October 6.  Almost all of Ms Harris's supporters (95 per cent) and about half of Trump supporters surveyed (48 per cent) believe Ms Harris will concede and accept the result.  Comparatively, only 4 per cent of Ms Harris's supporters surveyed expect Trump to acknowledge a Harris win, while 46 per cent of Trump supporters do.  ABC/AP Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Israel US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In Tuesday's wrap, we take a look at rising political violence, Donald Trump's North Carolina appearance, and new controversy involving the Central Park Five.  Let's get into it. The charged atmosphere in the lead up to election day is creating a “highly volatile” situation, experts say.  “It’s very clear that … Donald Trump is spiralling down, unhinged. What worries me about these comments, some of these are just so strange that they’re hard to imagine [but there] are dangerous ones in the middle of that. ‘The enemy from within’ and some of that.” — Tim Walz, appearing on The View talk show.  Recently in Pennsylvania, a man accosted a group of supporters rallying for Vice President Kamala Harris, punching a 74-year-old man in the head and calling another man a “n***** supporter” as he fled.  In Michigan, a man enraged by his hatred of Donald Trump used an all-terrain vehicle to run over an 81-year-old putting up a yard sign supporting the Republican nominee.  There have been at least 300 cases of political violence in the US since January 6, 2021, according to Reuters, with 51 of them occurring this year.  Americans are starting to see violence as “part of the way politics happens”, according to Nealin Parker, head of non-profit Common Ground USA. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Ms Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform. The five Black and Hispanic teenagers wrongfully convicted for the 1989 rape of a white jogger are suing Donald Trump for defamation. A new Netflix miniseries revives the controversy around Donald Trump's infamous death penalty ad during the 1989 \"Central Park Jogger\" case. The Central Park Five, who each spent between five and 13 years in prison before being cleared, say recent comments by Mr Trump \"intentionally inflicted emotional distress\". During the presidential debate on September 10, Mr Trump claimed the group had \"killed a person\" and admitted guilt. During the 1989 case, Mr Trump paid for a full-page ad in multiple newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. The group are now seeking unknown damages. \"[They] never pled guilty to any crime and were subsequently cleared of all wrongdoing,\" the lawsuit filing says. \"Further, the victims of the Central Park assaults were not killed.\" A spokesperson for the Trump campaign called the case \"just another frivolous, election interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists\". People react as Donald Trump attends a rally at Williams Arena in Greenville, North Carolina. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Donald Trump’s supporters started arriving at his Greenville, North Carolina rally as much as 10 hours ahead of his scheduled appearance.  North Carolina is one of the key battleground states.  “Under the Trump administration, we are going to take back what is ours,” Mr Trump said during his speech. “We will end the looting, ransacking, raping and pillaging of North Carolina and frankly every other state in the union.”  As election day nears, roughly eight in 10 voters are already locked in on their presidential pick, according to the Pew Research Centre.  The research organisation says a majority of voters surveyed say they're certain about their choice.  Another 8 per cent say they have a preference, but could change their mind, while 5 per cent have not picked but are leaning towards a candidate.

(Reuters: Rebecca Cook) Soujoud Hamade can't get the video of the burning man out of her head. \"It's a horrendous, horrific image that will be imprinted in my mind for the rest of my life,\" the Michigan lawyer said. Shaban al-Dalou was a day shy of his 20th birthday when he burned to death in his family's tent last week as a result of an Israeli strike near the Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza. Graphic video of the young man's final moments in the inferno, his writhing arm still attached to an IV drip, has gone around the world, a symbol of civilian suffering in Gaza. The US State Department has described the images as \"horrifying\" and \"deeply disturbing\". Israel said it was targeting a Hamas command centre. Soujoud Hamade considered herself a life-long Democrat, but is now voting for Jill Stein. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Until recently, Hamade, the president of the Michigan chapter of the National Arab American Bar Association, considered herself \"a life-long Democrat\". But the 32-year-old blames the Biden administration for its continued support of Israel and for not doing enough to end the killing of civilians. Shaban al-Dalou had posted videos on social media of life in Gaza. Earlier this week, vision of his brutal death was broadcast around the world. The death of al-Dalou feels like a final straw for Soujoud. \"I'm a first-generation American, that could have easily been me,\" she said. Soujoud said she would now be voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the presidential election. \"I mean, what more do you need to see?\" \"As-salaam 'alykum sister — please vote and vote for a third party,\" Farah Khan says as she presses a small flyer into the hand of a woman leaving Friday prayers in a mosque north of Detroit. \"We have to register our protest — we cannot be silent,\" she tells another woman. The woman studies the leaflet. \"I know,\" she says quietly. Khan is a Michigan co-chair of the Abandon Harris group, which sprang up last year in protest at the Biden administration's staunch support of Israel. Farah Khan is encouraging Michigan voters to support Jill Stein. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) The group, originally called Abandon Biden, is one of a number of organisations that formed ahead of the Democratic primaries earlier this year. They urged voters to lodge a protest by choosing the option of \"uncommitted\" on their ballot paper, rather than backing a candidate. More than 100,000 in the key swing state of Michigan did so, in the hope of pressuring the administration to do more to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. The reality on the ground in Gaza makes assessing the true death toll an enormous challenge, but despite that, experts say it is not only recorded honestly, but also likely an under-count.  In January of this year, in response to a case brought by South Africa, the International Court of Justice found Israel should take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza. It could take years for the court to issue a verdict on the substantial question of whether genocide is occurring, an allegation Israel calls \"baseless\". For the Abandon Harris campaign and many Arab Americans, there simply is no ambiguity. The movement is formally endorsing Stein for president. Lebanese flags are flown from a balcony in Dearborn. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) \"We want to punish this administration, the Harris Biden administration, for committing genocide, for abetting it, for funding it, for funnelling our money, our hard-earned tax money, and keep supplying weapons to kill innocent people,\" Khan said. Some Democrats blame Stein for robbing them of victory in the 2016 presidential election. In Michigan and another key swing state, Wisconsin, the Green Party candidate's total number of votes was greater than the margin by which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. This time, Democrats are taking no chances. A Gen-Z voter group backing Kamala Harris has branded Stein as a scammer, who's running a \"spoiler\" campaign. Jill Stein (centre) wants the US to stop supplying arms to Israel. (Reuters: Rebecca Cook) \"She's literally worse than Elizabeth Holmes, the Fyre Fest guys and Anna Delvey combined,\" one of their videos claims. The Democratic National Committee has also released an attack ad on Stein, in which the candidate's face slowly morphs into Trump. \"She's not sorry she helped Trump win. That's why a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump,\" it said. In response to the attack ads, Stein has said: \"Bring it on.\" \"It's wonderful, it's the best public relations campaign we could ask for,\" she told the ABC. The 74-year-old Harvard-educated doctor and activist is calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and has advocated for making US military aid to Israel dependent on an end to the violence. \"The US controls the weapons, the financing, the diplomatic cover and the intelligence,\" she said. \"So when the US says the war is over and the genocide is over, it's absolutely over.\" Protest signs are dotted around Dearborn. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Stein is one of several third-party candidates running and is also campaigning on issues including combating climate change and reducing income inequality. She says while she's \"not ruling out a win\", she hopes ultimately to shake up America's two-party system. Stein is polling nationally at about one per cent, but small shifts to a third-party candidate in key battlegrounds could make all the difference in who wins the White House in November. \"You know, most people are holding their nose,\" Stein said. \"They're voting against the candidate that they hate the most. \"Why don't we have more choices? That's what democracy is supposed to be about.\" Dearborn, which is on Detroit's outskirts, is America's first Arab-majority city and is like a little pocket of the Middle East in the US Midwest. Waves of migrants have come here over generations, many to work in the auto industry. Dearborn, Michigan, became the first Arab-majority city in the US in 2023. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Ford Motor Company's worldwide headquarters are located in Dearborn, and Henry Ford was said to favour Arab workers, finding them industrious and reliable. Today just over half of Dearborn's 110,000 residents are of Arabic descent. In 2020, they backed Joe Biden by a ratio of around three-to-one, helping him win the state and take the White House. But the Democrats can no longer rely on that support. While America's Democratic diehards enjoyed pep talks and pop music at their party-vibes convention this week, a smaller panel event on the sidelines was striking a very different tone. In the Sahara restaurant in downtown Dearborn, images of the destruction in Lebanon play on the television screen above the cash register. The establishment is doing a brisk lunchtime trade with police officers and a couple of tourists mingling among the regulars from the nearby Ford plant. Owner and manager Sam Hammoud is busy taking orders as well as making the food. He said he's found it difficult to sleep since Israel invaded southern Lebanon after a dramatic escalation in hostilities with Hezbollah. \"It's tearing us apart,\" he said. \"The bombing hit home. I'm talking about my village, my people, my cousins. \"My old man has been running all over the country trying to find a safe place to stay.\" Sam Hammoud runs a restaurant in Dearborn. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Hammoud voted for Trump in 2016 and again in the 2020 presidential elections, but this time he won't be backing the former president or Harris. \"This is two administrations that just want to pound, pound, pound bombs,\" he said. \"And they're all USA bombs, and I feel like I'm in this whole situation because they're using our tax dollars.\" He said he's considering not voting at all, or perhaps opting to cast his ballot in favour of Stein. \"I have not decided yet … I'm just waiting on somebody to stop the war.\" Democrat Noah Arbit knows the result in Michigan could come down to the wire. \"It's exceptionally close,\" he said. \"As much of a toss-up as anything could be.\" State politician Noah Arbit is the founder of the Michigan Democratic Jewish Caucus. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Arbit represents Michigan's 20th district, north-west of Detroit, in the state legislature. He acknowledges that concern about the handling of the war in Gaza \"has led to a significant erosion in support for Democrats\". The 29-year-old, who is Jewish, is also fielding concerns from some constituents about whether the administration is doing enough to combat rising anti-Semitism. \"My message to people is you can criticise the Israeli government, but you cannot come for the Jewish community,\" Arbit said. The real work, he said, is to \"find more votes in other places that we can compensate for any erosion, whether it's in the Arab community or other communities\". David Dulio, who is a professor of political science at Oakland University north of Detroit, said the Harris campaign is likely factoring in some losses in Michigan's Arab community and appears to be trying to offset them with outreach to other constituencies. David Dulio is a distinguished professor of political science at Michigan's Oakland University. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) \"If they can limit the damage and turn up the heat on the African American turnout, maybe that's enough,\" he said. \"But Trump is doing the same thing in other parts of the state, with other constituencies and in rural Michigan. \"I think both campaigns know Michigan is at or near the top of the list when it comes to priorities in these battleground states.\" Soujoud Hamade knows a vote for Stein could end up boosting Trump's chances, but she rejects the suggestion she will be essentially voting for the Republican candidate. \"It's an unfair characterisation,\" she said. \"I think that it's a vote for Jill Stein, it's not a vote for Trump. \"The Democrats shouldn't feel entitled to our vote.

(Reuters: Emily Elconin) A couple of decades have passed since rapper Eminem was dominating the music charts.  But in Detroit, in the American election battleground state of Michigan, he remains a hometown hero. \"As most of you know, the city of Detroit and the whole state of Michigan mean a lot to me,\" he told a political rally in the Midwestern city tonight. \"And going into this election, the spotlight is on us more than ever. And I think it's important to use your voice so I'm encouraging everybody to get out and vote please.\" Eminem, a long-time critic of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, was introducing former president Barack Obama at a rally for Kamala Harris on Tuesday, local time. He's the latest big name to try to give the Democratic candidate a tie-breaking boost as the election race enters its final fortnight with deadlocked polls. Other stars hitting the hustings for Ms Harris in the home stretch range from rocker Bruce Springsteen to the cast of White House drama The West Wing. The star power is being focused on the seven swing states likely to decide the election: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Emmy-winning actor Bradley Whitford, who played White House deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman in The West Wing, appeared at a rally with Mr Obama earlier on Tuesday.  Bradley Whitford, of The West Wing fame, worked the crowd at a Harris rally in Wisconsin. (Reuters: Joel Angel Juarez) \"I know you must be bored hearing some celebrity lubricant like me,\" Whitford said to laughs from the crowd in Wisconsin's state capital, Madison.  \"Sorry, that was weird… no, you don't need me to tell you what you already know – that this is the most important election of your lifetime.\" Fellow West Wing stars Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff, Dulé Hill and Mary McCormack joined Whitford at a campaign event in Milwaukee on Monday. Mr Obama will continue his star-studded swing-state tour with Bruce Springsteen in Georgia on Thursday and Pennsylvania on Monday.  Bruce Springsteen performed in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) \"The major event is part of a series of 'When We Vote We Win' concerts focused on driving enthusiasm and getting Pennsylvanians to vote early,\" the Harris campaign said of the latter concert. Springsteen also performed in support of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. He endorsed Ms Harris, and described Trump as \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime\", in a video posted to social media earlier this month.  Other big musical names to join Ms Harris on the trail in recent days include Lizzo and Usher, who campaigned for the vice-president in Michigan and Georgia respectively. Lizzo campaigned for Kamala Harris in Michigan. (AP: Jacquelyn Martin) The Harris campaign has also enjoyed backing from P!nk and Oprah Winfrey, who both appeared at the Democratic National Convention in August; Beyoncé, who allowed the use of her hit song Freedom at campaign rallies; and Taylor Swift, whose post-debate endorsement of Ms Harris prompted Trump to say the singer would \"probably pay a price\", and that he hated her. Trump's highest-profile celebrity backers include wrestler Hulk Hogan, musician Kid Rock and Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White, who all appeared at the Republican National Convention in July.  He has also won endorsement from some lauded Pennsylvania athletes, which could boost his support in that battleground state. Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, who played in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers, appeared at a Trump rally on Monday. Former NFL star Antonio Brown took the stage at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Billionaire businessman Elon Musk has also been campaigning for Trump, offering voters the chance to win $US1 million ($1.4 million) if they sign an online petition and provide their contact details to his pro-Trump political group. At a rally last month, Trump suggested Hollywood stars secretly voted for him despite publicly saying they didn't. \"A lot of people in Hollywood are blaming themselves for this… but they all vote for me,\" he told the rally in Arizona.  \"You know that? Because they want to pay low taxes. They talk about, 'No, we don’t like Trump', but when they go to vote…\"  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Michael Rowland Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Celebrities US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In Wednesday's wrap, we take a look at ramped up election security, Donald Trump's upcoming appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, and what Joe Biden's been up to this week. Let's get into it. Bulletproof vests, snipers, metal detectors and surveillance drones – election officials are ramping up security nationwide as voting day approaches. Maricopa County, in the critical battleground state of Arizona, will have intense security at its vote counting centre. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer told NBC law enforcement officials had \"spared no expense\" in 2022, and were going \"all in again\". \"Real strength is about taking responsibility for your actions. That's what I want in the president of the United States.\" — Barack Obama, during a Madison campaign rally.  Along with snipers on the roof and security at every entrance, the centre will also have security cameras, floodlights and two layers of security fencing. Other centres have told media they've set up emergency operations systems to monitor any kind of disturbance at the polling booth. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said officials were preparing for never-before-seen threats, including artificial intelligence. \"We have layers of security – we have military and law enforcement joining our team to protect our cyber support systems,\" she told NBC. \"We are definitely on top of it, and take all our security very seriously.\" Former president Donald Trump will be interviewed by Joe Rogan on his podcast later this week. The Joe Rogan Experience, with more than 14 million followers on Spotify and 17.5 million subscribers on YouTube, is one of the most popular podcasts in America.  It will be the Republican candidate's first time being interviewed by the comedian, who he has previously lashed out at.  It continues a trend by the Trump campaign to win young male voters. A YouGov poll last year found the majority of Rogan's listeners are male and under 35 years old. Mr Trump's interview with Rogan follows Vice-President Kamala Harris's recent appearance on another podcast popular among young voters, sitting down for an interview with Call Her Daddy.  US President Joe Biden visited the New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters in Concord for the first time since stepping down from the election race.  Speaking at the party headquarters, he said right now was a critical moment for the United States.  \"If Trump wins, this nation changes,\" he said.  He also spoke at the New Hampshire Technical Institute as part of the state visit, joined on stage by former presidential candidate and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.  Disbarred lawyer Rudy Giuliani must hand over his multi-million-dollar New York City apartment, a Mercedes Benz, about two dozen watches and multiple items of Yankees memorabilia to two Georgia election workers he defamed. Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, federal prosecutor and legal adviser to Donald Trump, is disbarred in New York, with a court finding he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. The former New York mayor and Trump lawyer has seven days to turn over the items to Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss.  A jury ruled Mr Giuliani owes them $US150 million for misinformation he spread after the 2020 election.  He falsely accused Ms Freeman and Ms Moss of illegal activity while counting ballots on election night, sharing video which Georgia election officials and investigators ruled showed them simply doing their jobs.  The video of them working became central to efforts to overturn Georgia election results.  Mr Giuliani is appealing the ruling, but the two women have been authorised by the judge to immediately begin selling the assets.  More than 7 in 10 American adults reported the future of the nation, the economy and the upcoming election as major sources of stress, according to the American Psychological Association. The group surveyed 3,305 adults for its 2024 Stress in America report. \"Stress related to the current election appeared to be driven, in part, by the potential consequences from the election results,\" the report said. Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to report stress related to the future of the US. Two in five surveyed said the state of the United States currently had \"made them consider moving to a different country\".

This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In Thursday's wrap, we take a look at the fresh surge in conspiracy theories and the complaint by Donald Trump against the UK Labour Party. Let's get into it. Voting machines reversing votes, more registered voters than people, and large numbers of non-citizens voting. These are the conspiracy theories US officials are fighting less than two weeks out from election day. \"I don't want to just win, I want to win by such a big margin that we're going to bed early on Tuesday night.\"  — JD Vance, during a Las Vegas campaign rally.  State and local election officials say they're being forced to spend their time debunking rumours and explaining how elections are run, while also trying to oversee early voting and prepare for November 5, local time. Utah's Lieutenant Governor Deirdre Henderson said it was like \"playing whack-a-mole with truth\". \"Truth is boring, facts are boring, and outrage is really interesting,\" she said. In Shelby County, Tennessee, county election officials said human error was to blame for reports of votes being changed. Voters had been using their fingers instead of a stylus to mark their selections on voting machines, officials said. The Trump campaign has filed a complaint against the UK's Labour Party, telling the US election watchdog they \"attempted to influence\" the election. The six-page complaint cited news reports detailing close ties between the UK's ruling party and Vice-President Kamala Harris's campaign. It also references a now-deleted LinkedIn post made by Labour's head of operations which said there were \"nearly 100 Labour Party staff\" ready to campaign for Ms Harris in swing states. \"This week marked the 243 anniversary of the surrender of British forces at the Battle of Yorktown,\" the complaint reads.  \"[It was] a military victory that ensured that the United States would be politically independent of Great Britain. It appears that the Labour Party and the Harris for President campaign have forgotten the message.\" Leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer has denied the accusations. (Reuters: Toby Melville) UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters Labour volunteers had \"gone over pretty much every election\". Other UK officials echoed his comment, noting the party's volunteers and staffers were allowed to \"do what they want to do in their own time\" at their own expense. KSHB reporter Ryan Gamboa was struck by a metal fragment during a sport shooting campaign event. (AP: Dominick Williams/The Kansas City Star) A Missouri journalist, Ryan Gamboa, was injured when a rifle fired by a Democrat candidate caused a metal fragment to hit him in the arm.  Lucas Kunce, a Marine, is trying to unseat Republican senator Josh Hawley.  Mr Kunce was firing AR-14-style rifle at targets at a Kansas City home, in what appears to be an a attempt to appeal to moderate and Republican voters.  His opponent, Mr Hawley, responded to the incident jokingly on social media: \"I condemn all acts of violence against reporters and call on Kunce never to shoot another one.\" More than a third of US adults believe artificial intelligence will be used \"mostly for bad\" during the presidential campaign, according to a Pew Research Centre study. The research organisation surveyed almost 10,000 adults for the report. A majority of US adults, it found, were also \"extremely or very concerned\" about people using AI to \"create and distribute fake or misleading information\" about candidates and campaigns.

(Reuters: Marco Bello) Donald Trump's former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, says he believes the ex-president meets the definition of a fascist, and would rule as a dictator if he could. Trump's rival in the presidential race, Kamala Harris, has described him as \"increasingly unhinged and unstable\". The election is on November 5 (local time). Donald Trump prefers the \"dictator approach\" to running a country, and openly wished he had \"Hitler's generals\" when he was US president, his former White House chief of staff says. John Kelly, who also served as Trump's secretary of homeland security, is using the final days of the election campaign to warn he believes his former boss is a fascist. He told the New York Times he believes Trump would govern like a dictator if he were allowed to. \"Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he's certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,\" Mr Kelly said. \"So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\" Mr Kelly spent six months as homeland security secretary after Trump took office in 2017. He moved into the White House role in July of that year and served until early 2019, when Trump says he was \"terminated\" for being in \"way over his head\". The retired US Marine Corps general publicly turned on Trump soon after leaving the role. He has previously accused Trump of calling fallen American service members \"suckers and losers\", and of repeatedly praising Hitler for doing \"some good things\". John Kelly served as Donald Trump's White House chief of staff. (Supplied: US Department of Homeland Security) The Trump campaign disputes Mr Kelly's claims. Spokesperson Stephen Cheung said in a statement: \"John Kelly has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his president well while working as chief of staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" In a separate interview with The Atlantic, Mr Kelly discussed a conversation in which he said Trump asked him: \"Why can't you be like the German generals?\" According to Mr Kelly's account, he then asked Trump: \"Do you mean the kaiser's generals? Surely you can't mean Hitler's generals?\" Trump replied, \"Yeah, yeah, Hitler's generals,\" Mr Kelly said. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris said the comments suggested Trump was \"increasingly unhinged and unstable\". \"Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States Constitution, he wants a military that will be loyal to him,\" she said. \"It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler.\" Other Trump administration officials and former members of his inner circle have levelled similar criticisms at Trump. Mark Milley, who was America's highest-ranking military officer under Trump, described him as \"fascist to the core\" and \"the most dangerous person to this country\" in a recently published book by journalist Bob Woodward. His former vice-president, Mike Pence, said Trump should \"never be president of the United States again\". And John Bolton, a national security adviser to Trump, has described him as unfit to be president, and said he would be consumed by retribution if re-elected. When asked in the past if he would rule as a dictator, Trump said he would be \"dictator for one day\".

(Supplied: Reuters, NewsCorp, Getty Images, Australian Story graphic) The Murdoch family brawl playing out in a courtroom in Reno, Nevada, has rattled investors in both Fox and News Corporations, and now the sharks are circling. It's a perilous moment for one of the world's most powerful media empires. The family is bitterly divided over the governance of the secret Murdoch Family Trust (MFT) which gives them control of Fox and News, and is facing a revolt from News Corp shareholders mounting a direct challenge to the mechanism by which the Murdochs run the empire. At the next annual meeting of News Corporation in a few weeks' time, investors will vote on a resolution to abolish the so-called dual-class share structure. As it stands, there are two classes of News Corp shares: voting shares and non-voting shares. Although the MFT only has a 14 per cent economic stake in News Corp, the family can control the company because it owns 41 per cent of the voting shares. The Background Briefing team brings you Murdoch's Endgame, a special three-part series that examines how the end of the powerful Murdoch dynasty could be closer than we think. Activist hedge fund Starboard Value, which has accumulated a substantial stake in News Corp over the past year and put forward the resolution, has proposed a one-share-one-vote system. Background Briefing has spoken to a number of institutional investors likely to vote in favour of the resolution. While the result is non-binding, a majority in favour would put the board, chaired by Lachlan Murdoch, under significant pressure to strike a deal with shareholders. A finance industry source told Background Briefing that News Corp, which opposes the Starboard resolution, is arguing to investors that if the resolution succeeded, a one-share-one-vote system could only be introduced by striking a deal between voting and non-voting shareholders. With founder Rupert Murdoch, who retired last year, now 93 years old, industry experts say the vote could mark the beginning of the end of the century-old Murdoch dynasty. Starboard Value points to the ongoing MFT dispute in its proxy resolution, and takes aim at Rupert's squabbling children. \"The situation at News Corp is a textbook example of one of the worst forms of a dual-class share structure — one that extends beyond any reasonable timeline and one in which super-voting rights are moving from a visionary founder to the founder's children,\" the resolution reads. \"The four Murdoch siblings with voting rights within the MFT are reported to have widely differing world views, which, collectively, could be paralyzing to the strategic direction of the Company. More importantly, we are not sure why their perspectives should carry greater weight than the views of other stockholders.\" Lachlan Murdoch turned 53 on Sunday, having won the crown to his family's media empire. Behind closed doors, his reign is being challenged. Background Briefing has reached out to News Corporation for comment, and has approached or spoken to a number of institutional investors, whose votes could sway the result. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, whose members include Australia's biggest super funds, has a long-standing position in favour of one-share-one-vote, and voted in favour of a similar resolution in 2015. Back then, it was supported by more than 90 per cent of non-Murdoch shareholders and 49.5 per cent of all voting shareholders — just short of success. News Corporation sign in New York (Supplied: Reuters) Another investor, Matt Williams, head of Australian equities at Airlie Funds Management — one of the largest holders of News Corp's voting shares with a 2 per cent stake — is also planning to back the resolution. \"Philosophically, we always support one share equals one vote,\" Mr Williams said. \"In terms of News Corp itself, I think Lachlan has been a very good chairman. I think the management team have done a great job of changing the business over the last 10 years. In a polarised media world, it's never been more important to understand Lachlan Murdoch. \"So, whilst philosophically we agree with the Starboard resolution and we'll probably vote for it because of that, I think the rhetoric around the resolution is somewhat overblown.\" Mr Williams acknowledged News Corp could simply ignore the non-binding resolution, but said if it was to secure majority shareholder support, it would \"definitely give those independent directors on the board of News Corp something to think about\". \"And I think it would have to promote a very healthy discussion at the board level,\" he said. If the Starboard resolution achieves majority shareholder support, there would be pressure on the Murdoch family to relinquish control. At the same time, there is a push from some investors to break up News Corp, and separate profitable assets — like Dow Jones, REA Group, and book publisher Harper Collins — from struggling or unprofitable assets including newspapers and Foxtel. Lachlan Murdoch and his wife, former model and TV presenter Sarah Murdoch, arrive at the court in Reno, Nevada. (AP: Andy Barron) The Starboard resolution comes as the Murdochs await a decision from the Nevada court. It was supposed to be a secret, but in July New York Times reporters Jim Rutenberg and Jonathan Mahler revealed that Rupert was trying to amend the \"irrevocable\" MFT. As it stands, the trust gives his four eldest children an equal say over the future of the empire after he dies. But he now wants to expand the voting power of his chosen successor, eldest son Lachlan, so he would be able to outvote his more politically moderate siblings.  If successful, the move would give Lachlan unassailable control of the staunchly conservative media empire. Rupert called it \"Project Harmony\", but the three siblings — Prudence, Elisabeth, and James — were outraged at being disenfranchised \"for their own good\" and have joined together to fight Rupert and Lachlan in court. Jim Rutenberg says Lachlan is being advantaged against his siblings. (Australian Story: Tom Hancock) Rutenberg said the probate commissioner did not have to decide the best way to maximise the commercial value of the conservative editorial stance of Murdoch media outlets like Fox News. He only had to decide whether Rupert was acting in good faith and in the interests of all beneficiaries of the trust. \"James, Prudence and Elisabeth have a very simple case here, that the trust was written to treat all children equally, and now it's not the case,\" Rutenberg said. \"Now one is being advantaged against the rest. \"If they can prove that it was [not done] in good faith, it would appear that they would win the trial.\" Rupert and Lachlan are expected to break up the empire if they lose their court bid. (Reuters: Fred Greaves) In September, the Murdoch family members filed into a courtroom in Reno for a week-long trial behind closed doors. The case in Nevada is so secret that we may not know the outcome from the court itself, but it is possible the judgement will be leaked to the media. One former senior News executive told Background Briefing the case in Nevada appeared to be a \"lay-down misere\" for Rupert and Lachlan, given the potential economic damage to the businesses that would be done by a shift to a more centrist editorial line at Fox and News Corporation. The former executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said while there had frequently been disputes in the Murdoch family, eldest daughter Prudence had always sat comfortably on the fence and the fact that she was now teamed up with James and Elisabeth showed the conflict had \"gone nuclear\". The question of succession has transfixed media watchers for decades. (ABC) Rutenberg said Lachlan \"won the crown\" but now found himself estranged from his family. \"This is a story directly out of Shakespeare,\" he said. \"This is still, at the end of the day, a family and now it's really broken. And it's broken over things that no other family would contend with.\" Background Briefing has spoken to Sydney stockbroker Angus Aitken, who counts Lachlan as a friend, and hosted him at a private dinner with a dozen fund managers last year at high-end Paddington restaurant, Fred's. Aitken said it would be \"economic suicide\" for Lachlan's three siblings to win in Nevada, outvote him and drag Fox News, which is the empire's crown jewel, to the left. \"My view is, if you replace Lachlan with James, hypothetically tomorrow, and James said, 'I want to pivot this business', I think the profits would drop enormously,\" he said. \"If they fired all the on-air talent that rates and replaced it and said it's all former MSNBC-style of people, I honestly believe the earnings would halve, and the value would halve.\" Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan share similar views. (Reuters: Mike Blake) Aitken said if Rupert and Lachlan were to lose, they were unlikely to sit around waiting for James, Prudence and Elisabeth to take over the empire. He believes they would sell parts of the business and points to the $US71 billion sale of the bulk of their 21st Century Fox business to Disney in 2019, to show how unsentimental the Murdochs can be about businesses they own. \"Lachlan and everyone, they're all beneficiaries of those trusts … why wouldn't you maximise the value for yourself?\" Atkins said. \"You don't want your legacy to be James changing these businesses.\" Of all Murdoch's children, only Lachlan shares Rupert's conservative political views, and has racked up some solid wins in his business career. He was also not implicated in the UK phone hacking scandal that divided his family and tarnished the reputation of James, who had been a viable successor in his own right until that point. Since Rupert's retirement a year ago, Lachlan has been chairman of both Fox and News Corporation. But he has suffered a string of setbacks in recent years, from the shelving of a proposed merger of Fox and News to last year's record payout of $US787.5 million to settle the Dominion defamation case stemming from the 2020 US presidential election. The Dominion Voting Systems defamation suit against Fox News was one of the most hotly anticipated cases in America. In the end, most of the action happened outside the courtroom. Lachlan is also facing unprecedented disruption — politically, a decade of populism is reaching a crescendo with next month's US presidential election; commercially, traditional business models are collapsing as the legacy print and television media grapples with digital transformation from streaming to AI. While Fox Corporation is well-placed financially, and poised to benefit from timely investments in free streaming service Tubi, and sports betting giant Flutter, News Corp is more of a work in progress.  The company continues to reap rewards from Lachlan's investment in the REA Group, although it was rebuffed in a recent takeover for UK property website Rightmove. Financial analyst for Morningstar Brian Han, who has covered the media industry for more than 25 years, agrees that if Rupert and Lachlan lose in Nevada, the possibility of a break-up of the empire increases.  He says that's because there are extremely valuable businesses like Fox News and Dow Jones sitting inside Fox and News. Fox News is the most-watched cable news station in the US. (AP: Mark Lennihan) Han believes the stakes are too high to allow a single probate commissioner in Nevada to decide the future of the empire, suggesting any verdict is likely to be appealed. \"We will see a lot of lawyers get rich for a very, very long time,\" he said. The empire is not falling, Han says, because \"Fox and News Crop are fundamentally still very healthy companies\". \"They've got great balance sheets, which means no matter how bad the structural headwinds are, they're not going to go broke,\" he said. \"Is there going to be the fall of [the Murdoch] dynasty? That's a different question. \"We may have that, because we certainly don't have a set of siblings who are harmonious.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Paddy Manning Topic:Media Topic:Courts and Trials Topic:Human Interest Analysis by Paddy Manning Australia Courts and Trials Human Interest Media Industry US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Superstar Beyoncé has joined US Vice-President Kamala Harris on her campaign trail, with the singer introducing the Democratic presidential nominee at a Houston rally in Texas.  Ms Harris and republican nominee Donald Trump both made stops in the state on Friday, local time, taking a detour from touring the battleground states which will decide November's election. Texas was the first US state to implement a near-total abortion ban.  It has not backed a Democratic president since 1976 and Trump is expected to win the state's 40 electoral college votes.  However, Democrats were hoping the state would provide a powerful backdrop for Vice-President Harris to talk about abortion rights in the final days of her presidential campaign.  The rally saw people swaying and singing along to a DJ in between personal stories about abortion.  Beyonce, who was born in Houston, did not sing at the event but fired up the crowd with a recording of her song Freedom. \"For all the men and women in this room and watching around the country, we need you,\" Beyoncé said in a rare political appearance. \"I'm here as a mother, a mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in. \"A world where we have freedom to control our bodies, a world where we're not divided.\" Beyoncé joined Kamala Harris on stage during a campaign rally in Houston.\n\n \n\n\n  (AP Photo: Annie Mulligan) Ms Harris led the Biden administration's reproductive rights initiatives and has made the issue a cornerstone of her presidential campaign. She came out to a roaring crowd in Houston and spoke about the danger former president Trump and Republicans could present to abortion rights across the country if re-elected.  \"Texas, what is happening across this state and our country is a healthcare crisis and Donald Trump is the architect of it,\" Ms Harris said. Texas implemented a law in September 2021 which banned abortion after six weeks and allowed anyone to sue abortion patients and those who assisted them. Ms Harris told the crowd Trump had erased half a century of hard-fought progress when he appointed the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v Wade — a landmark 1973 court ruling that recognised Americans' right to abortion and legalised it across the nation. Ms Harris was also joined by country music legend Willie Nelson, who sang some of his greatest hits including On the Road Again. While in Texas, Trump taped a podcast episode with Joe Rogan before heading to a rally in Michigan three hours late.  In his interview with Rogan, Trump again suggested he would consider eliminating income tax and replacing the lost revenue with tariffs. \"Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs? Are we serious about that?\" Rogan asked. \"Yeah, sure. Why not?\" Trump replied.

Trump's message on abortion has shifted during his campaign.  He had taken credit for appointing the justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade, but has since said he would not support a national ban on abortions. He has also called for any ban to include exceptions for rape and incest or to protect the health of the mother.

(Reuters: Leah Millis) Voters on both sides hate the feedback loop that is creating more polarisation with each US election. So why is change so elusive? At the annual sweet tater festival in Cullman, Alabama, you'll find live music, fun and food, and a lot of Donald Trump merch. Like, seriously, a lot. Way more than you'd think. \"I'm voting for the felon\" shirts, Trump/Vance trucker hats, badges, and stickers, you name it. When I ask people who they're planning to vote for in November, some of them just laugh at me. And to be fair, in this part of the world, it's kind of a stupid question. Joe Biden won just 10.7 per cent of the vote in Cullman County in 2020. This congressional district is considerably safer than the safest electorate in Australian elections. Their reasons vary. Some like their man (\"Trump is for America, he's not for himself\"), some like their party (\"I just think the Republican Party has a more biblically based agenda\"), and some can't tolerate the other side (\"Have you seen how Democrats are nowadays?\"). They get an impression of the other side from all sorts of sources, but in a place like this, it often isn't from personal experience. Many people will admit they avoid bringing up politics around the few Democrats they know. \"Uh, I try not to,\" one Republican voting woman says. \"I know some, but to each their own, you know.\" \"Some of my friends are Democrats all the way. Some are Republican all the way,\" says another Trump supporter. \"We just don't talk about it.\" The crying shame is that if they did, they might realise a lot of their concerns about the US political system are the same. There are voters on all sides who think politics isn't working the way it should — and getting worse. And they might even be surprised to learn they agree on some of the solutions. America has long been this way, a messy union with deep divisions on questions of national identity. There's probably no avoiding that in a union of 50 states and 50 state identities. There are passionate and committed people on both sides of politics that greatly fear the outcome of the coming election. If the other side wins, they think it'll be the end of the USA as we know it. From the outside, it sometimes feels like American politics is trapped in a downward cycle of polarisation. And America's political institutions are helping to reinforce that. American politics has been realigning over time. There used to be far more ideological diversity within the major parties, but since the civil rights era in the mid-20th century, politics has grown increasingly nationalised, and parties have become more ideologically consistent. In the 1990s, Republican speaker Newt Gingrich introduced his \"Contract with America\", made all Republican candidates sign it and encouraged his colleagues to start calling Democrats terms like \"traitor\", \"corrupt'\", and \"selfish\". So perhaps it's no surprise that partisan hostility has been growing in the US. In 2022, 72 per cent of Republicans and 63 per cent of Democrats said members of the other party are more immoral than other Americans. Those numbers had grown more than 30 percentage points in six years. \"If you look at survey questions from both parties, members of voters of both parties strongly support democracy,\" Gabriel Lenz, a professor of political science at the University of California, says. \"And yet members of both parties are convinced that the other side is determined to take down democracy, undermine it.\" Today, just 19 per cent of US adults think their country is a good example for other countries to follow;  72 per cent agree it used to be. Political candidates and parties undoubtedly play a role in that. Leaders like Donald Trump break political norms and laws and do things that in many other countries would render you unelectable. But that's not the whole story. Because Americans' satisfaction with their democracy has been steadily falling for some time, and politics has been growing more polarised for decades. There's a lot of hostility in Washington DC, and it filters down. Back at the sweet tater festival, Lance Conn, in his light blue rainbow equality shirt, stands out. He's the chair of the Democrats in Cullman County. \"Even wearing this shirt today, walking around outside of this booth felt a little odd,\" he says \"I got some glances. Set up the booth here and we've got Trump T-shirts two doors down.\" His Democrats' stall is plastered with American flags and red, white, and blue paraphernalia, but there's a noticeable lack of Democratic Party material at the Democratic Party stall. They're keeping a low profile. \"We've been able to meet a lot of people here that we didn't know were here. It's down low. I got to make sure that nobody can hear us,\" he says. \"They don't want to be videoed or pictured at the Democrat booth.\" In one of the reddest parts of America, Conn knows he's not going to win many hearts and minds. \"What we're trying to do here today is keep the conversation light,\" he tells me. \"We're not really trying to push an agenda here. \"It's difficult sometimes to not really want to come back with an argument, but we're trying to be a better person and try to keep those conversations going in a helpful way.\" When I ask if that strategy is working, he pauses. \"Perhaps, maybe. Not all the time,\" he eventually says. \"But we've had some good conversations with people … I think it's important to try, regardless.\" Marci McCarthy lives the opposite reality to Conn, as chairwoman of the Republican Party of DeKalb County, one of the bluest counties in Georgia, where she feels like she lives in a \"one-party system\". \"Politics has always been a blood sport, but quite frankly, it's now just a very divided landscape. There are two Americas overall: here's a red state and a blue state. Besides their love for the red, white and blue, perhaps the thing that most closely binds Republicans and Democrats is frustration with the system. But many of the things that drive voters up the wall have long been a design feature of American democracy, not a bug. The founding fathers designed it this way hundreds of years ago. But the founding fathers couldn't have imagined a political environment like the one of today. \"Obviously those guys got along real well in 1787 and couldn't imagine that things could go this far wrong farther down the road,\" says Dot Inman-Johnson, the former Democratic mayor of Tallahassee in Florida. This may be the understatement of the century, but for the record: American politicians do not get along 'real well' in 2024. You can chart out a point in time in recent decades where system stressors got supercharged and started to go off the rails. Take money in politics. Campaigns are expensive and only getting more expensive, especially since the Supreme Court's decision in the 2010 Citizens United case. \"The Citizens United case was a substantial turning point for US money and politics,\" says Anna Massoglia from money in politics research group Open Secrets. \"We saw a surge of dark money flowing into the system.\" The court decided essentially that spending on political issues is a form of free speech and can't be limited. And it paved the way for the creation of Super PACs, a political action committee, that can receive and spend unlimited amounts of money on political ads. They're not allowed to coordinate with politicians themselves, but Anna Massoglia says there are ways around that prohibition. \"Candidates can be special guests at super PAC events as long as they don't ask for more money than they're legally allowed to, but there's very little stopping a candidate from attending an event with a super PAC … and then leaving the room and someone else makes the ask.\" Campaigns can also explicitly telegraph strategy to super PACs, as long as they're not doing it behind closed doors. It's a loophole in the law that many argue renders the guardrails virtually useless. The US electoral system is a fundamentally different structure to Australia, with no central electoral commission or even a central set of national rules for how presidential elections are conducted and counted. It's hugely decentralised. \"Radically decentralised,\" as the Brookings Institute's E J Dionne describes it. \"It's maybe one of the most aggressive federal systems in history, in that every state has its own way of conducting elections,\" says Hans Noel, a professor of politics at Georgetown University. \"They can do their own thing when it comes to deciding how to choose electors to the Electoral College.\" The system does have some benefits, like a layer of protection from widespread fraud — \"you'd have to attack multiple places if you were trying to manipulate an election outcome,\" says law professor Rick Hasen from UCLA — but there are exploitable vulnerabilities throughout the process. The world saw those vulnerabilities up close after the 2020 election, when Donald Trump and his allies put pressure on officials to overturn election results, and disregard certified electoral college votes in congress. Congress has passed changes to rules for the national certification of a presidential election after the Capitol riots of January 6, 2021. The changes are an attempt to de-politicise a process that has become increasing political, and clarify that certification is an administrative job for Congress. If a candidate wants to put political pressure on someone to overturn a result or break the rules, they've got plenty of political allies to choose from. Because the other big difference between the USA and Australia is, without an independently trusted agency like the AEC, the people involved in election management typically have a partisan affiliation. Sometimes the person responsible for elections is themselves an elected official. In Arizona's Maricopa County (a county that you're going to hear a lot about as results are being counted), the current county recorder Stephen Richer lost his Republican primary to a challenger who had previously said the county's election administration was an \"embarrassment\" and had been backed by Republicans who denied the 2020 result. \"If I had to pick an election system, it would be something more like the system in Australia or Canada,\" Hasen says. \"I don't expect to see anything like this in my lifetime in the United States.\" In the US, voting rules themselves have become a hotly contested part of campaign strategy. The system has been exploited from time to time through history, but the contested 2000 election — that led to the controversial Bush vs Gore Supreme Court decision to end a recount of votes in Florida and saw George W Bush win by the closest of margins — made it extremely clear how different electoral laws and procedures could create starkly different outcomes. The tension between states and the federal government is at the centre of what frustrates many about US democracy, and why things are unlikely to change. In Georgia, for example, Republicans in control of the state government passed sweeping and controversial new changes to electoral laws in 2021. They said it was to close loopholes and gaps in electoral law, crack down on voter fraud, and ensure elections are fair. \"We had a situation where there was no willingness to examine any concerns about our elections process, and I talk to people every day who are so discouraged about our elections process that they indicate to me they may not vote,\" Josh McKoon, the Georgia Republican chairman tells me. \"I think that would be a tremendous failure of American democracy.\" Political opponents saw it as an attempt to make it harder to vote in Democratic-leaning parts of the state, as it reduced the window for early voting, added identification requirements for mail-in ballots, limited the number of ballot drop boxes, and banned the supply of food and water to voters waiting in line to vote. The law drew national criticism from civil rights groups and corporate America. Major League Baseball moved its all-star game out of Atlanta in protest against the changes. The CEO of Coca-Cola – which was invented in Atlanta – called the new law \"unacceptable\" and \"a step backwards\". The Republican-dominated state elections board has also imposed a swathe of additional new rules for county election administrators to follow, many of which have been criticised by election administrators, political opponents, and even the Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger. \"We see a lot of gaming, and all of that gaming created the conditions where people were willing to accept this idea that if my side won, the election was fairly conducted … if the other side won, there must have been something wrong with how the election was conducted,\" Rick Hasen says. \"I think Trump supersized that idea and it metastasised into this mass belief in voter fraud as a problem in the United States.\" But attempts to game the system didn't start in 2020 or 2016, or even in 2000. Politicians worked out very early that ground rules could be drawn by those in power to help them stay in power. Take gerrymandering, for example, named after the governor of Massachusetts in 1812, Elbridge Gerry. Unlike in Australia, where an independent body draws electoral district boundaries, in many US states that is a job done by elected politicians. The nation was only a quarter of a century old when politicians in Massachusetts worked out that those lines could be drawn to give members an advantage. Gerry himself wasn't thrilled about the idea and called it \"highly disagreeable\", but signed into law maps that made his own district the shape of a salamander, quickly dubbed a \"gerrymander\". But in the modern political era, with access to modern computing, party strategists worked out how to supercharge re-districting for partisan advantage. Former Republican strategist Thomas Hofeller infamously said that while \"usually the voters get to pick the politicians, in re-districting, the politicians get to pick the voters\". In 1991 he said: \"I define re-districting as the only legalised form of vote-stealing left in the United States today.\" And he's not wrong. \"It used to be hotly contested,\" says Doug Johnson from National Demographics Corporation, which helps governments and elected officials draw maps. \"But a few years ago the US Supreme Court took a step back and said no, we're not going to oversee this field and there's just no way to measure it.\" And so from the politicians in the majority, there's not even a pretence that the process is independent, while politicians in the minority treat the re-districting process as the evidence-gathering phase of an eventual trial. Kelly Skidmore, a Democrat in Florida's state legislature says in that state, it's a matter of \"when, not if\" districts will come before the courts. \"You are considered irrelevant at some points, and no matter how you try to influence the process, you really can't,\" she says. Doug Croley, a member of the Republican committee of Gadsden County in northern Florida, agrees the system isn't ideal. \"I don't know that anything is ever going to end gerrymandering, because the politicians are always going to wish to either save themselves, advance themselves or whatever their political agenda may be,\" he says. \"That's just human nature.\" In states where one party controls the re-districting process, district boundaries are routinely reviewed by judges that are increasingly seen by the public as politicised and partisan. \"It subjects you to the swings of the court, especially at the state level where a lot of our states elect their Supreme Court,\" says Doug Johnson. \"When the power on the state Supreme Court shifts then the interpretation of law can shift pretty significantly.\" For a country that prides itself in the word of its founding documents, big changes in interpretation can come suddenly. Election rules and court challenges became commonplace, especially after the 2000 election and especially since Donald Trump entered the political arena. The courts, and especially the Supreme Court, became viewed as increasingly partisan, and trust in the justice system began to fall. A dramatic shift occurred in 2013, when the Supreme Court suspended part of the national Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965. The Voting Rights Act prohibited any attempts to deny people the right to vote because of their race. It outlawed practices typically used in the south to keep black people from voting, like poll taxes and near-impossible voter literacy tests. It was heralded by many as the single most substantive change in the civil rights act. A decade ago, the court suspended a section of the Act known as pre-clearance, which required states with a history of discrimination to get approval from the Department of Justice or a DC court before changing any electoral law. The effect was immediate. Alabama and Mississippi enacted voter ID laws, North Carolina did that and more, including ending same-day registration for voters. In Texas, a voter ID law that had been on the books for two years, but blocked by the pre-clearance rules, took immediate effect. The foundations of America's electoral system shifted in one court decision. The Brennan Centre for Justice commissioned research finding that the turnout gap between black and white Americans, which had been falling for decades since the Voting Rights Act was enacted, has grown this century. Black activists don't think it's because of a lack of interest in voting. Deborah Scott leads get out the vote group Georgia Stand UP. \"People want to unravel the Voting Rights Act because it gives power to people that they don't think deserve to have the power,\" she says. \"Black people in this country deserve power. Black people in this country have helped to make this country.\" There's a feedback loop here. As politicians game election rules, there are fewer competitive elections. That contributes to growing polarisation, reducing incentives for politicians to compromise and increasing building the desire for them to game the rules further. It's one of the reasons the current Congress has been the least productive one in decades. The risk when the country becomes hyper-polarised, with different parties in control of different arms of government, is that the checks and balances in the American political system turn into gridlock. \"If the division is fairly close, so that the two sides are roughly the same size, then there's no reason to compromise,\" Hans Noel says. \"You just wait until the next election when maybe you are in power and then you don't have to compromise with the other side.\" \"Democracy is supposed to be able to handle different opinions … we ought to be able to have a system that can accommodate that.\" \"But when you're not comfortable compromising with them, you're not comfortable living among them, that is where you start to see a problem.\" \"You start to not trust the outcomes of elections, you don't trust the results that come from any kind of political process.\" Travelling through the United States, through blue states, red states, and swing states, you pick up the uneasiness people feel about politics. Party activists don't understand how people on the other side think. Unengaged voters will tell you that politics has a weird vibe about it at the moment. It's partly about the stakes of this election. It's partly about the entire political system in Washington. Most voters want gerrymandering abolished. Most voters want less money in politics. But making changes like that requires everyone to work together at the same time. When politics is as divided as it is now, laying down arms isn't seen as an option, or you'll face electoral oblivion. Polarisation itself isn't new. The country has been here before. At a gala dinner hosted by the Democrats in Fulton County, Georgia, I speak with South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, a powerbroker within the party. He insists that America hasn't fundamentally changed: \"I don't know where people get this from … in 1776, when this country was created, it was created out of a protest.\" Democracy is a moving process, Clyburn says. \"There's nothing stagnant about democracy. It is what the Founders meant when they say, 'In pursuit of a more perfect union'. We're not perfect, probably never will be, but you should always be in pursuit of perfection.\" Democrat Kelly Skidmore puts it more bluntly: \"This is how our politics works. If you think it's only happening now and that we're in some kind of a downward spiral, go back and learn your history.\" At the tater fest, I speak to Jackson, a Louisiana native who's just moved to Alabama for university. \"I'd say the biggest difference is people don't season their food here quite as much as we do back in Louisiana,\" he says. And while Jackson, likely nearly everyone here, would probably vote for Trump (\"I'm a Catholic and so abortion is a big thing for me\"), there's no guarantee he'll vote at all. Young people like Jackson are watching the hostility of politics and the stereotypes of the other side coming from political leaders and the media and getting frustrated. Voter turnout in Alabama is on the low side, and a lot of people argue the uncompetitive elections in this state contribute to that. \"I just turned 18 so this would be the first year I could vote. I'm not sure if I will. I know this is like a bad thing to say as an American citizen but I don't think I would need to vote for either side … like I don't think I would sway the election. I plan in the future being a more participatory American.\" But as more Americans disengage from a system they see as far from perfect, he might find it's a lonely place to be. The road America takes in \"pursuit of a more perfect union\" is littered with potholes. Voters – and the world's – eyes are on whether the country gets bogged.

Look back on what happened with our live blog. By Audrey Courty If you're just catching up, here's a quick summary of what happened on the campaign trail today: By Audrey Courty Thanks for joining us on the campaign trail today. We'll resume our live coverage of the US election tomorrow morning. In the meantime, you can read our daily wrap of the campaign events below. Enjoy the rest of your day! By Audrey Courty Now let's take a look at what national polls tell us about how American voters are feeling ahead of the US election. According to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about 4 in 10 registered voters say they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" concerned about violent attempts to overturn the upcoming results. And about 1 in 3 voters say they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" concerned about attempts by local or state election officials to stop the results from being finalised. Relatively few voters — about one-third or less — are \"not very\" or \"not at all\" concerned about any of that happening. Meanwhile, in a New York Times and Siena College poll, three-quarters of American voters say democracy is under threat. These findings speak to persistent concerns about the fragility of the world's oldest democracy, nearly four years after former president Donald Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results inspired the US Capitol riots. Trump has continued to lie about fraud costing him re-election and is again forecasting that he can lose this time only if the election is rigged against him. By Andrew Thorpe While Donald Trump's choice of Madison Square Garden for a rally venue had a significance that went beyond raw electoral politics, it's hard to see any similar logic in former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney's choice of a performing arts center in Newark to host an event for Ms Harris on the same day. Billed as \"An Afternoon with Liz Cheney\", the conservative-royalty-turned-Trump-critic hit on familiar themes as she made the case for the VP to what The New York Times described as an \"enthusiastic audience\" in deep-blue New Jersey. Ms Harris's embrace of Ms Cheney's support (and that of her father, former VP Dick Cheney) has raised some eyebrows among Democrats, especially given the Cheneys' record on the Middle East while the party is still working to win over progressive constituencies in key states like Michigan who are reluctant to back Ms Harris given the White House's approach to the war in Gaza. The Harris campaign appears to be gambling that there are enough Republicans looking for \"permission\" to ditch Trump to offset left-leaning Democrats put off by the sometimes odd coupling of Harris and Cheney. By Audrey Courty Most national surveys show it's a razor-thin race for the White House. According to the final New York Times and Siena College poll (margin of error 2.2%) released on Friday, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are tied for the popular vote at 48% to 48%. The poll represents a decline in support for Harris since the Times's previous poll in early October that showed her with a 49% to 46% lead over Trump. However, Harris is still up by three points, 49% to 46%, in an Economist and YouGov survey (margin of error 3%) of likely voters released on Wednesday. By Andrew Thorpe While there's a lot of attention being paid to the wave of Puerto Rican entertainers lining up to endorse Kamala Harris's candidacy after Trump's New York rally, it's worth noting that singer Ariana Grande also revealed on Instagram (where she boasts more followers than Taylor Swift) earlier today that she voted for the VP. The singer also shared a message from Michelle Obama urging her followers to \"vote like our lives depend on it\". \"Kamala Harris is putting in the work. We see it every day. But she can't win this thing alone,\" Ms Obama says in the video. By Audrey Courty Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe has defended himself against backlash for joking that Puerto Rico is a \"floating island of garbage\". In a post on social media, Hinchcliffe dismissed his critics as having \"no sense of humour\". In a direct response to criticism from Kamala Harris's campaign, including Governor Tim Walz, he wrote: \"Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his 'busy schedule' to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. \"I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone... watch the whole set.\" By Audrey Courty Kamala Harris had this to say about Donald Trump after his Madison Square rally today: Earlier, Trump called Harris a \"very low IQ individual\" and drew cheers from rally supporters for his tough-on-migrants rhetoric. \"On day one I will launch the largest deportation program in American history,\" he said. \"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.\" Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe had earlier opened Trump's rally by describing the Caribbean US territory of Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage\". Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, told Reuters that the joke about Puerto Rico \"does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.\" By Audrey Courty Good afternoon. I'm Audrey Courty, and I'm joining our afternoon coverage of the US election. According to the White House, US President Joe Biden will cast his early-voting ballot in the presidential election on Monday (local time). Biden stood aside earlier this year in the contest that now pits Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Kamala Harris. He is expected to cast his ballot in his home state of Delaware where he served as its senator from 1973 to 2009. By Elissa Steedman Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have finished up another day of campaigning. But with Election Day just around the corner, there's no time for rest. Here's where you can expect to see each candidate popping up next. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz:  Donald Trump and JD Vance:  By Elissa Steedman Election Day may be more than a week away but almost 42 million Americans have already cast their vote, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. About half those early birds used mail ballots, while the other half attended in-person polling places. By Elissa Steedman Thousands of supporters turned out for Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden in New York today. Here's a look at some in the crowd. By Elissa Steedman A New York Times / Siena poll has found 45 per cent of respondents don't feel the US democracy does a good job of representing constituents.

He tells his audience about watching a Space X rocket launch on television. \"He's amazing and he's a great guy too, he really is,\" Trump says of Elon Musk. The former president then marvels at Musk's ability to sell any MAGA merchandise he wears. \"All I have to do is put something on him! Ah, you're great.\" Trump then moves on to highlighting Robert F Kennedy Jr and Melania Trump's resumes. By Elissa Steedman Donald Trump tells the crowd he made taking presidential office \"a very dangerous\" position. \"You know, if you drive a racecar, you have one tenth of one per cent chance of dying. \"If you ride the bulls, I think the bulls are pretty nasty, right? You have about the same one tenth of one per cent of dying. \"If you become president of the United States, you've got a hell of a shot at dying. \"I never knew that when I ran, I never thought about it but here we are and I'm OK with it. \"I would rather be here than any place in the world.\" By Elissa Steedman Donald Trump has pivoted from discussing illegal immigrants to compare his speech-giving abilities with those of Kamala Harris. \"Isn't it nice to have somebody that's your president that doesn't need a teleprompter?\" he says.  \"We haven't been on teleprompter for a long time, I haven't been on this teleprompter. \"No, it is nice. You saw the other day where Kamala got a little stuck on, the teleprompter went a little bad, it stopped on her. \"You have to be, you know, if you're a politician, you have to handle that. \"Remember? You have to do the weave, he says. You have to do more than the weave.\" He then goes on to mimic Harris losing her place in a speech. \"She was gone, and then, dammit, it kicked back on. She was on!\" By Elissa Steedman Donald Trump has taken aim at undocumented immigrants, falsely claiming Kamala Harris has \"imported criminal migrants\" into the US. After taking a pause to play a video package of news reports on crimes allegedly committed by immigrants, Trump told the crowd illegal immigration rates were \"like an Elon Musk rocket ship\" under the Biden-Harris administration.  \"If they [deported immigrants] come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole,\" he said. \"And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Rachel Wisniewski) When Donald Trump takes to the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden on Monday, he's expected to have the world's richest person on hand to help him rally the crowd. Elon Musk has emerged as a major player in the former president's election efforts, unveiling attention-grabbing initiatives such as giving away $US1 million ($1.5 million) every day until November 5. To be eligible, you would need to be a registered voter in one of the seven swing states expected to decide the election. You'd also have to sign a petition supporting the first and second amendments of the US constitution (the ones relating to the right to free speech and to bear arms). Election experts were quick to raise concerns that the cash bonanza could breach laws preventing people from being paid to register to vote or to cast a ballot. But the billionaire hasn't been deterred. So how did Musk become such a central figure at this election, and what's in it for him? The former president and Space X owner haven't always had such a cosy relationship. At a campaign rally in 2022, Trump accused the billionaire of lying about who he'd voted for in previous presidential elections, describing him as a \"bullshit artist\". Musk responded by suggesting Trump should \"hang up his hat and sail into the sunset\". Musk reinstated Trump's Twitter account later that year, after buying the social media company now known as X. But he then used the platform to launch the failed presidential bid of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was challenging Trump for the Republican nomination. And when Musk declared last year he would not vote for Joe Biden despite having supported past Democratic candidates, he added: \"I'm not saying I'd vote for Trump.\" The Wall Street Journal traces Musk's move away from the Democratic Party to Biden's snubbing of the Tesla co-founder at electric vehicles events in 2021. Musk, now 53, had previously described himself as politically \"moderate\", but publicly criticised COVID-19 lockdowns and moved two of his companies out of California following the passage of a law relating to gender identity in schools. He's since used X to decry what he calls the \"woke mind virus\" and to amplify right-wing conspiracy theories — including those spread by Trump. By May this year, he had launched a political action committee (PAC) to support Trump's re-election bid. And in July, when the former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, Musk formally endorsed him. Musk has since become a vocal advocate for Trump, jumping on stage alongside the former president at a recent rally and drumming up support for him on X. But his biggest contribution comes in the form of cash. \"Usually the high-visibility people who get involved in political campaigns are entertainers and sports figures, but business people tend to give the money quietly,\" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"They're not looking to attract a lot of controversy. \"But [Musk] is not one to shy away from any controversy. In fact, he seems to be very comfortable being right in the middle of controversy.\" Elon Musk takes part in a Trump rally at the site of an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Musk has reportedly poured at least $U118 million ($178 million) into the America PAC, which is legally allowed to raise and spend money to support a candidate but can't directly coordinate with a campaign. Campaign finance lawyer Brendan Fischer believes the PAC's original offer to pay $US47 to people who referred others to sign the petition was legal because it wasn't directly incentivising someone to register to vote. But he argues the $1 million a day giveaway goes too far. \"At first glance, this might appear to be a very technical violation,\" he said. \"But billionaires and corporations and dark money groups are already spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to influence our vote. \"If direct payments to voters to register and to vote is allowed to become the norm, then a new avenue for wealthy special interest money is going to open in our elections.\" The billionaire said he would make daily payments to people who sign his online petition backing the US Constitution. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly written to the America PAC, warning the initiative could violate federal law. The daily announcement of winners was briefly paused, however the giveaway has since resumed. \"I would not expect that the DOJ would initiate a criminal action in the two weeks before the election,\" Mr Fischer said. \"But at this point, Elon Musk and America PAC are on notice that the Justice Department views what they are doing as unlawful. And the question now is whether they're going to change course.\" Musk is a hugely influential figure across the tech, auto and space industries. He counts the US government as a major client, with Space X holding multi-billion-dollar contracts with NASA and the Defense Department to launch their rockets and satellites. Trump has promised that if he's elected he will set up a \"government efficiency commission\" tasked with carrying out audits across the federal government and recommending \"drastic reforms\". He says the idea was suggested by Musk and that the billionaire has agreed to lead it — an appointment that would likely raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. Professor Gordon said he expected Musk would use such a role to try to force changes within the federal regulatory bodies he's previously sparred with. \"I think he will try to influence regulation policy about space,\" he said. \"I think space is probably even more important to him than the cars. But he thinks that Tesla has suffered greatly at the hands of red tape. \"He has tangled with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk has done a bunch of arm wrestling with them. I think he'll try to streamline their processes.\" Elon Musk and his America PAC have been put on notice by the Department of Justice.  (Reuters: Carlos Barria) Professor Gordon believes Musk's overriding motivation is to help elect an administration that would take his ideas seriously. \"He wants to have the freedom to do what he wants to do. He wants to push autonomous vehicle technology forward, he wants to push space technology forward to Mars,\" he said. \"And he sees government as being an impediment to progress.\" Musk has drawn the ire of some Democrats, including vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz. \"Elon's on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit on these things,\" he told supporters at a rally in Wisconsin. \"You know it,\" he said. Biden also criticised the billionaire, seizing on allegations that Musk — who was born in South Africa — worked illegally in the US early on in his career. Musk denied the reports and accused the president of lying. \"He was violating the law. He's talking about all these 'illegals' coming our way,\" Biden said in reference to Musk's embrace of Trump's immigration stance. But John Fetterman, a Democratic senator for the must-win state of Pennsylvania, warned his party it would mock Musk at its peril. \"Musk is incredibly popular and he has an appeal to a demographic that Democrats have struggled with,\" he told The Hill. \"And to some people, they see him as … [Marvel character] Tony Stark. He's the world's richest man and he's undeniably a brilliant guy.\" Musk is hardly the only billionaire involved in this election. Trump has several other so-called \"mega-donors\", while Microsoft founder Bill Gates is reported to have privately donated $US50 million to an organisation supporting Ms Harris. In what could be the most expensive election in US history, their influence will be consequential.

This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In Monday's wrap, we take a look at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally and a major newspaper's refusal to pick a presidential winner.  Let's get into it. Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump has headlined a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Before Mr Trump's arrival, a mixed bag of donors, politicians and celebrities took to the stage to unleash a tidal wave of rhetoric. \"[Donald Trump] is full of grievance. He is full of dark language that is about retribution and revenge.” — Kamala Harris. One labelled Vice President Kamala Harris \"the Antichrist\".  Another attacked Puerto Rico, labelling it \"a floating island of garbage\", a comment which has since sparked outrage from officials, the Puerto Rican community and celebrities such as rapper Bad Bunny. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson took aim at Ms Harris's background, claiming anyone not impressed by her would be labelled a \"freak\" or \"criminal\".  When Mr Trump finally began his 80-minute long speech, he told the crowd the Democratic party was being run by an \"amorphous group\" of powerful people. \"They're smart and they're vicious, and we have to defeat them,\" he said.  Trump supporters packed Madison Square Garden.  (Reuters: Andrew Kelly) He went on to repeat a highly controversial phrase he has previously used on the campaign trail, describing his opponents as \"the enemy within\".  He also described election day as a potential \"liberation\" from migrants in the United States.  Media on the ground noted the crowd at the initially packed arena had begun to thin considerably before the speech finished.  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz have taken the campaign to gaming platform Twitch.  The pair, continuing a trend by Democrats of trying to appeal to younger voters, live-streamed themselves playing football game Madden and farming simulator Stardew Valley. \"I see gamers, many times, are on the front end of this,\" Mr Walz said, of engaging with voters via online platforms.  The gender divide in politics is a sleeper issue in Australia, with men and women — particularly young people — moving apart in profound and polarising ways, as opinions of the upcoming US election show.  \"It's a collaborative community and they're competitive ... For people who are most frustrated, they need to see stuff getting done.\"   More than 12,000 users tuned in to watch the stream.  Ms Ocasio-Cortez told viewers: “I do not think Governor Walz would have hopped on here if he didn’t value the power of the coalition we have here.\"  The stream ended with a \"surprise\" game from Mr Walz — Crazy Taxi, his favourite game for the Sega Dreamcast.  The Washington Post newspaper will no longer endorse a candidate in the presidential election.  It came after a decision by the paper's billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, according to the New York Times.  The Washington Post has endorsed candidates since 1976, when it gave its approval to Jimmy Carter.  At least one high-level staffer, editor-at-large of the opinion department Robert Kagan, has already resigned following the announcement. Other outlets, including the New York Times, The Boston Globe and the New York Post, have already endorsed either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.  The Washington Post's former executive editor, Marty Baron, called the decision \"cowardice, with democracy as its casualty\".  \"[Donald Trump] will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner [Jeff Bezos] and others.  \"Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\"  Hulk Hogan tears his shirt during a rally for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  (Reuters: Carlos Barria) Former pro-wrestler Hulk Hogan was among almost two dozen opening speakers at the Trump rally in Madison Square Garden.  He used his time on stage to address the \"Trump-a-maniacs\" in the crowd.  \"I don't see no stinking Nazis in here, I don't see no stinking domestic terrorists in here,\" he said.  \"The only thing that I see in here are a bunch of hard-working men and women that are real Americans ... [Donald Trump] sounds for real, brother.\"  Supporters of Kamala Harris are more confident that the election will have a clear outcome after votes are counted, according to a new survey. A report by the Pew Research Center says Harris supporters are 85 per cent certain the winner will be clear following the vote count, compared to 38 per cent of Trump supporters. The independent research organisation surveyed 5,110 US adults, including 4,025 registered voters. Harris supporters were also more confident mail-in ballots would be counted \"as voters intended\" and that the election system was secure from \"hacking and other technological threats\". \"Those who support Trump are deeply sceptical about the way the election will be conducted,\" the report said. \"[They are] expressing even less confidence on some election issues than [they] did four years ago.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Brian Snyder) It's a perfect late October Autumn day that greets Donald Trump in Greenville, North Carolina. The leaves are on the turn, resplendent reds punching through the sea of green. Red punctuates the waiting crowd too, with the identifiable MAGA cap proudly displayed by many of those lining up and particularly popular among young men. One of them is 23-year-old Jack Lawrence, who's excited to see Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the flesh, a man he describes as \"strong, charismatic, empathetic.\" He's aligned with Trump on the issues that matter to him, citing immigration and the economy. But for Jack, Trump's appeal goes beyond his policies. He says masculinity has been put on the \"backburner\" by Democrats. Jack Lawrence, 23, likes Trump's plans for border control and the economy. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) \"[Trump promises] to bring back the masculine face that that you saw back in the 60s and 70s with American men,\" he says. \"Just strong men providing for their family and just being able to be men and not be pressured down, like the left is really trying to push right now.\" Jack says he grew up in a small town, about an hour's drive from Greenville, with \"Christian values\". He's now studying construction management at East Carolina University which he says is \"definitely a more conservative-leaning school than liberal\". He also thinks the polls underestimate Trump's support. \"There's a lot more people that are scared to voice their opinion than you really think,\" he says, because they'd previously been \"getting hated on just because of their political affiliation\". Trump's increasing appeal to young men may end up becoming one of the defining subplots of this campaign. Throughout his political career, he has marketed himself as a fighter and a tough guy. During his 2024 presidential campaign, he has attended wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA) fights. At the Republican National Convention, where Trump officially accepted his party's nomination, he had former wrestling star Hulk Hogan as one of the speakers. Hulk Hogan gave an impassioned speech at the Republican National Convention. (Reuters: Mike Segar) When talking to the women of America, he promised to be their \"protector\". And one of his surrogates, former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, recently described Trump as \"daddy\", painting a vivid image of him returning to the White House to spank a wayward daughter. \"When Dad gets home, you know what he says?\" Carlson asked the crowd at an event by Turning Point USA, an organisation pushing conservative politics on school and college campuses. \"'You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad little girl, and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now.'\" In what might be the closest election in modern US history, Trump is hoping he can get a notoriously unreliable voting bloc — young men — off the couch and into the polling booths to put him back into the White House. To appeal to non-traditional voters, Trump's campaign knew their candidate had to meet them where they were. Rather than focusing only on interviews with mainstream broadcasting outlets, Trump has instead looked to podcasters, YouTubers and influencers who have millions of young, male followers. He invited online pranksters the Nelk Boys onto his plane and appeared on comedian Theo Von's YouTube channel for a long sit-down interview, which covered everything from cocaine to the power of lobby groups. Then, he nabbed perhaps the most sought-after slot in American media in 2024: A three-hour conversation with the world's biggest podcaster, Joe Rogan. It's hard to know exactly which parts of the campaign are striking a chord, but it appears that an increasing number of young men are buying what Trump is selling. Young men in MAGA caps are a common sight at Trump's rallies. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) Traditionally, American men under 30 have strongly skewed towards Democrats in national elections. But recent polling from Harvard Kennedy School suggests that since 2020, \"the share of young men identifying as registered Democrats has dropped by 7 percentage points, while those identifying as Republicans have increased by 7 points — a net shift of 14 points in just four years\". Sunshine Hillygus, a professor of political science at North Carolina's Duke University, points out it's notoriously difficult to gather robust data on a group who is \"really hard to get to cooperate\". But she says there's mounting evidence of a noticeable shift. Just weeks before the US election, polls suggest the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remains a dead heat. In the key battleground state of Arizona, abortion might be a deciding factor.  \"There has been a large spike in young women calling themselves liberal,\" she says. \"That's kind of a summary across all the issues, and when we deep-dive on individual issues, that's where you see greater concern about climate, reproductive rights for young women compared to young men.\" Concerns about inflation and the economy, meanwhile, tend to be \"a higher rated issue of concern for young men\", Professor Hillygus says. She expects this shift will result in a different voting pattern on election day. \"A much larger percentage of young women are predicted to vote for Harris than young men,\" she says. While Trump has been popping up across the bro media sphere, Kamala Harris has also been narrowcasting her message, particularly to young women. She did an interview on the mega-popular Call Her Daddy, which is Spotify's second-biggest podcast, only behind The Joe Rogan Experience. The 40-minute conversation weaved through Harris's backstory, as well as issues like housing affordability. But the major focus was on abortion access. Host Alex Cooper said she was torn about inviting a politician onto her show, which enjoys about five million downloads a week. \"I had been going back and forth with this decision for a while to get involved or to not get involved, but at the end of the day, I couldn't see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women and I'm not a part of it.\" The issue of reproductive rights has been motivating voters since the overturning of Roe v Wade. (Reuters: Jonathan Drake) Harris's deliberate outreach to young women appears to be paying off. A poll by NBC found that American women under 30 said they'll vote for Harris over Trump by a 33-point margin. Eighteen-year-old Eva Eapen says she's noticed a major difference among her age group. Eva, a student at North Carolina University at Chapel Hill, calls herself an independent voter. But she is volunteering with the Democratic campaign for state governor and will be voting for Harris for president. Eva Eapen, 18, says she's an independent voter, but this election she's volunteering for the Democrats. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) \"I think young men are gravitating towards Trump at an astounding degree,\" she says. \"And I think that young women are rallying for Kamala Harris. \"I have seen it in my own friends. I've spoken to friends who have seen it in their male friends or male siblings or male partners.\" Eva says there are issues where she doesn't agree with the Democrats, like border policy (she says \"the southern border is a little bit of a mess\"). But she says the vice-president's promise to restore a nationwide right to abortion is critical to her. \"Reproductive rights is huge, as I think it is for women across the country,\" she said. \"[It is] pivotal for so many women, conservative women included. \"I think they're rallying to say that we feel like we're losing our autonomy. We feel like our agency is being threatened and challenged, and that is something to vote for. That is something to fight for.\" Kamala Harris is strongly preferred by women under 30, polling has found. (Reuters: Jonathan Drake) She called Harris's appearance on Call Her Daddy a \"brilliant move\" because \"the audience for that podcast is not politically engaged women\". Conversely, she thinks the Democrats have done a terrible job of engaging with young men who have \"been neglected by the left and by the Democratic Party for a very long time\". With just a week to go before election day, both the national and key swing state polls are effectively tied. There's little confidence amongst pollsters about which way this election will go, but most expect the gender gap in 2024 will be more pronounced than in previous campaigns. And in an election that could come down to a few thousand votes, getting young people to the polls could be the difference between victory and defeat. But there could be a problem: Young Americans under 30 are not traditionally reliable voters. Young people turned out for Donald Trump's rally in Greenville, but how many will show up to vote? (ABC News: Bradley McLennan) Voting isn't mandatory in the United States, and a major challenge for candidates is motivating people to show up and cast their ballots. The presidential election in 2020 saw unusually high turnout by young people, but it was still just over 50 per cent. Professor Hillygus says the younger voting cohort could prove crucial \"When you're dealing with an evenly divided bipartisanship state, the turnout among young people can make the difference.\" — with Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Jade Macmillan Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Gender Roles US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

With eight days to go to the presidential election, almost 42 million Americans have already voted but the race remains extremely tight, with The New York Times' latest national poll putting support for Harris and Trump at 48 per cent apiece. Look back on what happened with our live blog. By Liana Walker Thanks for joining us on the campaign trail today. We'll resume our live coverage of the US election tomorrow morning. In the meantime, you can read our daily wrap of the campaign events below. Enjoy the rest of your day! By Liana Walker What are the polls saying about the state of the new House Reps and Senate? If Harris is ahead on popular vote then possibly Trump as president could have a hostile Congress? - Ian Thanks for the question, Ian! I'm using Project 538 to help answer this. They use aggregated data conducted by other firms and organisations to form the foundation of their polling averages and election forecasts. Right now, the polls are saying Harris is ahead by just 1.4 per cent, so it's still anyone's race for president. In the Congress it's even tighter. The Democrats are ahead by just 0.7 per cent.  In the Senate, the focus is more on the key states. Here's a sample of who is ahead from the past few days: By Liana Walker Kamala Harris will deliver her campaign's \"closing argument\" Tuesday from the same spot in Washington where Republican Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. She chose the spot to draw a contrast between her vision for the country and Trump's continued lies about the 2020 election, and the risks she says his return to the White House would pose for the nation. More than 1,500 people have been charged in the Capitol siege in the years since. Reporting with AP By Liana Walker These rally’s take so much precious time, but aren’t they preaching to the converted? I understand securing the base, but  It seems disproportionate effort rather than putting disproportionate effort into the undecided? - Mich Hey Mich! That's a great question, I ask myself the same thing sometimes! The National Bureau of Economic Research had a look into this between 2008 and 2016 by studying the campaign rallies held in this time and measuring the short term causal impact. The study found: Rallies can also be a way to raise money — in markets where Trump held a rally, that was on average  $US1,130 a day!  That's just a short summary of the findings, you can read the full paper here.  By Liana Walker  Kamala Harris also has a jam-packed schedule this week travelling around the states. She'll be headed to: By Liana Walker It's crunch time which means the US election campaign is going into overdrive! This week Donald Trump will be headed to: By Elissa Steedman Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice-President Kamala Harris, has warned the re-election of Donald Trump would threaten American Jews. \"There is a fire in this country, and we either pour water on it or we pour gasoline on it,\" he said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, earlier today. \"One thing we know about antisemitism is that whenever chaos and cruelty are given a green light, Jew-hatred has historically not far behind. \"And that matters so much today because Donald Trump is nothing if not an agent of chaos and cruelty.\" He credited Harris for urging him to \"use my voice\" on the issue and said he and his wife were committed to \"extinguishing this epidemic of hate\". \"Kamala feels it in her kishkes.\" Emhoff is the first Jewish second spouse.  When Harris was sworn into office as vice-president, she and Emhoff placed a mezuzah on the VP residence in Washington, DC. He said if Harris is elected president, he would see if one could be placed on the White House. \"Three months from now, the White House residence could — I have to check first — could have a mezuzah on its doorpost.\" Reporting with AP By Liana Walker Shortly after stand-up comic Tony Hinchcliffe said that, \"I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,\" Puerto Rican reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny announced he was backing Harris. Hinchcliffe's comments also prompted reaction from other Puerto Rican stars including Ricky Martin, who previously endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He posted a video of the crude joke and wrote, \"This is what they think of us.\" Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress for the pro-statehood New Progressive Party and a Trump supporter, called the comments \"despicable, misguided and disgusting.\" \"They do not represent the values of the GOP,\" she said. Governor Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat, wrote on Facebook: \"Garbage is what came out of Tony Hinchcliffe’s mouth, and everyone who applauded him should feel ashamed for disrespecting Puerto Rico.\" By Liana Walker An Associated Press poll has found American voters are approaching the presidential election with deep unease about what could follow, including the potential for political violence, attempts to overturn the election results and its broader implications for democracy. The findings of the survey speak to persistent concerns about the fragility of the world's oldest democracy, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results inspired a mob of his supporters to storm the US Capitol. About four in 10 registered voters say they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" concerned about violent attempts to overturn the results after the November election. About one in three voters say they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" concerned about attempts by local or state election officials to stop the results from being finalised. Reporting with AP By Elissa Steedman Donald Trump will hold his election night party at the Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida. The venue was announced by his campaign earlier today. It's about a 10-minute drive from his residence, Mar-a-Lago Club. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan I've been spending time in Erie, Pennsylvania, an area that has a reputation for picking the winner of presidential elections. Voters here seem split on who they think is going to win next week. But most people we spoke to agreed with the opinion polls that suggest this could be an incredibly close race. Questions have been raised about whether we should trust the polls this time around, given they tended to under-estimate support for Donald Trump at the past two elections. \"Polling in both 2016 and 2020 was likelier to understate Donald Trump, not everywhere, but in a lot of places, particularly in the industrial northern states that are so critical,\" Kyle Kondik from the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia told me. \"But it's also possible that pollsters have tried to over-correct for past problems, missing out on Trump voters, and maybe they're actually understating Harris voters. I mean, it's hard to know.\" Polling methods have changed over the years, with calls to landlines replaced by online surveys and even old-fashioned mail drops. But in a country as diverse as the United States, with no compulsory voting, getting in touch with the right mix of people (who'll then follow through at the ballot box) is a big challenge. \"Just because the polls are really close doesn't mean that the election will necessarily be as close as some of the recent ones have been,\" Mr Kondik said. \"But certainly that's what the polls are telling us right now. It's hard to say that either candidate is really favoured at this point, and that's been the case for really most of the election cycle.\" By Elissa Steedman Authorities, including the FBI are investigating after hundreds of ballots were destroyed by fires lit at drop boxes in Washington and Oregon. Investigators say there is evidence to suggest the fires are linked. By Elissa Steedman More than $2.1 billion in federal assistance was granted to those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, a statement from the White House has revealed. \"This includes over $1 billion in assistance for individuals and families to help pay for housing repairs, personal property replacement, and other recovery efforts,\" the statement reads. \"To date, the Administration has also approved over $1.1 billion in Public Assistance funding to support local and state governments. \"This funding is primarily being used to support debris removal, as well to pay for emergency protective measures like surging first responders and providing shelter, food, and water during and after the storms.\" One month since Hurricane Helene made landfall, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is now operating 65 disaster recovery centres across impacted communities. The federal government's handling of the recovery has been criticised by Donald Trump, who falsely claimed it had diverted money from FEMA to \"illegal immigrants\". By Liana Walker Hello! I'll be joining Elissa for the next hour or so and be taking you into the afternoon with all the latest out of the US election campaign. If you're just joining us now, here's a quick summary of what has happened so far today: It's now just 10pm in DC, but there is still plenty to unpack from today's events. Stick with us! By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan Americans are passionate about politics and I’ve seen quite a lot of creativity on both sides when it comes to showing support for candidates. But a life-sized mannequin of Donald Trump, strapped to the back of a trailer and decked out in a suit and faded MAGA hat, has got to be up there in terms of eye-catching promotional tools.  Brian Shank has been using it to try to get the attention of motorists passing through his home of Erie, Pennsylvania. \"It's about a 90 per cent plus approval rating, people coming by and beeping,\" he tells me from a local carpark. \"We got a couple negative comments, but that's all right. We just say, 'God loves you too' and we roll through it.\" Brian says he takes care to make sure the mannequin is safely attached before he takes it on the road. \"When he's going down the road at 50 miles an hour, you have to have [be] secure,\" he says. \"Because that would really stink if Donald Trump came crashing through your front window.\" By Elissa Steedman If you missed Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden in New York yesterday, jokes made by a warm-up speaker have drawn condemnation today. By Elissa Steedman Barack Obama tells the crowd when speaking to those disillusioned about politics, he doesn't \"sell them the moon\". \"Politics is not going to solve all your problems,\" he says. \"Whoever's in there as president is not going to change everything, is not going to eliminate poverty, no matter how well-meaning a president may be. Politics is not a cure-all. \"But your vote matters because government, a president, a senator, they can make your life a little better or a little worse. And that little better adds up; that little worse adds up too.\" By Elissa Steedman In response to Donald Trump's rhetoric about immigration, Barack Obama tells the crowd, \"we are a nation of immigrants\". He tells supporters to ask themselves a \"simple question. \"Donald Trump, JD Vance, they're always talking about, 'Well, Kamala's been vice-president for four years, so she has to take responsibility for all that', even though she wasn't actually the president,\" he says.  \"Well, wasn't Donald Trump president for four years? Somehow that's conveniently forgotten.\" Obama goes on to say Trump failed to solve the issue while in office because \"he did not have a real plan, he had concepts of a plan\". He references the bipartisan border bill that was shot down by Trump. \"He believed that it was better not to solve the problem so he could use the issue in the election, so he could engage in fear-mongering.\" By Elissa Steedman Barack Obama says \"bigoted\" remarks made by speakers at Donald Trump's New York rally are \"the reason why this election should not be close\". \"These are fellow citizens he's talking about,\" he says.  \"They're in Philadelphia. They are your neighbours, they are your friends, they are your co-workers. Their kids go to school with your kids. \"Here's a good rule: if somebody does not respect you, if somebody does not see you as fellow citizens with equal claims to opportunity, to the pursuit of happiness, to the American Dream, you should not vote for them. You should not expect them to make your life better.\" By Elissa Steedman Barack Obama tells the audience he understands why voters might be looking to \"shake things up\" but says Donald Trump won't solve the cost of living. \"Now, we know this election's going to be tight. It shouldn't be but it will be because a lot of Americans are still struggling,\" he says. \"We have been through a lot over the last few years: an historic pandemic that wreaked havoc on communities and businesses and then, disruptions from the pandemic caused price hikes and that put a strain on family budgets. \"People started feeling like no matter how hard they worked, they were just treading water. So I get why people might want to shake things up, I understand that. \"But what I cannot understand is why anyone would think Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Matt Rourke) Elon Musk is being sued by Philadelphia's district attorney over his $US1million daily election giveaways. It is the first lawsuit brought over the sweepstakes, run by Mr Musk and his America PAC in an attempt to boost Donald Trump's campaign. When asked about the lawsuit, Mr Musk's company responded with a link to a post on X showing the latest winner holding a cheque for a million dollars. Elon Musk is being sued by Philadelphia's district attorney over his $US1 million ($1.5m) giveaways in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. It is the first legal action to be brought over the billionaire tech mogul's America PAC and the sweepstakes offering $US1m every day until election day next week. The office of Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner said it was acting because it had the responsibility to protect the public from interference with the integrity of the election. \"The Philadelphia District Attorney is charged with protecting the public from public nuisances and unfair trade practices, including illegal lotteries,\" Mr Krasner's office said in a statement published on its website. A spokesperson for Mr Musk's America PAC, who was emailed for comment, responded with a link to an X post, which showed the latest winner holding an oversized cheque. Election law experts previously questioned whether the cheques could violate federal law, which bars anyone from paying a person to vote or register to vote. However, the lawsuit makes clear that it is not about vote-buying. Instead, the district attorney says, the case centres on running a lottery. \"This case is very simple because America PAC and Musk are indisputably violating Pennsylvania's statutory prohibitions against illegal lotteries and deceiving consumers,\" the suit states. Speaking in Delaware after casting his ballot on Monday, local time, President Joe Biden called the giveaway \"totally inappropriate\". But people attending Mr Musk's events have a different view. Michele Costantino, 64, a retired Pennsylvanian health care administrator, said she thought the giveaway was a \"good idea\". \"I think he's playing the same game as the other side,\" she said outside a Musk rally on Saturday. \"If you need to flash some big money to get people's attention, I think it's a good idea.\" The giveaway requires entrants to sign a petition backing the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution and calls for them to serve as spokespeople for the organisation as a condition of winning. Mr Musk has gone all in on Trump this election, saying he thinks civilisation is at stake if he loses.  He has committed more than $US70 million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in November.

This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In Tuesday's wrap, we take a look at the backlash from Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, arson attacks on ballot boxes and how much Americans really trust their election process. Let's get into it. The Trump campaign has issued a statement distancing itself from comments about Puerto Rico made at the former president's Madison Square Garden rally. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, speaking before Donald Trump took to the stage, labelled the US territory as a \"floating island of garbage\". \"The people in the room were really happy … There was a happiness in there. I think the press is like, 'Oh, it was negative.' Oh, come on.\" — Fox News host Laura Ingraham, on Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. The comments, along with other racist and sexist remarks made by other speakers, sparked backlash from Puerto Rican celebrities, politicians and others. Among those were rapper Bad Bunny, singer Ricky Martin and actress Jennifer Lopez. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, on a live-stream with congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, labelled Mr Hinchcliffe \"a jack-wad\". \"People in Puerto Rico are citizens,\" he said. \"They pay taxes and serve in the military at almost a higher rate than anybody else.\" Ms Ocasio-Cortez, whose parents are Puerto Rican, told the more than 12,000 people watching: \"I need people to understand … that's what they think about you. \"It's what they think of anyone who makes less money than them. It's what they think about people who serve them food in a restaurant. It's what they think about people who fold their clothes in a store. Dude, are you serious?\" While Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and its citizens are not able to vote in the election, there are large Puerto Rican populations in several key states, including Pennsylvania. Puerto Ricans who live in the United States are eligible to vote, and both campaigns have made an effort to target the almost six-million strong community. Young American men have traditionally skewed Democrat, but there's evidence Donald Trump is turning the tables. In Pennsylvania, the sizeable Puerto Rican community is large enough to tip the state one way or the other — potentially impacting the election outcome. A senior adviser to the Trump campaign said in a statement the joke \"does not reflect the views of president Trump or the campaign.\" Mr Trump's vice-presidential pick JD Vance said while the comment \"maybe [was] a stupid, racist joke\", Americans needed to \"stop getting so offended\". According to CNN, the rally's speeches were largely read from a teleprompter and were meant to be vetted by campaign staff beforehand. New York Republican congressman Anthony D'Esposito, who is Puerto Rican, said on social media he was proud of his heritage. \"It's a beautiful island with a rich culture and an integral part of the USA,\" he said. \"The only thing that's 'garbage' was a bad comedy set. Stay on message.\" Police are investigating after two apparent arson attacks on ballot drop boxes in separate US states. A ballot box in Portland, Oregon, was set alight at 3.30am on Monday local time, after \"an incendiary device\" was put inside. An hour later, a ballot box in Vancouver, Washington, also caught fire, destroying hundreds of ballots. Police say a suspicious device was found next to the box. In the Portland fire, the blaze triggered powdered fire suppressant canisters inside, protecting almost all ballots. Election officials have called on those who voted after a certain time to submit a replacement ballot, which would be checked against the electoral role to prevent any double-ups. A Portland Police Bureau spokesperson said a \"suspect vehicle\" had been identified via security footage. It's believed the attacks could be linked. The FBI is investigating both incidents. It follows another arson attack at a Phoenix postal collection box last week. President Joe Biden cast his vote at a polling booth in Delaware. (Reuters: Craig Hudson) President Joe Biden stood in line with dozens of early voters in Delaware to cast his ballot for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, his current vice-president. Given just a few months ago he had been vying for a second term himself, he was asked whether the moment was bittersweet. \"No, this is just sweet,\" he told media. More than 75 per cent of voters surveyed say American democracy is under threat, according to a new poll by the New York Times and Siena College. The research institute surveyed 2,516 voters across the US between October 20 to 23. Almost half of those surveyed also said American democracy did not do a \"good job representing the people\". A further 62 per cent said the government was mostly working to benefit itself and elites, rather than the common good.

It's a swing county within a swing state that voted for Barack Obama twice, then Donald Trump, then Joe Biden. Since 1912 the county has correctly swung with the nation all but three times: In 1968 when Richard Nixon won office and then 2000 and 2004 when Republican president George W Bush defeated Al Gore and then John Kerry. This election is incredibly tight with both Kamala Harris and Trump making late efforts to sway voters at rallies just days out from the November 5 vote. The latest New York Times/Siena poll has voters across the nation split at 48 per cent when it comes to their preferred president. Former steelworker Don Young is now one of the guides at Bethlehem Steel after it became a tourist attraction.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) In the shadow of the rusted towers and pipes of Bethlehem Steel 87-year-old former steelworker and registered Republican Don Young tells 7.30 why he will once again be voting against that party. \"My vote for Kamala Harris is simply based on that she is not Donald Trump, and with Kamala Harris, I expect the democratic traditions of the country to be continued,\" Mr Young said. \"Donald Trump — I fear he is going to wreck the democratic United States government.\" Mr Young says Trump \"preaches a rosy future without any real statistics or plans to back it up\". The tight race in Northampton County has exposed divisions between neighbours, colleagues and even within households, including Don Young's. \"My wife is an ardent, ardent Trump supporter. She really looks at Trump as the orange Jesus, the saviour of the nation. And I have to live with her. But, she's a fine woman.\" Donald Trump's rhetoric and politics have been dividing Americans as the US election draws nearer. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) In nearby Allentown, the poll has caused problems in Gary Ward's household too. He's voting for Trump, and he and his wife fell out over her lawn signs supporting the Democrats. \"The vibe is not good. That's why I just can't wait until this election is over and we can get back to being, you know, a friendly husband and wife,\" Mr Ward told 7.30. \"It's just, I'm surprised, the first time in our over 50-year marriage where an election has actually impacted the way we're treating each other.\" Mr Ward sells oriental carpets from an Allentown warehouse and thinks Trump is better placed to fix America's soaring cost of living. Gary Ward considers himself independent and plans on voting for Donald Trump next week. (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"I do like him because like me, he's a business guy, and I believe that he's is not as insulated as … career politicians are,\" he said. \"He knows about profit and loss, and I believe if this country were run more like a business that we could bring things in or rein things in, like inflation, and solve problems like the border issue.\" To vote for Trump he will put aside his personal dislike of the former president. \"When I pull that lever or mark my ballot, I'm going to be holding my nose literally, because I want to demonstrate that I'm not really happy with whom I'm voting for,\" he said. \"I'm all over his policies, but I don't like the guy.\" Mr Ward's colleague, office manager Kathy Skrapits, can't fathom why so many here, including her employer, Gary, are voting for Trump. \"Most of my friends are Democrats and will vote that way. We all kind of feel, and this is horrible to say, but we're voting for the lesser of two evils,\" she said. \"I will not vote for a convicted felon. I will not vote for someone who has taken my daughter's choice away.\" Ms Skrapits said she has a friend, a nurse, who had an ectopic pregnancy and survived thanks to emergency surgery that is now illegal in some US states. Abortion rights are a key issue for Kathy Skrapits.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"Had she been in a state where it was across the board no abortion, she would have died,\" she said. \"She was bleeding out as she was driving. \"It's too important to not take it seriously enough. And I do, and for that reason, I will vote for Kamala Harris.\" Ms Skrapits says she cannot believe that people will still vote for Trump after he was found guilty of falsifying business records at a criminal trial in May. \"He's not a good person,\" she said. \"He's a felon, 34 counts, convicted felon. He could be running the country from prison. \"Isn't that funny? Not in a 'haha' kind of way, either. Kind of mind-blowing that there are such smart people who will still vote for him.\" One of those smart people who will vote for Donald Trump is emergency room doctor Jim Sweetland. For most of his adult life, Dr Sweetland has voted for the Democrats. His politics shifted over the Affordable Care Act — better known as Obamacare — which he called a \"tax\" rather than healthcare reform. Dr Jim Sweetland is an emergency room doctor and former Democrat voter.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"Somebody has to pay for that in the United States [and] that's the middle class. So they're paying it indirectly, through higher premiums for their health care insurance,\" Dr Sweetland told 7.30. He says he didn't abandon the Democrats — the Democrats left him. \"I was the youngest of five kids, and I was lucky enough to get through school to become a physician,\" he said. \"I think everybody has the opportunity to achieve in the United States, and I don't think the Democratic Party is into that anymore. It's more a Republican issue.\" In July Dr Sweetland's political transformation led him to a Donald Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he sat with his wife Lois in the crowd behind the former president. A few minutes into Trump's speech, Dr Sweetland heard the pop of gunshots and watched Trump get buried under a scrum of Secret Service agents. It was clear that someone in the crowd had been injured too. Dr Sweetland was in the crowd at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where an attempted assassination took place.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Dr Sweetland recounted the event: \"I heard a woman say very loudly, 'He's been shot. He's down', which, in EMS lingo, is 'This person's seriously ill, come now\". Dr Sweetland clambered through the crowd and found an injured man who'd fallen between the rows of seats, later, he'd discover it was firefighter Corey Comperatore, 50. \"He's a big guy, and I couldn't lift him,\" Dr Sweetland said. Another bystander helped pick him up and lay him on a bench, where Dr Sweetland performed CPR until emergency services arrived. Comperatore's wife Helen was beside Dr Sweetland as he continued resuscitation efforts. Four months on, he remains affected by the events of the day, where Comperatore died. Corey Comperatore, pictured here with his daughter, was killed in the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.  (Image: GoFundMe) \"The look on her face I'll never forget, and for many, for more than a few months, it's woken me up at night, but the look on her face was that of sheer shock and horror, but also a little bit of hope.\" Dr Sweetland says he has sought out counselling since the rally. Since the shooting, Dr Sweetland has spoken at Trump events. \"I've given speeches, and I always end it by saying, we as Americans need to turn down the temperature in the room, and we can do that by doing just this, call up somebody that you know that doesn't have the same political view that you have, and just say, I want to speak with you in a respectful manner.\" Turning down the temperature is not something the often inflammatory former president is renowned for, which Dr Sweetland acknowledges, while saying the Democrats are also guilty of being intemperate. \"He's bombastic in certain ways,\" he told 7.30. \"There's not — and I love the man — but he does not have a filter from his brain to his mouth. \"So a lot of things have come out unfiltered, and that's his downfall, I think, as well as his strength. \"Americans can trust him. He just said something I wouldn't have said, but I know what he's thinking. And when he says he's going to do something like in his first administration, he did it.\" Watch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV Do you know more about this story?

(ABC News: Brad Ryan) It's Sunday afternoon in Penn Township – a quiet, and almost exclusively white, outer suburb of Pittsburgh.  Church has finished for the day, and a group of Republicans is meeting in a car park outside a community bank. \"This is just the most critical election of our lifetime, and we really need president Trump back in office to save our country,\" says Beverly Ronallo, one of the gathered party faithful. This group knows America's voting system means their state of Pennsylvania could make or break the election for Donald Trump. Polls here have been incredibly tight for weeks, but have shifted ever-so-slightly in Trump's favour in the past fortnight. The FiveThirtyEight polling average for Pennsylvania, calculated off a range of state and national polls, had Kamala Harris slightly ahead of Trump until 10 days ago.  As of Tuesday (local time), it shows Trump ahead, 47.9 per cent to 47.7 per cent. Some doors in Penn Township don't need to be knocked on. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"We really need a businessman to get in there and straighten out the economy,\" Beverly says. \"Get us back to four or five years ago. When president Trump was in office, everything was so much more affordable.\" The Republicans used public voting records to create a database of so-called \"weak Republicans\" in the area, and they're determined to knock on as many of their doors as possible. \"Usually, their argument is that Donald Trump is mean or Donald Trump tweets mean stuff, and that's pretty much it – that he's not a nice person,\" Beverly says. \"But I'm not taking him home at night. I mean, I just want my country safe, and my social security to be safe, and to get a balanced budget somehow.\" Weak Republicans are defined as those who are registered with the party, but have failed to vote in some recent elections. They're not hard to find – voters' names, addresses, party affiliations and turnout records are all freely available. America makes voter information publicly available, so canvassing can be targeted. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) And a high turnout of \"weak\" Republicans could give Trump a win in Pennsylvania, which he won in 2016 by 0.72 per cent, but lost to Joe Biden in 2020 by 1.17 per cent. Beverly, who lives in Penn Township, hasn't travelled far from home in her efforts to get out the vote. It's a different story for Jeanne Mendez. After she lost her husband 20 years ago, Jeanne quit her job at Microsoft, packed her bags, and moved from Seattle to rural Guatemala. \"My husband was only 55 when he died, and it was a real slap across the head to say: 'Wake up, don't waste your life,'\" she says.  But now, after some friends chipped in to cover her flights and an Airbnb in Pennsylvania, she's returned from Central America with a mission. \"I am terrified about the thought of Donald Trump,\" she says. \"Democracy is at stake. I truly believe it.\" Jeanne Mendez is volunteering for the Democrats in Pittsburgh. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) She's volunteering with the Allegheny County Democrats, at the party's headquarters in an old bank building over the river from downtown Pittsburgh. Many of her fellow volunteers have flown into Pennsylvania from other parts of the US, because volunteering in their home states would likely be a wasted effort. That's because almost every state awards all its \"electoral college\" votes to the presidential candidate who wins that state. The runner-up candidate is awarded no electoral college votes, even if a sizeable share of the state's voters selected them. Most states reliably vote Republican or Democrat, and are unlikely to flip at this election. Only seven states have a competitive race: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and – the largest, with the most votes up for grabs – Pennsylvania. The Allegheny County Democratic Committee volunteers, in Pittsburgh, operate separately to the Harris-Walz campaign.  Rather than persuading people how to vote, they've been focused on making sure registered Democrats remember to vote, by sending postcards, making phone calls, and encouraging them to vote by mail.  Some are now driving around Pittsburgh to get voters to where they need to be. Volunteers at Allegheny County Democrats HQ in Pittsburgh. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"A lot of us are getting people on the phone who applied for mail-in ballots but haven't gotten them,\" Jeanne says.  \"And so we're saying: 'OK, you know what? We have drivers here. We can take you to the polls today'.\" Pennsylvania is part of the so-called \"blue wall\", as well as fellow swing states Michigan and Wisconsin.  Winning the \"blue wall\", as Biden did in 2020, is widely seen as the most likely path to victory for Harris.  \"If Harris wins the three blue wall states, she probably (although not certainly) wins,\" prominent pollster and political forecaster Nate Silver wrote at the weekend. \"If Trump does, it doesn't technically clinch the White House for him, but it probably does for all practical purposes — Harris would have to sweep all the other battlegrounds.\" And, according to NBC News, a Harris campaign memo has identified Pennsylvania's suburbs as \"our own mini 'blue wall'\".  \"The Harris campaign's path to win Pennsylvania capitalises on Trump's unprecedented weakness in the suburbs,\" the memo says. Like the Republicans, Democrats are focusing their eleventh-hour canvassing efforts on visiting the homes of people on their own team. But some, like Debbie Turici, were knocking on Republicans' doors until recently. Debbie Turici (left) speaks to a voter in Findlay Township, a suburb in Pittsburgh. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) She says she's encountered a few who have switched their support to the Democrats since Trump's ascent in the party.  One registered Republican even handed her a hundred-dollar note when she put herself forward as a Democratic candidate in a state race two years ago. The retired art teacher was motivated to become more politically active, in part, by mass shootings in American schools. \"As a teacher, you know, it was fire drills – then all of a sudden, we're doing active shooting drills,\" she says.  \"When Sandy Hook happened, I was just devastated – cried like a baby. And now, we've become so immune to it.\" It's not just Democrats encountering Republicans who are switching sides. Valerie Frick is helping to run a \"GOP Victory Centre\" in Murrysville – a community of 20,000 in the rolling hills east of Pittsburgh. The highway shopfront was set up by local Republicans to help get local Trump supporters signed up to vote. \"It's not unusual to have 20 people a day come in and want to check their registration, or register,\" says Valerie. Valerie Frick says she's personally helped seven Democrats switch sides. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) \"We've also had people that have changed from Democrats to Republicans, and then we honour them and clap and take their picture, and we give them a little flag.\" Valerie says she's personally helped seven visitors switch their party registration. Fellow volunteers have helped others. \"Mostly it's the economy – they'd like to see prices go down the way they were with Donald Trump in office,\" she says. \"A lot of it is the right to life too – even women coming in and using that for a reason.\" The centre is also selling Trump merchandise to raise cash for the party. Trump merchandise is for sale at the GOP Victory Centre in Murrysville. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) When the ABC visits, a local woman and her daughter-in-law also stop in. \"I've driven past a bunch of times and just wanted to come in and buy something,\" the younger woman says.  She lives on a street that some of her neighbours call \"Liberal Lane\", because of the number of Harris-Walz yard signs.  The women ask not to have their names published. \"When you say you're for Trump, everyone looks down on you,\" the older woman says.  They've decided not to take yard signs, but the younger woman picks up a stubby holder and some wristbands. \"Just something little,\" she says. \"And something we can also pack away.

(Reuters: Hannah McKay) Good afternoon and welcome back to another day on the presidential campaign trail. This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In Wednesday's wrap, we take a look at Kamala Harris' rally in Washington, Steve Bannon's release from federal prison and data showing what Americans think about Donald Trump and democracy. Let's get into it. Vice-President Kamala Harris has delivered her closing speech at a rally in Washington DC, pledging to \"put country above party and above self\". \"We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict and confusion.\" — Kamala Harris speaking at a rally in Washington DC Supporters gathered at the Ellipse near the White House — the same place Donald Trump held a rally with a crowd who went on to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \"We know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people,\" Ms Harris said. Her campaign said more than 75,000 people turned out to listen to the Democratic presidential candidate who said Trump was seeking \"unchecked power\". She said Trump was a \"petty tyrant\" and \"wannabe dictator\" who wasn't focused on making life better for Americans.  Ms Harris listed her key policy goals, including expanding Medicare coverage for home health care, increasing the supply of housing and restoring nationwide access to abortion.  \"On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.\" Trump's ally Steve Bannon has been released from federal prison after serving a four-month sentence for contempt of US Congress. In 2022, Bannon was found guilty of refusing to sit before the January 6 House Committee investigating the US Capitol attack after Joe Biden's election victory in 2020. The former Trump adviser was also found guilty of refusing to provide documents related to his involvement with Trump's effort to overturn the election. Donald Trump is under fire over comments a comedian made about Puerto Rico at a New York rally. But so far he has not acknowledged the anger and hurt that members of the community feel despite courting their votes in a must-win state. Soon after leaving a low-security prison in Connecticut, Bannon appeared at a Manhattan media event and declared: \"I'm finally out of being a political prisoner\".  \"I think you can see today I'm far from broken. I've been empowered by my four months in Danbury federal prison,\" he said.  Bannon was a key adviser to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was his chief White House strategist in 2017 before they had a falling out. He told reporters he spoke to Trump on Tuesday morning, local time, and repeated his unsubstantiated claim that the 2020 election was \"stolen\". Bannon was facing criminal charges in New York state for allegedly duping donors who gave money to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. With just seven days to go until the election, both presidential candidates have been crisscrossing the US trying to win as many votes as they can. Much of the campaigning over the past three days has been focused around the key swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Paulyne Morgan White says she will vote on election day. (Reuters: Kevin Wurm) In July 1964, the US passed the Civil Rights Act that prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex or national origin at places serving the public. Sixty years since the law passed, Reuters spoke to Black voters who lived under Jim Crow laws to get their views on this year's presidential election. \"I’m going to vote on voting day,\" said Paulyne Morgan White, 95, from Atlanta, Georgia. \"I like the activity. And I don't have to wait in line.\" Supporters of both Trump and Harris are equally likely to believe American democracy is under threat, according to a poll by the New York Times and Siena College.  The research institute surveyed 2,516 voters across the US between October 20 to 23. The poll also showed many voters did not believe Trump was serious when he said he would use the military on \"the enemy from within\".  ABC/Wires Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

The Trump campaign is headed to Allentown, Pennsylvania, while Harris is headed to the Ellipse in Washington to deliver her closing argument.  Look back on that happened here.  By Tessa Flemming  Thanks for joining us on the campaign trail today. We'll resume our live coverage of the US election tomorrow morning. In the meantime, you can read our daily wrap of the campaign events below. Enjoy the rest of your day! By Tessa Flemming  Here's a quick update from New York Times journalist Mike Baker about the burnt ballots found in Clark County, Washington.  For a refresher, police are investigating two apparent arson attacks on ballot drop boxes in separate US states. In Washington, the attacks destroyed hundreds of ballots, and police say a suspicious device was found next to the box. Now, election officials say they are drying out remaining ballots and working to identify who hasn't yet sought a replacement ballot. Police say a second ballot box in Portland, Oregon, was set alight at 3.30am on Monday local time, after \"an incendiary device\" was put inside. By Brianna Morris-Grant Former Trump rival Nikki Haley says she's \"on standby\" to campaign for the former president. Ms Haley was the last one standing in the fight against Donald Trump to become the Republican nominee earlier this year. In an interview with Fox News earlier today she criticised the Trump campaign, noting comments about women and Puerto Rico would make voters \"uncomfortable\". She said she had last spoken to Mr Trump in June but denied any \"bad blood\" between them. \"They are very aware that we are on standby,\" she said. \"They know that we would be there to help ... We are on the same team. \"It is their campaign's decision on what he needs in these last final days. It does not bother me at all.\" By Tessa Flemming  Barbara Bush, the daughter of George W Bush and granddaughter of George HW Bush, has given a surprise  Kamala Harris endorsement. According to a People exclusive, Barbara was campaigning for Ms Harris in Pennsylvania, with hopes the Democratic nominee could \"move our country forward and protect women's rights.\" Barbara's Republican father served as president from 2001 to 2009. Her mother, Laura Bush, broke from the party's stance on same-sex marriage and abortion in 2010. By Tessa Flemming  It may seem like an act of self-inflicted torture but these drag queens are high-heel racing in the name of supporting Kamala Harris. The queens donned their best frocks for the annual high heel race in Washington, DC. From attendees dressed as \"childless cat ladies\" to full Harris-Walz costuming, the affair was particularly politically-charged ahead of November 5. By Elissa Steedman When Trump was president, he installed 3 new, pro-republican supreme court judges.\nCan Biden, or Harris, counter that move by installing 3 pro-democrat judges? Or, why not 4? - Ray It's not so simple. The US Supreme Court has nine members at a time: one chief justice and eight associate justices. These justices hold their offices under a life tenure, which means vacancies in the Supreme Court don't come up all that often. That only happens if a justice retires, dies or is impeached. Even if Harris is elected this year and re-elected in 2028, it's possible she may not get a chance to influence the Supreme Court at all. By Brianna Morris-Grant Robert F Kennedy Jr claimes that if Donald Trump is elected he will be given control of multiple public health agencies. Among those, he says, are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institute of Health and the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr Kennedy, who dropped out of the race to support Mr Trump, has been an anti-vaccination activist for more than a decade. At his Madison Square Garden rally earlier this week, Mr Trump said he would let Mr Kennedy \"go wild\" if elected.  By Tessa Flemming  In a further sign Trump and his campaign is distancing itself from the comments of comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, the Republican nominee now has acknowledged \"somebody said some bad things\". Trump was speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity when he further reiterated he had \"no idea\" who Hinchcliffe was. In his warm up act at Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, the comedian described Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage\". Trump acknowledged that \"somebody said some bad things\" that night but tried to downplay concerns about insulting a critical voting bloc. \"They put a comedian in, which everybody does — you throw comedians in, you don't vet them and go crazy. It's nobody's fault,\" he said. \"But somebody said some bad things. \"Now, what they've done is taken somebody that has nothing to do with the party, has nothing to do with us, said something, and they try and make a big deal.\" The Trump campaign earlier sought to distance itself from the comments, saying they did not reflect the former president's views. Trump has since told American ABC he didn't know the comedian or hear the joke as it was made. Reporting with AP  By Tessa Flemming  Thousands of people gathered in Washington to attend Kamala Harris' biggest rally. Ahead of the event, people were seen lining the streets and estimates by her campaign say more than than 75,000 people attended. By Tessa Flemming  Partial passwords belonging to some Colorado voting systems that were accidentally posted online will pose no threat to the election, the state department says. It says a spreadsheet located on its website \"improperly\" included a hidden tab that included the fragments of the passwords. \"This does not pose an immediate security threat to Colorado's elections, nor will it impact how ballots are counted,\" it said. The department says it took immediate action and informed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). A CISA spokesperson it was aware of the incident. Hope Scheppelman, the vice-chair of the state's Republican Party, said more than 600 passwords for voting systems in 63 of Colorado's 64 counties were shared on the website. She said the passwords were not encrypted and they were posted since at least August. Ms Scheppelman released an affidavit of a person claiming to have accessed the passwords from August 8 to October. 23. Reuters was not able to independently verify this affidavit. Reporting with Reuters  By Brianna Morris-Grant The man who broke into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer has been sentenced to life in prison. David DePape, 44, was already serving a 30-year sentence for federal crimes relating to the 2022 attack. In June he was convicted of several state offences, including aggavated kidnapping and false impisonment of an elder. Paul Pelosi, then 82, was forced to undergo surgery for two skull fractures following the incident. In a letter to the judge, Mr Pelosi said his \"last peaceful sleep\" was the night before DePape broke into his bedroom. He told the judge that \"not a day goes by that we do not think of this devastating assault, its trauma — or the possibility of future attacks\". By Tessa Flemming  More on that debated 'garbage' comment from Mr Biden. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who's backed Kamala Harris, says he wouldn't have called supporters of Trump \"garbage\". For context,  Joe Biden has denied this and the White House is trying to argue the president meant the demonisation of Latinos was garbage, not Trump's supporters. CNN showed Mr Shapiro that video of Mr Biden and then asked for his response. \"I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn't support,\" Mr Shapiro replied. Reporting with AP  By Brianna Morris-Grant Former first lady Michelle Obama has warned against \"disillusionment and apathy\" at a campaign event in Georgia. \"It's natural to wonder if anyone hears you, if anyone sees you,\" she told the crowd in College Park. \"It's our job to show folks that two things can be true at once. \"That it is possible to be outraged by the slow pace of progress and be committed to your own pursuit of that progress.\" Ms Obama was joined on-stage at the formally non-partisan evnet by singers Ciara and Victoria Monét. Actress Kerry Washington and Shonda Rhimes, showrunner for Grey's Anatomy and Bridgerton, were also present. By Jade Macmillan Donald Trump's campaign has seized on a video in which Joe Biden appears to describe the former president's supporters as \"garbage\". It's the same word that has attracted so much controversy after comedian Tony Hinchliffe used it in a joke about Puerto Rico at Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally. This is how an official White House transcript characterised what the president said, as he was speaking to a Latino voting group about Hinchliffe's remarks. \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American,\" the transcript reads. Note the placement of the apostrophe in the word \"supporter's\". The White House is trying to argue that the president meant the demonisation of Latinos was garbage, not Trump's supporters. Biden took to social media to try to reinforce that point. But Trump's campaign isn't buying it, comparing the comment to Hillary Clinton's infamous \"basket of deplorables\" remark in 2016. \"There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him,\" campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. We're yet to see a response from the Harris team. By Brianna Morris-Grant Even though today's speeches were penned as \"closing arguments\", there's still a full week of campaigning left before voting day. Tomorrow (Wednesday, local time) Donald Trump will hold two rallies, one in North Carolina and another in Wisconsin. There will be more rallies in other states in the days that follow. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, will head to a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina in a few hours. She also has two campaign events on Wednesday in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. By Elissa Steedman Do we know who has the lead in this election? - Jim It's really too close to say. We could look at national poll averages, which show Kamala Harris has about a small 1.4-point lead over Donald Trump. But national polls are famously not the best gauge at who will go on to win the election. A big reason for that is because who becomes the next president isn't as simple as who gets the most votes. That was made obvious as recently as the 2016 election, where millions more people voted for Hillary Clinton but Trump became president. It comes down to where the votes are won, thanks to the Electoral College.  This clip from Planet America has some more information about how that works. So even if Harris appears to have more support, it won't get her across the line if those voters are concentrated in only a few states (like California and New York). If we take a look at poll averages in the seven battleground states at this election (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), the race is neck-and-neck. By Elissa Steedman The Supreme Court has denied a bid by former independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr to be removed from ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.  Kennedy dropped out of the race and endorsed Donald Trump in August but his name will still appear on ballots. The court denied Kennedy's emergency requests to order the Wisconsin Electoral Commission and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to take him off the ballot in those states. The environmental lawyer argued state officials were violating the First Amendment protection against government infringement of speech by forcing him to remain on the ballot after he sought to be removed. In Wisconsin, state law does not allow for withdrawal once a nominee has qualified for the ballot, as Kennedy had. The Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed in September with a trial court's decision against Kennedy. Kennedy suggested Wisconsin officials \"cover his name with stickers\" on the ballot. The commission told the Supreme Court, \"the absurdity of this proposal is evident on its face\". In Michigan, Benson rejected Kennedy's requests to withdraw from the ballot, prompting him to sue in state court. The Michigan Supreme Court ruled against him in September. Reporting with Reuters By Brianna Morris-Grant President Joe Biden met with voters and visited a marine terminal in Baltimore earlier today. The visit was to announce a $US3 billion ($4.58 billion) investment to improve port infrastructure and create union jobs. By Brianna Morris-Grant Trump supporters are voting to stop \"the most sinister and corrupt forces on Earth\", Donald Trump tells the crowd. In his final remarks, he tells his supporters November 5 is the most important day in the nation's history. \"After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the greatest four years in American history,\" he says. \"We will restore America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. \"We are one people, one family, one glorious nation under God. \"We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down and we will never, ever surrender. \"Together we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win.\" After almost 90 minutes on stage, he is leaving the stage — to the song YMCA by the Village People. By Brianna Morris-Grant Donald Trump tells supporters October 7 \"never would have happened\". He also promises to \"prevent World War 3\" if elected next week. \"I will stop the chaos in the Middle East, October 7 would have never happened,\" he says. \"I will prevent World War 3 very easily, I will prevent it, I know everybody, I know all the players. \"We can't have World War 3, we have very, very, very stupid people running our country.\" He promises to \"strengthen and modernise\" law enforcement and the military, while building the US its own Iron Dome. To cheers from the crowd, he says he will remove \"critical race theory\" and transgender rights, and make it illegal to burn an American flag.

(Reuters: Brendan Smialowski/Pool) Kamala Harris has attempted to distance herself from Joe Biden's comments about Donald Trump's supporters, which have attracted backlash in the final days of the campaign. \"He clarified his comments,\" Ms Harris said on Wednesday, local time. \"But let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.\" On Tuesday, the president was condemning a joke made by a comedian at a recent Trump rally when he appeared to describe the former president's supporters as \"garbage\". The White House argues Mr Biden was referring to \"hateful rhetoric\" and not the supporters themselves.  The Trump campaign has seized on the remarks. The vice-president has tried to limit the damage to her own campaign. \"You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career,\" Ms Harris told reporters as she prepared to board a flight for a campaign event in North Carolina. \"I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not. \"And as president the United States, I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not.\" Asked if she had spoken to Mr Biden about his comments, Ms Harris said: \"He did call me last night but this didn't come up.\" At a Harris rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, some attendees said Mr Biden's comment was unhelpful. \"That was a terrible statement,\" said Justin Warren. \"It could have been a slip or a gaffe on his part. \"For those who are actually supporting Trump, I get it, I understand, but I think they're misguided.\" (Left to right) Beth Kanagy, Justin Warren and Mia Caldonetti attended a Harris rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Mia Caldonetti said she believed the vice-president wanted to \"separate herself\" from the president and prove she would be her own leader. \"Last week she was on a Fox News interview where she, as she's repeatedly said, she will never insult the American people. \"And I think that getting that out to their viewers, mainly Trump supporters, they'll understand that that's not Kamala Harris.\" With a week until election day, and a 0.2 per cent margin in the polls, the grassroots ground game in America's most high-stakes state is seeing some shifts in strategy. Beth Kanagy said she was tired of the vitriol she'd been hearing generally during the campaign. \"It's not how we should be as a people,\" she said. \"But the president can say what he wants – we all have the first amendment, he can say what he wants, and he was pushing back on what he was hearing.\" The former president used his own rally in North Carolina to hit back.   \"Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters. He called them garbage,\" Trump said, as the crowd booed.  \"And they mean it, even though, without question, my supporters are far higher quality than crooked Joe or lyin' Kamala.\" Mr Biden made the comments during a Zoom call with grassroots get-out-the-vote group Voto Latino. He was referring to a joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in New York on Sunday. Hinchcliffe said: \"There's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico.\" According to the official White House transcription of his comments, Mr Biden said: \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.\" Mr Biden later tweeted:  \"Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.\" Trump's campaign argues Mr Biden was clearly calling Trump's supporters \"garbage\". It's made comparisons to a comment made by Trump's 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton, when she referred to some of his supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". Trump has also said he had \"no idea\" who the comedian was. \"They put a comedian in, which everybody does — you throw comedians in, you don't vet them and go crazy. It's nobody's fault,\" he told Fox News. Both Ms Harris and Trump are campaigning in multiple key states on Wednesday in the final sprint to the November 5 election.

The state capital of Raleigh is more than 2,400 kilometres from the US/Mexico border. Despite that distance, in semi-rural Rockingham County, near the city of Greensboro, that message is delivered by Sheriff Sam Page, a Republican and a campaigner against immigration at the border. He says an uncontrolled border is bringing crime to North Carolina; he has also personally been lauded by Donald Trump. Sheriff Sam Page believes in Donald Trump as president. (Supplied.) \"[An uncontrolled border] brings criminal activity, brings drugs. brings human trafficking,\" Sheriff Page told 7.30. \"And one of the biggest points that I've seen ignored over the past several months in this past administration is the Mexican drug cartels.\" Sheriff Page says the cartels have even made it to Rockingham County, with its sedate main street and skyline dominated by the long-defunct Lucky Strike cigarette factory. Sheriff Sam Page says the cartels have made it to Rockingham County. (ABC News: Craig Hansen ) \"Don't kid yourself. They're here,\" he said. \"If a person is selling those drugs, the methamphetamines, the heroin, the fentanyl, any of the cocaine, any they're selling those products, they're working for the cartel.\" Synthetic opioid fentanyl is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of 107,000 people in the United States last year, and around 3,500 people in North Carolina alone. It's much stronger than heroin, and a tiny dose can be fatal. Fentanyl killed Barbara Walsh's 24-year-old daughter, Sophia, in 2021. She drank from a bottle that she did not know had been laced with the drug. Sophia Walsh lost her life after accidentally ingesting fentanyl. (Supplied) Barbara Walsh now campaigns to educate people about the toxicity of the drug, and is pushing to have the antidote naloxone introduced to the state's schools. \"No one is safe from fentanyl,\" Ms Walsh said. \"Fentanyl does not discriminate. It kills rich people, it kills poor people. It doesn't care what colour you are, or what gender you are, or your intelligence, how much schooling you have.\" She agrees that fentanyl has become a politicised issue — but is careful not to take sides in the highly-charged argument about who is to blame for the drug being brought into the US. \"We need political solutions, we need policy solutions, we need education solutions,\" Ms Walsh told 7.30. Barbara's daughter died after she drank from a bottle that was laced with fentanyl. (ABC News: Craig Hansen ) \"We need prevention solutions, and politics can help or hurt. And right now, I would like to see politics involved to help.\" North Carolina has around 300,000 undocumented migrants, but there's no evidence that they're responsible for the importation of fentanyl to the area. Most migrants come to North Carolina to work in low-paying jobs, like agricultural labouring and criminologists say undocumented migrants are no more likely to be involved in violent crime than US citizens. Barbara Walsh is pushing to have naloxone introduced to the state's schools. (ABC News: Craig Hansen ) Ninety-four per cent of agricultural labourers in the US are Spanish speaking and it's estimated that 53 per cent of farm workers are undocumented. But the language used by Donald Trump and his campaign conflates migrants with crime and fentanyl. \"Millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers and drugs coming into our country, our country has gone to hell,\" declares one advertisement. \"Kamala won't change a thing so Americans will continue to lose their lives,\" says another. Iliana Santillan, who came to the US from Mexico as a child, told 7.30 that language is affecting the migrants already living in North Carolina. Iliana Santillan says many in her community are terrified of the language being used by Donald Trump and his supporters. (ABC News: Craig Hansen ) \"When you see our community, and you see their faces, and you see the children and the mums and the families and the workers, and it's just like, I can't imagine people thinking those things about the same community we are,\" Ms Santillan said. Ms Santillan herself became an illegal immigrant when her family overstayed its visa. She is now a US citizen and works with North Carolina's Latino community, many of whom are terrified of the language being used by Trump and his supporters. She says they're worried about a repeat of deportations carried out in North Carolina during the last Trump administration. Raleigh, the state capital of North Carolina. (ABC News: Craig Hansen ) \"I think the general sentiment is very, very scary, and we hope that doesn't happen again, but we've seen deportations and raids at this scale in our state happen under a Trump administration,\" she said. Undocumented migrants have a difficult life in the US. They're not covered by health insurance, they're confined to low-wage, cash jobs, they can't travel home to see relatives, and they can't obtain a driver's licence — which puts them at risk of arrest every time they drive. Edith Percastigui has lived for 23 years in the US as an undocumented immigrant. She's spent her life here working low-paid jobs like fruit picking. Her two sons were born here — so they are US citizens and cannot be deported — but Edith worries about Trump's vows to start rounding up illegal immigrants. \"It's just scary to think that people could get deported and things could get worse,\" she said.

This is our daily wrap, making sure you're caught up on the latest election developments. In this wrap, we take a look at how Kamala Harris is handling President Joe Biden's \"garbage\" gaffe, violence at the polling booths and multiple lawsuits in Pennsylvania. Let's get into it. Vice-President Kamala Harris has said she \"strongly\" disagrees with criticising people based on who they vote for. \"Donald Trump wants us to be cynical. We've always been a great country. And what I worry most about is that people lose faith in it, and they say, 'What difference does it make if I vote or not?' It makes all the difference.\" — Tim Walz, during a radio interview Her comments come after President Joe Biden seemingly referred to Trump supporters as \"garbage\" in an attempt to criticise racist remarks about Puerto Rico. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to the US territory as a \"floating island of garbage\" during Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally earlier this week. Speaking to Latino voters on a video call, Mr Biden told listeners \"the only garbage\" he saw was \"his supporters\". The White House has since attempted to downplay the remark, saying the president was referring to \"the hateful rhetoric\" as garbage and not the supporters present. The comment has been seized on by Donald Trump and Republicans to accuse the Harris campaign of looking down on the former president's supporters. Speaking to media on Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday local time, Ms Harris said she had not spoken to Mr Biden about the incident. \"Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear,\" she said. \"I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. \"You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not. \"I am sincere in what I mean. \"When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who didn't vote for me, and address their needs and their desires.\" An 18-year-old has been arrested in Florida after brandishing a machete at two Kamala Harris supporters outside an early-voting site. Caleb James Williams. (Reuters: Neptune Beach Police Department/Handout ) Caleb James Williams arrived at the Neptune Beach voting booth with a group carrying Trump flags, according to police. Neptune Beach Police Chief Michael J Key Jr said Mr Williams waved the machete at a 54-year-old woman and a 71-year-old woman. \"The group arrived to protest and antagonise the opposing political side,\" Chief Key said, adding they went to the booth \"for no other reason\". Mr Williams has been charged with aggravated assault on a person over 65 years old and improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon. The investigation is ongoing, but police have said the people with Mr Williams were all under 18 years old. Both the Republican Party's branch and the Democratic Party's branch in the area have urged for calm as voting continues. The Trump campaign has successfully sued election officials in a Pennsylvania county over mail-in voting. Bucks County officials gave voters until 5pm on Tuesday, local time, to apply in person for a mail-in ballot. However the Trump campaign claims voters were turned away before the deadline, meaning they were unable to cast their vote. A judge has granted the campaign's request to extend the deadline until Friday, local time. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party has also filed its own lawsuit against officials in the state's Erie County, claiming \"10,000 to 20,000 voters\" who applied have yet to receive their mail-in ballots. Pennsylvania is one of the most contested swing states in the US. The Erie County Board of Elections said in a statement it was \"acutely aware\" of issues delivering mail-in ballots. Donald Trump arrived in Wisconsin wearing a high-vis vest.  (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) As both campaigns grapple over the \"garbage\" controversy, Trump has taken it a step further – taking questions from media in a MAGA-branded garbage truck. The 78-year-old donned a high-vis vest as he stepped off his plane in Green Bay, Wisconsin. From the truck passenger's seat, he told reporters on the tarmac he believed he would be able to claim victory on election night. There were 161.42 million people registered to vote across the United States as of the mid-term elections in 2022, according to Statista. That was a decrease from the 2020 election, when 168.31 million people were registered. Other outlets, including the Bipartisan Policy Centre, have estimated about 244 million people will be eligible to vote. Americans are not required to vote, but must register to do so.

Donald Trump has jumped behind the wheel of a campaign-branded rubbish truck, criticising Joe Biden's comments about his \"garbage\" followers, despite the president saying he was talking about the demonisation of Latinos. The Trump campaign held rallies in North Carolina and Wisconsin, while the Harris campaign held campaign events in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Look back on what happened here.  By Georgie Hewson Thanks for joining us on today's live coverage of the US election campaign. We will be back tomorrow morning. In the mean time, stay across the latest on the ABC News website. Click below for a wrap on today's key moments from the campaign trail: By Georgie Hewson In case you missed it, here is a summary of events from the US election campaign today: By Georgie Hewson White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has confirmed Joe Biden will attend the inauguration of the next president in January regardless of whether Harris or Trump is elected. Jean-Pierre said the president believes in and is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and will be on hand for it. Then-president Donald Trump broke with historical precedent in January 2021 after he lost his bid for re-election to Biden and did not attend Biden's swearing-in at the Capitol. By Georgie Hewson The man suspected of setting fires in ballot drop boxes in Oregon and Washington state is an experienced metalworker and may be planning additional attacks, authorities said Wednesday. They believe the man who set the incendiary devices at ballot boxes in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Vancouver, Washington, had a \"wealth of experience\" in metal fabrication and welding, said Portland Police Bureau spokesperson Mike Benner. The way the devices were constructed and the way they were attached to the metal drop boxes showed that expertise, Benner said. Authorities described the suspect as a white man, age 30 to 40, who is balding or has very short hair. More on that here: By Georgie Hewson Prominent historical writers and filmmakers Ken Burns, Ron Chernow and Jon Meacham are among hundreds of historians who have signed an open letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Calling themselves \"Historians for Harris,\" the signees condemned Republican nominee Donald Trump as \"openly hostile to democracy and to American constitutional customs,\" and praised Harris for dedicating \"her life to affirming the rule of law and democracy.\" \"We believe, based on our study of the past, that the nation stands at an unprecedented historical as well as a political crossroads,\" the letter reads in part. \"We appeal to our fellow citizens, whether conservative, independent, or liberal, regardless of party affiliation, to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\" By Georgie Hewson As the 2024 campaign whirls into its final week, Democrats are noticeably leaning on their star power advantage, calling on a diverse range of celebrities to endorse Harris, invigorate audiences and, they hope, spur people to the ballot box. At today's rally in Wisconsin Gracie Abrams, Mumford & Sons, Remi Wolf and The National’s Matt Berninger and Aaron Dessner all performed. Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a former Republican governor of Harris' home state of California, announced on social media on that he is voting for Harris today as well. Now Jennifer Aniston has taken to social media to say she \"proudly voted for Kamala Harrisand Tim Walz\". The actress urged others to vote and that she voted for \"access to health care, for reproductive freedom, for equal rights, for safe schools, and a fair economy\". The Trump campaign has also leant on celebrity endoresments with Kid Rock, Waka Flocka Flam, Hulk Hogan and Dr Phil Mcgraw all making appearances at rallies recently.  By Georgie Hewson Elon Musk has been ordered to attend a court hearing in Philadelphia in a lawsuit seeking to stop a political action committee controlled by the billionaire from awarding $US 1 million to registered voters in battleground states ahead of the election. The lawsuit filed on Monday, called the giveaway by America PAC, which backs Donald Trump, an \"illegal lottery\" that enticed Pennsylvania residents to share personal data. \"It is further ordered that all parties must be present at the time of the hearing,\" a judge wrote on Wednesday in an order with the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. Musk promised to give $US1 million each day to someone who signed his online free-speech and gun-rights petition. The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk — the world's richest man — plays an outsized role in what is expected to be a razor-thin election. Reporting with Reuters By Georgie Hewson Vice President Kamala Harris is also heading to the battleground states of Nevada and Arizona tomorrow. She will then head back to Wisconsin on Friday, with rallies in the Green Bay area and Milwaukee to push early voting before the deadline on Saturday. By Georgie Hewson Tomorrow on the campaign trail, Donald Trump will attend several rallies. Several US publications say he'll be in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the US Southwest and in Henderson, Nevada, before heading to Phoenix, Arizona. Nevada and Arizona are two of the seven key swing states that will decide this election. By Elissa Steedman Global affairs editor John Lyons says while there's a number of distractions, the election will come down to a few key issues. By Georgie Hewson Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is using The Sphere in LasVegas to get her message out in the swing state of Nevada. Nevada is one of seven battleground states in the election and could play a pivotal role in the election outcome. The Sphere cost US$2.3 billion to build and officially opened in September 2023. By North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan I'm in Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg, where Kamala Harris held a rally earlier today. We heard mixed views here on Joe Biden's controversial comments, and whether it would affect his deputy's campaign. \"I don't know that it's helpful or unhelpful at this point,\" said Gettysburg resident Beth Kanagy. \"I mean, the rhetoric is not good, and it's not how we should be as a people. \"But the president can say what he wants, we all have the first amendment ... and he was pushing back on what he was hearing.\" \" Justin Warren describes himself as a life-long Republican who's instead voting for Harris at this election. He described Biden's comments as a \"terrible statement\". But he doesn't believe it will hurt his vice-president's chances.  \"She is not him,\" he said. \"He's the president, she's the vice-president. I don't think that's how she feels.\" By Georgie Hewson Meanwhile in Pennsylvania, a key swing state in the election, a judge has extended the deadline for voters to request a mail-in ballot. It comes after Donald Trump's campaign filed a lawsuit that alleged some supporters seeking ballots were improperly turned away. In the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, local time, the Trump campaign, along with Republican US senate candidate Dave McCormick and the Republican National Committee, said a county office sent voters home on Tuesday who formed long lines ahead of a 5pm deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot. Voters in Bucks County, which narrowly voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, will have until Friday to apply for, receive or return a mail-in ballot, according to an order from Judge Jeffrey Trauger. Pennsylvania is one of seven states known as battleground states, likely to decide Tuesday's presidential election. Its 19 electoral votes are seen as crucial for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris. Reporting with Reuters By Elissa Steedman Donald Trump earlier jumped into the driver's seat of a garbage truck on the tarmac of a Wisconsin airport to take a swing at President Joe Biden.  It's the latest in a back-and-forth between parties that was sparked on Sunday by a comedian at Trump's rally in New York. By Elissa Steedman One month after donning a MAGA hat on stage with Donald Trump, reggaeton artist Nicky Jam has withdrawn his endorsement of the former president. In a post to his Instagram account, the Travesuras singer said he was withdrawing his support because of comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at Trump's New York rally on Sunday. \"The reason I supported Donald Trump was because I thought he was the best for the economy in the United States, where a lot of Latinos live, a lot of immigrants who are suffering because of the economy,\" he told his 43.5 million followers. \"Never in my life did I think that one month later, there would be a comedian who would criticise my country and speak poorly of my country. And for that, I withdraw my support of Donald Trump. \"Puerto Rico should be respected.\" Nicky Jam, whose birth name is Nick Rivera Caminero, joined the former president onstage at a rally in Las Vegas in September. Kamala Harris' campaign later noted Trump incorrectly introduced the star as a woman when bringing him up on stage. By Audrey Courty As campaigning heats up in Wisconsin, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, are hosting trick-or-treaters on the White House lawn for the last time. The first lady showed up in a giant panda costume. She spent about an hour handing out treats to children with a suited-up Biden. By Elissa Steedman Just over 20 minutes later, and Kamala Harris has finished her speech in Madison. It's a substantially shorter speaking time than Donald Trump, who spoke for more than an hour in Green Bay. Harris again promised to be a president for all Americans and called on her supporters to focus on building community in the coming days to the election. By Elissa Steedman Kamala Harris tells her audience Donald Trump plans to introduce a national sales tax that will cost families thousands each year. She said as in his first administration, Trump will cut taxes for billionaires and big businesses.  \"This time, he will pay for it with a 20 per cent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported: clothes, food, toys, cellphones. \"A Trump sales tax would cost the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year. \"And on top of that, you would pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and gets rid of the Affordable Care Act.\" By Elissa Steedman Kamala Harris has paused her speech to address a protester chanting in the crowd at her rally. The vice-president had been telling the audience \"we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for\". \"We know we have an opportunity if — hey, you know what, listen: we all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out as soon as possible and I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known,\" she said.  \"And everyone has a right to be heard but right now, I am speaking.\" It's not the first time today Harris has shut down a protester at a rally. A similar exchange occurred during her Harrisburg, Pennsylvania speech, prompting cheers from the audience. By Elissa Steedman Kamala Harris has walked onstage at her rally in Madison, Wisconsin. She starts by telling the crowd when she was a child, her parents taught at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. \"So it's good to be back and it's good to be with so many incredible leaders,\" she says.

Remember to head to the ABC News website for all of the latest on US politics. To catch up on the week that was, click here: By Georgie Hewson Tomorrow, which is Friday US time, Donald Trump will hold a rally in Warren, Michigan before heading to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Michigan is a swing state and has the largest proportion of Arab Americans. Michigan helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, before Biden took the state back in 2020 Wisconsin is also one of the most contested states of the 2024 US election. Republicans held their national convention in Milwaukee, which saw Trump receive a hero's welcome from supporters after surviving being shot at just days before. By Georgie Hewson Celebrity endorsements are coming in thick and fast and stars continue to show up at democrat campaign events. Tomorrow, rapper Cardi B will speak at Vice President Kamala Harris's rally in Milwaukee on Friday. The Harris campaign announced the addition on Thursday. The event will also feature performances by GloRilla, Flo Milli, MC Lyte, The Isley Brothers and DJ GEMINI GILLY. This is not the first time Cardi B has jumped into the political fray. The rapper was close to Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign in 2020, including lauding his first run in 2016 and appearing in a video meant to appeal to young voters.  She has also been an outspoken critic of Trump and supported President Joe Biden in 2020. \"I'm tired of getting upset every single time I see this man talk,\" she said of Trump before Election Day in 2020. Reporting with AP By Georgie Hewson Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role in a Trump administration kept on rolling Thursday, with the former president adding \"women's health\" to his ideas for the former independent candidate for president who is now backing the Republican nominee. \"He's going to work on health and women's health and all of the different reasons,\" Trump told supporters during a campaign stop in Henderson, Nevada. This week, Trump has been talking about having a role for Kennedy, who has supported the disproven theory that vaccines are unsafe, in \"health\" and \"food,\" though he has joked, as he did Thursday, that he wants to keep Kennedy away from the nation's petroleum. Kennedy opposes the petroleum extraction process known as fracking, for instance. This week, a co-chair of Donald Trump's transition team said Kennedy wanted access to federal health data so he could show that vaccines were unsafe and lead to them being pulled from the market during a second Trump administration. Reporting with AP By Elissa Steedman Earlier this week, Donald Trump said he will accept the election result if he loses — if there is no evidence of voter fraud. But whether or not the former president agrees claims of fraud have been debunked is a different story. As Election Day approaches, Trump and his allies are increasingly sowing doubt about the legitimacy of votes, particularly in swing states. This week, Elon Musk directed followers to report allegations of election integrity issues to an \"Election Integrity Community\" on X. The feed, which is administered by Musk's America PAC, includes many claims of fraud that have already been debunked. One of those accusations claimed 53 voters were registered at the address of a Catholic church, but that not one actually lived there. But, as CNN reports, people were living there — 55 nuns of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie. By Kaitlin Easton A judge in Arizona ordered its secretary of state to release a list of registered voters who due to a glitch may not have provided proof of citizenship that is required by state law, a court filing showed on Thursday. A conservative organisation had sued Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, earlier this month after his office declined a public records request. A computer glitch had caused thousands in Arizona to be registered to vote without providing proof of citizenship. The secretary of state's office had said earlier those on the list may face threats or harassment if their names were released. The number of individuals affected by this issue is about 218,000, according to America First Legal, which filed the lawsuit. Reuters By Georgie Hewson The Kamala Harris rally with singer Jennifer Lopez is now over. Jennifer Lopez is one of the many Hispanic celebrities who signed on to help in the days after a comedian at Trump's rally in New York disparaged Puerto Rico as \"a floating island of garbage.\" You can watch her full speech here: By Georgie Hewson Kamala Harris, introduced by Jennifer Lopez has kicked off her speech to Las Vegas. She is hitting her usual points on women's access to abortion, bringing down cost of living, making homes more affordable, at home medicare, raising minimum wage and Trumps plans to get rid of the affordable care act. By Georgie Hewson Jennifer Lopez is no stranger to the stage in Las Vegas but she opens her speech by saying this one is the most important she has ever been on. \"The choices facing America now are monumental and you guys have made this place a city where dreams come true,\" she says.  \"You are the ones who are going to send the message that Nevada is Harris country.\" The singer spoke to the about comments on Puerto Ricans made by a comedian at a Trump rally. \"At Maddison Square Garden he reminded us who he was and what he really thinks of us,\" she says. \"It wasn't just Puerto Ricans who were offended, it was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character.\" By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke It's a brisk evening here in Las Vegas but Democratic supporters have filled the Craig Ranch Ampitheater. They've been entertained by Mexican ban Maná — who by some measures are the most successful Latin American band of all time with 25 million album sales under their respective belts and a bunch of Grammys. It's quite the atmosphere. We'll see how they react when global superstar, Jennifer Lopez takes the stage. J-Lo as she's also known has been a vocal supporter of VP Harris. She's also one of the most famous Puerto Ricans in the world and is likely to once again reference the derogatory joke made about the American territory at a Trump rally over the weekend (it was called a 'floating island of garbage'). The Latino vote is hugely important here in Nevada and the VP's pulling all stops to get their attention tonight. By North America correspondent Carrington Clarke We're here in glitzy Las Vegas, where instead of gambling or taking in a show, locals had a choice of rallies to occupy their afternoon/evening. Donald Trump held his in Henderson in the mid-afternoon. When the ABC visited about 4 hours before he was scheduled to take the stage, there was already a sizable line of supporters patiently waiting for entry. Sylvia Theis, 70, says she's with \"Donald Trump all the way\". She says she was \"better off four years ago\" and the biggest policy issues for her are \"drill baby drill\" (Donald Trump's promise to approve the extraction of more fossil fuels, despite the threat of climate change) and \"illegal aliens coming in\". Over and over again I heard that the economy and immigration were the major issues for Trump's supporters. Meanwhile, at the Harris rally, the recurring themes were abortion rights and the threat they say Donald Trump poses to democracy. One of those is Dianette Wells, 58, who says her most important issue is \"A woman's right to choose. I have two daughters and a granddaughter, and I'm here for them\" and worries that Trump could spell \"the end of Democracy in the US\". This isn't surprising, these are the issues both campaigns are hammering in their final pitches to voters. What is interesting is that even at the Harris event, the state of the economy looms large. The difference is, they think the Democrats have a better answer as to what to do with the economy. Latrisha Quarterman, 40, says she knows lots of people who've lost their jobs in recent years \"Nevada had one of the highest unemployment rates. We've seen casinos shutting down.\" She says Trump's focus on the economy resonates with lots of people but \"you have to look into what the actual plans are. And as far as Trump versus Kamala, it feels like Kamala has a little bit more of a plan of action versus Trump\" By Georgie Hewson The Harris campaign is gearing its message toward Latino voters tonight in Las Vegas. The band Maná is performing right now at the rally and Jennifer Lopez will deliver remarks soon. While US Latinos generally favour Democratic candidates, the Trump campaign has made inroads and is actively working to court the community. However, his campaign has also faced fallout from Puerto Ricans after a speaker at a New York rally disparaged the island. By Georgie Hewson Victor Willert, 68, was among the throngs of people who came to support the former president in Henderson, Nevada. One of the key issues driving his vote is the current cost of living. \"On the economic front, I was better off four years ago, OK, just plain and simple,\" he said. \"I'm a senior citizen, and fixed income. My buying power is reduced because of inflation.\" Recent figures have shown the rate of inflation has in fact cooled to 2.9 per cent. Despite that, many say they're still financially stretched. Kathy Schiefer is one of them. The mother of five, who's originally from Washington DC, said three of her children are business owners, which concerns her. \"I worry about that because if she [Kamala Harris] gets into office, they're just going to bankrupt this country. I firmly believe that.\" For others, America's standing on the global stage is front of mind. \"[The Democrats] don't represent the people that way, in the correct way. It makes us all look weak and other countries are laughing at us,\" David Santalucia said. The 37-year-old, who moved to Nevada from Buffalo, New York, came to the rally with his brother. Asked who he'll vote for, he tells me \"big time Trump – all the way\". \"Like there's no question. There are a thousand reasons. \"The weakness that the Biden administration has shown, it just makes the people look pathetic and it just makes our country look like jacks**t.\" Reporting by North America correspondent Carrington Clarke By Georgie Hewson We have just under an hour until we hear from Kamala Harris in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nevada Congresswoman Dina Titus is warming up the crowd, speaking about the importance of voter turnout in the key battleground state. Nevada is one of seven battleground states that could decide the US election. Historically, voting in Nevada goes down to the wire. But, in the last four elections, the Democrats have won the public's vote. The state also holds six critical Electoral College votes. \"I hate to tell you this, but Nevada is falling behind,\" Titus said. \"No, in fact, the Republicans are kicking our ass at the early voting. \"We cannot let that happen.\" This will be Kamala Harris's final pitch to Nevada voters before the election. By Georgie Hewson Make sure you stick with us as the day is not over for the vice-president. Soon Kamala Harris will attend a campaign event in Las Vegas with none other than Jennifer Lopez. By North America correspondent Barbara Miller Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has called on Elon Musk to take down a video circulating on social media purporting to show a Haitian immigrant voting multiple times for Kamala Harris using fake identities. Brad Raffensperger says the video is false and an example of \"targeted disinformation\". It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election. The Georgia Secretary of State says law enforcement is working to try and identify the source of the video. In the meantime, he asks Elon Musk, who has directed followers to report allegations of election integrity issues to an \"Election Integrity Community\" on X and other social media platforms, to take the video down. As Americans, we can't let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions — or each other. Brad Raffensperger is the official who Donald Trump famously tried to pressure to find him extra votes after the 2020 election. We caught up with him recently as he prepared for the 2024 election. By Georgie Hewson White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks, the Associated Press is reporting. Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe who referred to the US island territory of Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage.\" Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.\" The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading \"supporter's\" rather than \"supporters,\" which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president. The change was made after the press office \"conferred with the president,\" according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers' office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. The supervisor, in the email, called the press office's handling of the matter \"a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.\" Reporting with AP By Georgie Hewson Democrats are criticising Donald Trump over his controversial pledge to be the \"protector of women\" at his rally in Wisconsin. The former president told the crowd he was going against the advice of his aides. Gender issues are a major part of the election campaign after the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights in 2022. Three of the justices were appointed during the former president's first term. Kamala Harris says his comments show he doesn't understand women. More on that here: By North America correspondent Barbara Miller Voters in Bucks County, Pennsylvania have been making use of extended hours for early voting. The deadline was extended by three days after the Trump campaign brought legal action arguing some voters were turned away near the close of the initial early voting deadline. Pennsylvania has a somewhat complicated system for early voting. It's an on-demand mail ballot system, where you line up to apply for a mail-in ballot, which you can then cast in person. Hence the initial early cut-off, which was the same last day for actually mailing in a ballot. Confused? A lot of people are. Some in this line wondered whether it might just be quicker to come on polling day. The answer is probably yes. For some, though, it was about making a point after what they saw as voter suppression before the hours were extended. Pennsylvania could potentially be ground zero for legal challenges following the election, but then so could any of the swing states if there's a close result. The people we spoke to in line were mainly Trump supporters. This time, the GOP is actively encouraging people to get out and vote early. Nationwide, more than 55 million people have already cast a ballot. By Elissa Steedman The rules around processing and counting early votes differ from state to state. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a handful of states allow ballots cast early to be processed and counted before Election Day.

(ABC News: Tobias Hunt) Tens of millions of Americans will walk into a polling place on Tuesday to cast a vote for their preferred candidate for president — Harris or Trump. Then, they'll also be asked to vote for members of congress. Perhaps their governor. Or their local prosecutor, their water district, their sheriff, their fire district, their tax collectors and justices of the peace. Or their school board and local geological abatement officer. There are umpteen other positions on the ballot next week, with candidates running campaigns with policy platforms and raising money. Some estimates put the number of elected officials in the USA at more than 500,000. \"When I was voting in Chicago, for example, my ballot was 92 races long,\" says Alex Niemczewski, the founder of website BallotReady, which collates information about candidates and policies in \"down ballot\" elections. Alex Niemczewski's website BallotReady helps voters explore candidates and their policies. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt) \"Everyone I knew then admitted to guessing when they vote for local stuff,\" she says. \"I talked to reporters who admitted they didn't know what certain offices did. I talked to the mayor of Chicago who admitted to not understanding fully which judge he should vote for.\" If the mayor doesn't know the candidates, what hope does anyone else have? \"There's not enough local news coverage of local races,\" Niemczewski says. \"Sometimes there's no news coverage … and this means that voters, the first time they're hearing about the candidates is when they see their names on the ballot and they end up guessing or leaving it blank or not voting altogether.\" Bill Roth is running for a board position on the Santa Clara Valley Water District, in the city of San Jose, California. He says it's a big organisation, with a budget of around $1 billion a year, and 900 employees. \"This is definitely a bucket list item,\" Roth says. \"I've literally taken the year off, I'm basically paying for this out of my retirement, minus what we fundraise.\" \"This is always something I've wanted to do.\" Kamala Harris delivers her closing speech at the same place Donald Trump held a rally with supporters who went on to attack the US Capitol in 2021, pledging to put \"country above party\". Here are the latest updates. He'd want to be doing it for love, because it's not a lucrative job. \"You get $386 per day that you have meetings, so junior members of the board are making about $30,000,\" he says. \"That is probably about a 95 per cent pay cut to what I was making at the last Silicon Valley company.\" Roth has been hitting the pavement in his district, introducing himself to the neighbourhood, virtually every day for months. Because the brutal fact is that most of the 140,000 people in his electorate don't know the first thing about him. Many of them won't even know what the water district does. \"When you're this down ballot a race, it really is name recognition,\" Roth says. \"If [they] see a name they recognise, they may not know what the water district does, but they go, 'Oh I'll vote for that guy'.\" When I ask him if this process leads to the best qualified person getting the job, Roth pauses in thought. \"That's not the right question,\" he says. \"The right question is, does it get the person that most reflects what the people want? That's what it does.\" A few suburbs away, I catch up with Johnene Stebbins at a campaign event supporting her run for Superior Court Judge, the criminal court for Santa Clara County. \"I'm just trying to give people an opportunity to meet a candidate so that when they look at their ballot they can say, 'Oh, I've actually met her', instead of skipping it all together or just taking a wild guess.\" She adds: \"No one has heard my name before.\" It's becoming a familiar pattern. It's hard for candidates to cut through when they're on the same ballot paper as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Unlike the election for president, this race is non-partisan. There are no parties listed next to candidates' names, and Stebbins says this is an entirely new experience for her. \"This is the first time I've ever engaged in politics at all,\" she says. \"It's all new to me, getting endorsements.\" Johnene Stebbins is running for election for judge of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County in California. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt) The United States is one of very few countries that holds judicial elections. Except in countries like Bolivia, Switzerland and Japan, judges are typically appointed. And there's a tension between the information voters want to know to decide between candidates, and what the judicial code of ethics permits. \"I've gotten questions about immigration, I've gotten questions about Israel and Gaza — stuff that will never come across my desk,\" Stebbins says. \"It's hard to tell someone I'm not allowed to answer that because it sounds like you're trying to avoid something.\" That's one of the reasons that Judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell thinks judicial elections should be abolished. \"Judges are not politicians ,\" Cordell says. \"Judges cannot make promises to voters about what it is they will do when they're presiding over cases.\" \"The only promise a judge can ever make or a judicial candidate can ever make is to be independent, to be principled, and to uphold the law. That's it. Anything other than that really destroys the integrity of the judiciary.\" Cordell used to occupy the seat on the bench that Johnene Stebbins is running for. She is now deeply concerned about the role that money plays in judicial elections. Judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell thinks judicial elections should be abolished. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt) The dollar figures for down ballot races can be eye watering. Stebbins is raising a six-figure sum for her campaign. Races for statewide Supreme Court positions regularly cost millions of dollars. Last year in Wisconsin, $45 million was spent in the campaign for a single supreme court seat. \"The majority of the money coming into these judicial races comes from the legal community, from lawyers,\" Cordell says. \"In my view, it's just all wrong.\" Research also suggests that judicial elections can influence how judges do their jobs, especially in the lead-up to election day. Studies in Pennsylvania and Washington state, for instance, have found that judges become more punitive the closer they are to standing for re-election. But there are plenty of people in the US who defend the system as it stands. \"If it's a reasonable way to choose your president, I suppose it's a reasonable way to choose judges,\" Stebbins says. \"What I do think is it gives an opportunity for someone to run that might not fit into the political mould that you're looking for [in] appointment.\" Judges aren't the only participants in the justice system who are chosen by voters. Some of the lawyers they face in the courtroom also need to get endorsement from the public. If there's one local race drawing the most attention this election cycle, it might be the one for LA District Attorney, the chief prosecutor in Los Angeles County. Around 10 million people live in the county, and a fierce campaign is being fought over how best to tackle law and order in the city. The incumbent District Attorney George Gascón was elected four years ago on a platform of not seeking the death penalty and reducing excessive sentences. \"As a country we have over-incarcerated people for many, many, years and the application of our laws has been generally very racist,\" Gascón says. \"There's a lot of fear mongering, so while crime is down generally, fear is very high.\" LA District Attorney George Gascón. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt) He was challenged by 11 other candidates in the primary election, and his opponent for the general election is criminal lawyer Nathan Hochman. \"The current DA has enacted the most pro-criminal policies in all of DA history,\" Hochman says. \"It has created a sense of fear in society … [that] we have not experienced for years.\" This is a high profile and expensive race getting media coverage and televised debates. There are billboards and TV ads running. \"The limit that you can raise in my race is US$2.5 million,\" Hochman says. \"I've got to get TV, radio … then we have social media. We have text with video. We have email, and we have print mail. You use all the forms of communication .\" Still, the candidates admit that name recognition remains a problem. And so the campaign has reverted to party labels. Criminal lawyer Nathan Hochman. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt) Gascón has used the fact that he's a Democrat in his campaign material, while using the background of Hochman — who ran as the Republican candidate for state attorney-general two years ago — against him. For a non-partisan election, it's all very partisan. Despite the fact that he has been running as a Democrat, Gascón says the politicisation of the race is a consequence of America's polarisation. \"I think it's very detrimental and that's why I'm very hopeful that we will evolve from this place,\" he says. \"I do see light at the end of the tunnel.\" When I ask him if this would ideally be an elected position, he answers quickly: \"In an ideal world they shouldn't. Certainly judges should not be elected in an ideal world, but 'ideal world' is an abstract term.\" He adds: \"We have to work with the reality of our environment\" Americans do their elections big. Lots of races, lots of candidates, and lots of money. Alex Niemczewski says that \"theoretically\", it's a great way for citizens to hold local officials accountable. But practically? \"Sometimes practically,\" she says. \"Hopefully, increasingly more practically.\" Evidence shows that turnout is lower in down ballot races, especially when there's no presidential election drawing people to the polls. Even when people do vote, there's a high likelihood they're not as informed as they could be. And that's something Niemczewski is trying to help with. Her website BallotReady helps voters explore candidates and their policies by collating the information in one place. \"It is a tonne of work to gather all this information … a lot of it we have to call boards of elections, we have to submit requests via fax,\" she says. \"There's huge opportunity for the US to improve how we actually do democracy, how we make it work the way that it should.\" Just don't suggest the USA could stop holding as many elections as they do. \"Given, I think, that it's impossible that our country will change the way we do elections,\" Niemczewski says, \"I don't think it's worth fantasising about a more easy to access structure of democracy.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Analysis by Barbara Miller Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Carlos Barria) Elon Musk did not attend a court hearing over shutting down his controversial lottery. America PAC has given away $US1 million daily to a registered voter who has signed a petition. The matter is on hold in Philadelphia while the federal court is considering whether to take on the case. A legal challenge against Elon Musk's controversial million-dollar giveaway has been put on hold after a court hearing in which the billionaire failed to appear. Philadelphia's district attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, is trying to shut down the lottery being run by America PAC, a political action committee set up by Mr Musk to support Donald Trump's election campaign. America PAC has been giving away $US1 million ($1.5 million) per day to registered voters in key swing states who sign a petition in support of the first and second amendments of the US constitution. Some election experts have argued it violates federal prohibitions on people being paid to either register to vote or cast a ballot. But Mr Krasner is suing under Pennsylvania law, accusing America PAC of breaching the state's lottery and consumer protection rules. All parties, including Mr Musk, were ordered to appear at a court hearing in Philadelphia on Thursday morning local time. Elon Musk has promised to give away $US1 million a day leading up to the United States presidential election But as the hearing got underway, Mr Krasner's lawyer, John Summers, made a show of looking around the room for the Telsa CEO. Matthew Haverstick, who was representing both Mr Musk and America PAC, argued the political action committee should have been the only defendant to the case and that Mr Musk had been named as a publicity stunt. \"Pantomime aside, we all know he's a busy man who cannot just materialise on 12 hours' notice,\" he told the court. Mr Summers scoffed at that argument, pointing to Mr Musk's SpaceX company as an example of his resources. \"I think I just heard counsel for Mr Musk say that the richest man in the world, in the universe… that he can't just materialise on 12 hours' notice,\" Mr Summers said. \"C'mon,\" Judge Angelo Foglietta interrupted. \"He's not going to get in a rocket ship and take it to Philadelphia — let's be serious here.\" \"If anyone could land a rocket ship in Philadelphia, it's Elon Musk,\" Mr Summers quipped. Mr Musk's lawyers are trying to have the case moved to federal court. Judge Foglietta put the matter on hold while that court considers whether to take it up. Mr Musk has emerged as one of Donald Trump's most powerful and high-profile allies in this election campaign. He's attended rallies alongside the former president and conducted his own speaking tour, during which he used a novelty cheque to personally announce the winner of the first million-dollar prize. Mr Summers questioned how the lottery winners were being chosen, saying four of the 12 recipients so far had been residents of Pennsylvania. The state, which carries a hefty 19 electoral college votes, is considered a must-win for either Trump or vice-president Kamala Harris to claim the White House. \"Is it just a coincidence?\" Mr Summers asked the court. \"I don't think so.\" The giveaways have continued despite the legal challenge, and a woman from North Carolina was named as the latest winner on the morning of the court hearing. Mr Musk hasn't commented directly on the court case but has been posting on X throughout the day – including tweeting his congratulations to the previous day's winner. It's not yet clear if or when the case could come before the federal court, but time is running out for Philadelphia officials to try to halt the lottery. Mr Musk has said it would be running until election day, on Tuesday, local time.

(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque, Brendan McDermid) Donald Trump has said political opponent Liz Cheney would not be a \"radical war hawk\" if she had guns \"trained on her face\". He later said he did not believe Ms Cheney had the \"guts\" to fight in a war, and the Republican congresswoman slammed the comments. Trump and Kamala Harris continue a busy campaign ahead of Tuesday's vote. Donald Trump suggested that former GOP congresswoman Liz Cheney would not be a \"radical war hawk\" if she had guns \"trained on her face,\" as the Republican nominee's rhetoric draws increasing criticisms ahead of Tuesday's presidential election. Trump used a town hall event with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in Arizona on Thursday night to attack one of his most outspoken critics in his own party. He said Ms Cheney — the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney — was a war hawk and \"very dumb\". \"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?\" Trump said at the event in Glendale. \"Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.\" Trump had been railing about politicians escalating armed conflicts or starting new ones \"when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building\". On Friday morning, Ms Cheney took to social media to describe the former president as a \"vindictive, cruel and unstable man\". \"This is how dictators destroy free nations,\" she wrote on X. \"They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.\" Trump on Friday clarified the attack on his Truth social media platform, saying Cheney would not have \"the guts\" to fight in a war. \"It's easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she'll say, 'No thanks!',\" he wrote. Ms Cheney, who was a congresswoman for Wyoming between 2017 and 2023 and served as chair of the House Republican Conference, has been a prominent Trump critic, endorsing his rival Kamala Harris and even campaigning for the Democratic nominee. Ms Cheney has given stump speeches in support of Ms Harris — the current US vice-president — in several locations where there are concentrations of suburban GOP women on electoral rolls. Multiple polls have pointed to Ms Harris being more popular among women voters, and analysts argue Ms Cheney is trying to exploit the gender divide to make sure Trump does not return to the White House. Trump is often criticised for his statements about women — made over decades in both public and private settings — which have been described as everything from \"inappropriate\" to \"highly offensive\" and \"unhinged\". At a campaign event this week in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the 78-year-old said he was determined to protect women \"whether they like it or not\". He was last year found guilty in a civil case of sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s, in a lawsuit he claimed had been a \"scam\". Speaking before a flight to Wisconsin on Friday, Ms Harris said her rival's language meant he was \"unqualified to be president\". \"His enemies list has grown longer. His rhetoric has grown more extreme, and he is even less focused than before on the needs and the concerns and the challenges facing the American people.\" Speaking on CNN, Tom Corbett, a former Republican governor in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, also denounced Trump's comments about Ms Cheney, saying they had \"shocked\" him. \"When you see actions like that, you certainly have to question the ability of someone to function in the role of president,\" Mr Corbett said. Trump supporters Kathy, Kim, Sandra and Angelina are not concerned about the former US president's remarks. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) However, in another key battleground — Michigan — Trump's supporters backed the Republican nominee's comments as they queued to hear him speak at a campaign rally in Warren, just outside Detroit, on Friday. Kim, from Detroit's suburbs, said the media had taken the remarks out of context. \"They've changed all the things he said. They turned it around. He said, 'How would she like it if guns were pointed at her?'\" she said. \"He doesn't want to send people to war, is what he's saying. That's all it was but then the left-wing media is taking it out of context as they always do.\" Her friend Sandra, who's attended multiple Trump rallies, agreed, saying the media was \"up to its old tricks\". Clarissa, a Trump supporter, says she finds the Republican nominee's approach to politics refreshing. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) Kate, who had been waiting in line for the rally for over four hours, said Ms Cheney was out of touch. \"Liz Cheney is an incompetent former congresswoman and she has what I call Trump derangement syndrome. She'd be less inclined to be always for wars if she wasn't so insulated from it and so if she was in a war zone herself she wouldn't likely support them,\" she said. \"He has never said he wanted to eliminate his enemies. When we said, 'Lock Hillary up.' That was just a saying and she was not locked up. He wants to have a fair system for all Americans.\" Clarissa, who is from downtown Detroit and is a regular Trump rally attendee, said she liked the former president because \"he just says what he feels\". Michigan, which has 15 electoral college votes, is considered a critical battleground state. Joe Biden flipped it for the Democrats in 2020 when he won the presidency, after Trump turned it red in 2016. Kamala Harris attempts to distance herself from Joe Biden's comments about Donald Trump's supporters, which have attracted backlash in the final days of the campaign. The latest Trump-Cheney scrap came as the Democrats aired a new television ad, narrated by Julia Roberts, which depicts a woman \"secretly\" voting for Ms Harris against the advice of her husband. The ad points out the ballots are confidential and that \"no-one will ever know\" if you say one thing outside the polling booth but do another in it. Trump's ability to attract women voters has been called into question by others in his own party. Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who unsuccessfully ran against the former president for the GOP nomination, said his \"hyper-masculine rhetoric\" might encourage women to vote for Ms Harris. During a campaign event in Nevada on Thursday, Trump said he would have Robert F Kennedy Jr \"work on women's health\" if he won office. Mr Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic and former independent presidential candidate who also, briefly, tried to get on the Democrats' ticket, has claimed Trump has promised him control of the country's public health agencies if he wins Tuesday's election. EDITOR'S NOTE: This story was changed on 4/11/2024 to clarify that Donald Trump did not say guns \"should\" be trained on Liz Cheney. Instead, he said that if they were, she would change her position on foreign policy.

Cristina Junge won't hear a bad word about Donald Trump. \"He's not perfect,\" she said when the ABC met her in October at her retirement village outside Phoenix. \"But he is the man that we need at this moment.\" The 80-year-old moved to the US from Colombia in the 1960s — \"legally, of course\" — but she's angry about the number of people coming across the Mexican border without authorisation. Arizona's position bordering Mexico means immigration policy is in sharp focus here. Trump has been warning of a migrant \"invasion\" and promising the largest mass deportation program in the country's history. He's also promoted unfounded claims that Haitian migrants have eaten Ohio residents' pets and accused them of bringing crime waves to other small communities. Kamala Harris has condemned the \"dangerous\" rhetoric, but she's also toughened her stance on the border, with polls suggesting most voters believe Trump would do a better job of managing it. Democrats are banking that another issue — abortion —will help to motivate support on their side. Arizona is one of the states where citizens will vote on abortion rights on election day. And Harris — who has made the issue central to her campaign — hopes that will boost turnout for her in a state that could prove critical. Republicans have long dominated presidential elections in Arizona. In 2020, Joe Biden was just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years. Latino Americans could represent up to one in four Arizona voters this time around. It's a demographic that has historically leaned towards Democrats. But Cristina — who campaigns with the Latino Americans for Trump group — believes that's changing. \"I think that Latinos, we are very much of what Trump is. He believes in the family, number one,\" she says. \"So [I] believe in God, in the family, in freedom and in my country.\" Arizona's 2020 winner: Biden (0.39 per cent) Cristina's 2020 vote: Trump — \"What he promises, he accomplishes. In 2016, when he became president, this country really flourished in every way.\" Cristina's 2024 vote: Trump — \"He's going to give our country back to the people — not to the elites. He doesn't believe in globalism, and globalism is something that is destroying not only the United States, it's destroying the whole world.\" Georgia is the state where Donald Trump has been charged over alleged election interference, and Atlanta master barber Maurice Combs is just fine with that. \"He's on tape trying to fix an election,\" he said. \"I've got friends in jail for less, and I think he's been given too many passes.\" The 51-year-old thinks if Barack Obama was accused of the same crime, \"he'd probably still be in jail\". Maurice has been voting for Democratic candidates as long as he can remember, and when we first met him in early September, he said this year would be no different: he'd be backing Kamala Harris, even if it annoyed him that politicians only seemed to show up around election time. Georgia has tended to vote Republican in presidential elections, but Joe Biden flipped the \"peach state\" in 2020. Trump appeared unwilling to accept defeat, famously pressuring local Republican officials to \"find\" more votes. The actions of a Republican-dominated election board recently put election integrity back in the spotlight. The board pushed through new rules empowering local officials to carry out inquiries into vote counts and conduct hand counts. In October, a judge deemed those rules illegal, and Republicans appealed. One in three Georgians are African American, and if Trump can win over just a small number of them, he could win the state. He's been making overtures to Black men in particular, saying they relate to his mugshot, which was taken in the state last year. \"I don't know what Black men he's talking about,\" said Maurice. \"It's like a slap to the face, because he's privileged.\" When we checked in with Maurice again this week, he said it'd mean a lot to him if Harris won. \"It'd be a double whammy — a Black woman, a mixed Black woman, as the most powerful person in the world,\" he said. \"[That would mean] that opportunities are open, not just for me, but for everyone.\" Georgia's 2020 winner: Biden (0.24 per cent) Maurice's 2020 vote: Biden — \"Trump is an idiot, OK? … He says the stupidest, dumbest things and nobody looks twice. They're making this normal, but it's not. I got grandkids and I want them to grow up with values.\" Maurice's 2024 vote: Harris — \"She's not as bad as Donald Trump. We always have to vote for the lesser of two evils, whether we agree with her or not. Then you hope that everything goes alright, and they do their part.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mohammad Qazzaz took a campaign phone call from Joe Biden during his run for president. The 40-year-old cafe owner from Dearborn, south-west of Detroit, talked to him for more than 20 minutes. \"He assured me, when he found out I'm a Palestinian, that we're gonna fix the Palestinian issue.\" Then came October 7 and the war in Gaza and now Mohammad has lost all faith in Biden. \"It became worse under him,\" he said. He gave Biden's successor, Kamala Harris, \"a slim chance\" of doing something to end what he considers the genocide in Gaza, but \"she didn't do nothing\". He's among voters in America's first Arab-majority city who say they're considering voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. \"Or I might write in 'free Palestine'.\" Michigan is part of what's known as the \"blue wall\", a group of states that consistently voted for the Democratic candidate from 1992 until 2012. In 2016, Donald Trump won several blue wall states, including Michigan, where he defeated Hillary Clinton by just 11,000 votes. Biden won it back for the Democrats in 2020 by a margin of 154,000 votes. The Great Lakes state is now considered a key battleground. Mohammad was among more than 100,000 people who voted \"uncommitted\" in Michigan's primary election to choose a Democratic candidate for president. It was essentially a \"none of the above\" protest vote. At the time, he told the ABC: \"We saved America from Trump. Now we need to save Palestine from Joe Biden.\" If significant numbers of Arab-Americans and progressive Democrats lodge a protest vote by backing a third-party candidate it could boost Trump's chances. Mohammad says he takes that into account, even if he \"can't stand\" the former president. \"We don't care if Trump wins at this point. When it comes to Palestine, it's a red line.\" Michigan's 2020 winner: Biden (2.78 per cent) Mohammad's 2020 vote: Biden — \"Because I think Trump is a narcissist and a tyrant. He's a pathological liar. I almost died from COVID because of him, because I had COVID in 2020, the first strain … and I have health issues from it now.\" Mohammad's 2024 vote: Undecided — \"I hate Trump and I don't want him to win, but I can't see myself voting for Harris because she had many chances to give the Palestinian people a voice … that's the least thing I can do for my people back home that have been slaughtered and massacred.\" When we met Christine Cloud in the middle of the year, she was really feeling America's cost-of-living pressures. Aged 63, she'd been forced to move back in with her father because the rent on her Las Vegas apartment had been hiked up. \"Everything's up,\" she said at the time. \"Gas prices are crazy, food's gone way up.\" Nevada has diverse demographics, with large Latino, Asian and African American communities. A wide range of issues are at play, but a lot of voters say the economy is top of the list. The state's been hit by particularly high inflation and has one of the highest unemployment rates in the US. That's made it a target for Republicans, who are aiming to win Nevada's presidential contest for the first time in 20 years. Donald Trump used a visit to the state to announce he'd remove taxes on tips, which many service workers in Las Vegas and elsewhere rely on. Kamala Harris has since promised she'd do the same. Christine, one of many Californian transplants in Nevada, says she was once a \"dyed-in-the-wool Democrat\". She \"had enough of being a liberal\" in 2020, after protests and riots in American cities sparked by the police murder of George Floyd. She also said she liked the fact Trump was a businessman rather than a politician. \"He was not part of the government,\" she said. \"He was an outsider. I liked what he had done for the country. I liked his policies.\" When we first spoke to Christine in June, she had reservations about Trump, who she described as \"scary\", but she rated him as better than Joe Biden. Now, she's no more impressed with Harris, nor how she came to be the nominee. \"How easily they just pitched [Biden] to the side and put in someone who didn't have any votes … that didn't seem very democratic.\" Nevada's 2020 winner: Biden (2.39 per cent) Christine's 2020 vote: Trump — \"I felt like things were a lot better during those four years, it was very calm. There were no wars.\" Christine's 2024 vote: Trump — \"The vapidness of Kamala Harris… she doesn't have a brain to save her life. It's horrifying to even listen to her speak.\" Jaxon Fisher has always leaned towards the Republican side of politics for a simple reason. \"It favours my pockets,\" he told us when we met him a couple of weeks ago at the North Carolina State Fair. Now, as a young dad, that matters more than ever. \"I make decent money, but it feels like I'm broke all the time,\" the 28-year-old said. His vote for Donald Trump doesn't mean he thinks the former president is a perfect leader, though. \"I do agree he is rude at times,\" he said. \"He should watch the way he says some things. But at the end of the day, you gotta put your feelings to the side.\" North Carolina hasn't been held by a Democrat since Barack Obama became president in 2008. As the only key swing state that was won by Trump in 2020, it presents a pick-up opportunity for Kamala Harris. The state's rural areas are solidly Republican \"red\" and will likely come out in force for Trump. But there are strong pockets of Democrat \"blue\" in the larger cities, particularly around the booming \"Research Triangle\". The area contains three major universities, thousands of tech companies and the largest research park in the US. Jaxon grew up in the \"Triangle\", in North Carolina's capital, Raleigh. He said many young men like him supported Trump because they were worried about the future. \"I'm worried about her future,\" he added, referring to his baby daughter. \"Now, all I think about is when I'm not here one day,\" he said. \"If it's only getting worse, it's a snowball effect.\" North Carolina's 2020 winner: Trump (1.35 per cent) Jaxon's 2020 vote: Trump — \"People don't like Trump because of the way he says things. He's just really rude. But, I mean, if you put that to the side, he's definitely looking out for us.\" Jaxon's 2024 vote: Trump — \"I'm trying to raise my family and just try to do what's best for me and them. And it's hard when all the prices are just skyrocketing. You work so much and you still can't afford nothing.\" America's seemingly eternal debate over gun violence is particularly personal for Amanda Parezo. Three years ago, she'd just finished a game of kickball in a Philadelphia park when she suddenly heard gunshots. \"Within that single second of hearing the shot fired, I felt a sting in my right side of my body, and immediately I fell off of the bench that I was sitting on,\" remembers Amanda, an occupational therapist. \"I watched my friends fall to the ground trying to duck for cover, and other friends coming to administer first aid … in that instant, I knew I had a very severe spinal cord injury.\" Kamala Harris supports a ban on assault weapons, a move Joe Biden repeatedly called for but was unable to get through Congress. \"Hearing about school shooting after school shooting, I don't agree with any of the gun policies that we have in place right now,\" Amanda said. \"I feel that with Kamala, they will be much stricter.\" Amanda's home state of Pennsylvania is particularly important to the election result for one very big reason: with the fifth highest population in the country, it carries 19 electoral college votes — the most of any of the swing states. In 2016, Donald Trump ended decades of Democratic victories in Pennsylvania, partly by attracting support from white, working-class voters in rural areas. Joe Biden, who was born in Pennsylvania, flipped it four years later. Amanda acknowledges she lives in a \"blue Democrat bubble\" in Philadelphia, the state's largest city. But Trump has more support outside the big urban areas, and the result could be incredibly close. \"Every election, that's how it goes with Pennsylvania,\" said Amanda, a registered Democrat. \"I'm always on the edge of my seat.\" Amanda has experienced a range of emotions this election year. Early on, she was anxious about Biden's prospects, and had concerns about his age and capacity to do the job. After his debate against Trump in June, she was even more worried. \"I think scared is the best word to describe it, because it felt like he didn't really stand much of a chance,\" Amanda said. She remains nervous. \"Our country is so divided.\" Pennsylvania's 2020 winner: Biden (1.16 per cent) Amanda's 2020 vote: Biden — \"Everything that he stood for, I also stood for. And even more so I'm against anything that Donald Trump has to say.\" Amanda's 2024 vote: Harris — \"Because of her stance on gun laws and women's rights and disability rights, among other things.\" Keaira Bonner was chuffed when the Democrats made the switch from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris. \"It was the right move, the right time for America,\" the mental health worker told us back in August, soon after Harris became the nominee. \"I always vote, because I think that my voice matters,\" the 34-year-old said. She had been leaning towards voting for Biden, but she was \"not the happiest\" about it. \"I felt more conflicted, but I think with the switch to Harris, it was just like — now I know exactly what I'm doing, I'm excited about it, and I'm definitely going to show up at the polls.\" In every presidential election since 1992, Wisconsin voted for the Democratic candidate — until Donald Trump arrived on the scene. The Midwestern state fell to Trump in 2016, by a margin of 0.8 per cent. Biden wrested it back in 2020, and it became the \"tipping point\" state that gave him the White House. But the result was much closer than polls predicted, with just 20,000 votes in it. Demographically, Wisconsin is the whitest of the swing states. Some polls suggest non-white Wisconsinites, who have historically favoured Democratic candidates, are drifting towards Trump. When we met Keaira with her daughter at a community garden in Milwaukee, there was no risk of that. \"I have some strong feelings in relation to Trump,\" she said, pointing to his previous remarks about immigrants \"taking Black jobs\". \"I am a Black woman, and I think that it is important to be seen and for people to not necessarily make us feel invisible,\" Keaira said. \"But I think with Kamala, representation matters, and it's nice to be able to see myself within the candidates.\" Wisconsin's 2020 winner: Biden (0.64 per cent) Keaira's 2020 vote: Biden — \"I'm not the happiest with Biden.\" Keaira's 2020 vote: Harris — \"Before [Harris was running], people was almost feeling defeated, like, man, these are the two candidates that we have, it's between Biden and Trump? But now it's almost like this sense of like hope and joy.\" US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

He's already showing interest in 2024's backroom players. (AP: Patrick Semansky) It's two weeks after the 2020 US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers is meeting to certify their county's result. It's a huge county in the swing state of Michigan, covering most of the city of Detroit. The set-up for this meeting is as 2020 as it gets: It's a Zoom meeting, and the election officials are all sitting socially distanced from each other, each behind a plexiglas screen. \"If you get booted out, try and log back in,\" one official tells the virtual, gathered crowd. There are four board members; two Democrats and two Republicans. This even distribution is meant to be a safeguard, to make sure the boards stay neutral politically if there are mistakes or discrepancies to be resolved. The meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to certify the 2020 presidential election results was held on Zoom. (Supplied: Wayne County Board of Canvassers meeting) For the most part, these Board of Canvassers meetings are fairly routine. The election is run and done, and these people are here to check the result and certify it. But in Wayne County, things are about to get intense. The result in this county is going to become a flashpoint for a national movement denying Joe Biden's election win, and the meeting itself is going to attract the attention of his opponent, Donald Trump. In late 2020 president Donald Trump refused to concede the presidential election to Joe Biden, and pursued many avenues to deny the results. (AP: Susan Walsh) This meeting, and others like it after the 2020 election, will inform MAGA strategy for the next four years. The meeting was civil for the first couple of hours as the four canvassers asked questions about the results in various precincts. Poll challengers chant \"stop the count\" outside the door of a ballot counting room in Detroit, Michigan. (AP: Rebecca Cook) The Republicans had particular problems with precincts in areas with particularly high black populations. If there was a big mistake made while counting votes somewhere in the county, this was a chance to catch it. But in Wayne County Detroit, no big mistakes had occurred. And then when all the questions had been answered, it came to a vote: Should the results of the general election be certified? The two Democrats voted \"yes\". The two Republicans voted \"no\". A deadlocked vote. Their \"no\" vote was based on a discrepancy between the number of voters signing the voter roll and the number of votes counted. There were 878,000 ballots cast in the county across 1,100 precincts. To block certification, you'd want a pretty big discrepancy. But the discrepancy in this case was less than 500 votes total. That's not in one spot, it's across all 1,100 precincts. A discrepancy of this scale wasn't unusual, and it usually wouldn't warrant the blocking of certification. But the meeting was happening amid a larger, national conversation about the legitimacy of the election result, and it was getting more intense as the weeks went on. Disputes over the election results sparked protests and counter protests in late 2020, as misinformation about the election spread. (AP: Morry Gash) After the Republicans voted no, the meeting was opened up for public comment, and the public had a lot of comments. \"The idea that there would be a mismatch of one or two votes in many precincts is surprising to absolutely no-one,\" one observer told the virtually gathered crowd. Others got quite personal, hounding the Republicans to change their votes. \"Your nay votes leave a stain on your soul that is unconscionable.\" \"You're embarrassing our state!\" said another. \"You're embarrassing our county! Why don't you have any shame? Because you're not smart enough to realise you're in a cult!\" The criticism came from both Democrats and Republicans. One of Detroit's top local Republican officials, a city clerk, called in to take a few shots. And a Detroit police commissioner called in too. The public comment section of the meeting went on for three hours, into the evening. The Republican canvassers were worn down. After being subjected to all that, they agreed to change their votes, as long as an audit was conducted by the state government. The vote was passed, unanimously, certifying the results in Wayne County for Joe Biden. But before they could sign the paperwork, the two Republicans left the room. Monica Palmer was one of them. She explained in a press conference the following day what happened next. Monica Palmer was shaken as she left the Wayne County Board of Canvassers meeting. \"I was walked to my car … with [fellow Republican] member William Hartmann,\" she told the press the next day. The meeting had been intense, unexpectedly so. And as she reached her car things got a lot weirder. \"I received a phone call and it said will you accept a president … a call from the president?\" Monica Palmer said yes. \"I got in my car 'cause it was cold. Member Hartmann joined me. I received a call from the president.\" As a county-level election official, it was extremely unusual to get a call from the president himself. \"He thanked me for my service, asked me how I was doing. There was a genuine concern for my safety.\" She said there was nothing else discussed. \"That was the end of the call. Thank you for your service, glad you're safe, have a good night.\" Was that the end of the call though? What would happen if officials refused to certify an election result, for political reasons?  According to a recording of the call heard by The Detroit News, Trump told the board members that if they signed the paperwork, officially certifying the results, they would \"look terrible\". It reports he promised the board members he'd send lawyers to protect them if they just went home without signing the certificates. Monica Palmer and William Hartmann did as they were told. They went home, without signing the certificates. The following day, they said they would not sign them. It didn't matter. Officials said their verbal agreement, made before the phone call with Trump, was good enough. The partially signed certificates were sent up the chain and it was official: Joe Biden won Michigan. The attempt to overturn the result in Michigan failed. But the way this all shook out in Wayne County and in other key counties in swing states across the country has helped rouse support for a MAGA strategy in the four years since. Republican officials in Wayne County were unprepared for the wave of public criticism that faced them when they refused to certify the results there. But what if they were ready for it? What if they'd joined the board specifically to refuse to certify a result for Donald Trump's opponent? In the aftermath of the 2020 election, former top Trump adviser turned podcaster Steve Bannon brought a man named Schultz onto his podcast War Room. Dan Schultz had been talking about his \"precinct committee strategy\" for years, but the 2020 election led to its amplification on Steve Bannon's podcast War Room.  (Supplied: War Room) Over the course of 2021, Schultz became a regular on the show, and Bannon embraced what Schultz called the \"precinct committee strategy\". It's an incredibly boring and totally legal plan to encourage Trump supporters to take up vacant positions on Republican precinct committees. \"Don't just be a donor to the party,\" Schultz explained, \"become an owner of the party.\" He pointed to the hundreds of thousands of local precinct committee slots vacant in the Republican Party, available for someone to step up and fill. \"There's about 400,000 precinct committeeman slots in the Republican Party now,\" he told Bannon's audience. \"200,000, half, are vacant.\" Schultz had been pushing this \"strategy\" for more than a decade, talking about it in lectures and town hall meetings, but it only began to gain traction after the 2020 election. In the period between election day 2020 and the inauguration of Biden in January 2021, Trump's supporters were told by the president himself and others around him that the election had been stolen from them. In president Donald Trump's final months in the Oval Office, he was absorbed by attempts to remain in the White House. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) They were told that Trump was the rightful winner and should therefore remain president. Schultz's \"Precinct Committee Strategy\" was pushed by Bannon and others in the Trump-adjacent media as a way to stop an election from being stolen in the future. If you filled precinct-level positions with Trump supporters, the theory went, you could eventually find them overseeing local elections, and eventually sitting in positions like the ones Monica Palmer and William Hartmann held in Wayne County, Michigan. Where those two Republicans had caved to pressure and certified the election result, even just verbally, MAGA supporters who knew what they were signing up for would stand firm. They could use their positions to stop the certification of any election that had been 'stolen'. The \"precinct committee strategy\" has caught on. People who think the 2020 election was stolen from Trump have signed up for vacant precinct committee seats in their thousands. Dozens of them have managed to find their way onto the election certification boards. In swing states, the Centre for Media and Democracy estimates 98 election deniers now sit on canvassing boards, including taking up both Republican seats in Detroit's Wayne County. Rolling Stone Magazine reports that since the 2020 election, Republicans have refused to certify results in local and state-level elections at least 25 times. In the swing state of Georgia, Trump is very pleased with the line-up on the election board. He told a rally in Atlanta in August just how pleased. \"I don't know if you heard, but the Georgia State Election Board is in a very positive way.\" \"Janis Johnson, Rick Jeffries and Janelle King are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.\" Donald Trump has referenced the election board officials in Georgia by name, playing close attention to back-room players. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) These are election board officials, not political figures. What they might actually be able to achieve is unclear. If they refuse to certify the election results, it's likely their decision will be overturned in court. But they will certainly have the ability to slow down and confuse the vote-counting process. The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election is evidence that strategies that slow or confuse the election result can be used to disrupt the smooth transition of power.

(AP Photo: Paul Sancya) \"Well, we're not going to have this too much longer, you know? We're winding down, we're winding down.\" These were Donald Trump's opening remarks at a rally in the crucial swing state of Michigan on Friday. \"We're going to miss these rallies aren't we, huh? But they'll be even better rallies, in a different form, I think.\" I was one of the people he was talking to that afternoon. ABC's Insiders host David Speers and I queued with thousands of Trump supporters to get a seat inside the hall of Macomb Community College, in the suburbs of Detroit. At the start of the rally Donald Trump lamented the end of the campaign. (AP Photo: Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Thousands of Trump supporters attended the rally at Macomb Community College. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) This was the first section of Trump's speech. For a few minutes he lamented the end of the campaign, and the loss of this medium of connecting with his adoring fans. For many, this was their first time seeing their political hero, and he was beginning his speech by bidding farewell. He then spent some time talking about his ability to draw bigger crowds than any other political figure. \"We never have an empty seat and nobody leaves early,\" he told the crowd. In fact, 25 minutes into his speech, people did begin to leave early. Not many, but a steady stream. Probably at a rate of around 10 people per minute, folks in full MAGA regalia filed through the exit doors. By this stage I had been sitting next to David on an uncomfortable bleacher bench for two hours. During those two hours, a dozen or so other local Republican figures had spoken. Each came out with a carefully crafted message. \"The route to the White House goes through Macomb County!\" pronounced one local congresswoman, to cheers from the crowd. Other speakers begged the crowd to go out and vote early, and then call 10 people and get them to go out and vote early as well. All of their speeches were short and sharp, and all of them hit their applause lines hard. The crowd instinctively knew when to chant the campaign's catch phrases. \"Drill, baby, drill!\" \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" \"Too big to rig!\" A Hulk Hogan impersonator cheers during the Michigan rally. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) The crowd instinctively knew when to chant the campaign's catch phrases. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) A Black preacher from nearby Dearborn county had the crowd on their feet cheering so loud I genuinely couldn't hear what he was saying. The Republican politicians and guest speakers knew they had a job to do. Get the crowd excited, give the crowd incentive to go out and vote, and encourage others to do the same. Tell the crowd that they, Macomb County residents, have a chance to make a big difference in the election outcome. That last part is only half-true. Macomb County, in the northern suburbs of Detroit, is exactly where Donald Trump needs to gain votes to have any chance of winning Michigan. A Trump fan wears a trash bag as a shirt that says \"Trump trash\" across it. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Much of the crowd wasn't from Macomb County — or at least, the ones I spoke to weren't. They were from the outer fringe of Detroit, or from smaller cities in rural and regional Michigan. Some of them were from Ohio, where Trump hasn't campaigned at all this election cycle. Crossing state lines was their only chance to see him. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have been barnstorming the battleground states.   In other words, they were from areas where if you were to call 10 friends and encourage them to vote Republican, they'd likely tell you that they already were. Detroit, as a city, is predominantly Black. But the folks at the rally were overwhelmingly white — at least 90 per cent of them, by my estimate. When Trump emerged, there was raucous applause, cheering and whistling, but then as he drifted off prompter and told anecdotes about his time in the White House, or his experiences on the campaign trail, there were long periods where the crowd seemed to lose interest.

(Reuters: Brian Snyder) At one point, Trump feigned sympathy for Joe Biden, saying the sitting president was betrayed by his party when they told him to make way for Kamala Harris to run for the White House in July. \"Who cares?\" came a shout from the crowd. Trump laughed. \"I guess he happens to be right, who cares?\" he said, pointing at the heckler. \"Thank you for adding so much spice!\" Trump added. But by the time Trump finished speaking — 1 hour and 45 minutes after he started, large sections of the auditorium were empty.

(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has appeared on Saturday Night Live. She appeared in a sketch with actor Maya Rudolph, who has been playing her on the show.  It was Harris's first time on the show, which has had other presidential candidates over its decades-long run. US Vice-President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has appeared on Saturday Night Live. During a sketch at the start of the popular US comedy show, actor Maya Rudolph — who plays Harris on the show — said she wished to speak to someone else in her shoes. It is the final episode of SNL before the US election on Tuesday, November 5. \"Gosh, I wish I could talk to someone who has been in my shoes, you know, a Black, South-Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay area,\" Rudolph said. Kamala Harris and Maya Rudolph sit opposite one another on Saturday Night Live. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) And as she sat down at a mirror, Harris appeared on the other side to a roar of applause from the audience. \"You and me both sister,\" Harris replied. \"I am here to remind you — you got this. You can do something your opponent cannot do, you can open doors,\" she continued, in reference to Donald Trump struggling to open the door of a garbage truck this week. The Republican presidential nominee emerged from his plane in Wisconsin dressed in a fluoro orange vest before walking across the tarmac and onto a rubbish truck emblazoned with Trump campaign signage. It was in response to President Joe Biden seemingly referred to Trump supporters as \"garbage\" in an attempt to criticise racist remarks about Puerto Rico. Kamala Harris and Maya Rudolph open Saturday Night Live in New York. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) As Rudolph laughed at Harris's joke, the vice-president asked her: \"I don't really laugh like that do I?\" The pair continued to exchange words rhyming with Kamala, including \"drama-la\" and \"step-momala\", before both ending on \"keep calm-ala and carry on-ala\". Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have been barnstorming the battleground states.   \"We know each other so well we even finish each others belief in the promise of America,\" they continued in unison, while dressed in matching outfits. After a joke about Rudolph not being registered to vote in Pennsylvania — a key state in the election — they opened the show together. \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night,\" the pair shouted. Rudolph first played Harris on the show in 2019 and has reprised her role this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice-president, including calling herself \"Momala,\" a reference to the affectionate nickname that Harris's stepchildren call her. Rudolph opened the show's season premiere with the line: \"Well, well, well. Look who fell out of that coconut tree.\" And she's joked about keeping President Joe Biden in his place. Harris's husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, has been played by former cast member Andy Samberg and Biden is played by Dana Carvey, who also famously played then-president George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. It was Harris's first time on the show, which has had other presidential candidates over its decades-long run. Trump appeared during his first presidential bid in 2015, where he poked fun at his tendency to exaggerate and steer clear of policy specifics. He also appeared in 2004, long before he entered politics.

(ABC News: Emily Clark) Thousands of people have joined the Women's March in Washington DC as a feminist show of strength and to drive support towards the person vying to be the first woman elected president of the United States. In their chants and on their signs, those in the crowd on Saturday, local time, found some creative ways to make their feelings known. It came amid national debates about legal access to abortion and a woman's right to make choices about her own body ahead of the US presidential campaign.  With the vote just days away, those on the street had several very clear and very clever messages for Republican nominee Donald Trump, including:  \"We need a leader not a creepy tweeter.\" \"Uncle Sam stay outta my clam.\" \"Roe, Roe, Roe your vote.\" \"No sex with men until Roe comes back.\" \"Grab him by the ballot.\" \"Sometimes you gotta flush twice.\"  The march was not a campaign event, but the Women's March organisers billed the event as a \"powerful reminder to those in power that we are watching and demanding accountability – and that this November, women will win the White House\".  The event featured speeches from prominent activists emphasising a future free from domination and violence and who rallied the crowd before taking the streets. The march moved from Freedom Plaza, past the Washington Memorial and up to the White House.  The crowd was overwhelmingly in favour of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.  Women have been a key voting bloc for Ms Harris, who has been hoping to not just inspire Democrats to get out and vote, but to convince Republicans to switch sides.   She was recently endorsed by high-profile Republican Liz Cheney. Women marching on Washington became a regular occurrence after Trump's victory in 2016, and on Saturday the crowd chanted: \"We won't go back.\" They blame Trump for the restriction of their rights after he appointed conservative judges to the United States Supreme Court who then overturned Roe v Wade in 2022.  That decision removed the nationwide right to an abortion and triggered a series of bans and restrictions at the state level.  Currently, abortion is banned in almost all circumstances in 13 states.  Among the chanting crowd is grandmother Penny Herlihy, who turned out to march alongside a throng of young faces. She peeled away to speak to the ABC, handing her hand-painted sign that reads \"EVEN WINE CAN'T FIX THIS\" to her granddaughter.  \"I'm here for my daughter, my daughters-in-law, my five absolutely beautiful granddaughters and for all women everywhere,\" she said. When it comes to the race for the White House, Ms Herlihy said the choice between the two options could not be more stark. She cast her vote for Ms Harris as soon as she could. \"The opposition is a misogynist. He's an anarch. He is unfit to be a human being, let alone a president,\" Mr Herlihy said. \"She will lead our country forward. Unity!\" she said before her grandchildren erupted in applause. Lori Harris travelled to the nation's capital from New Jersey to attend the women's march for her 20th year in a row. \"I have nieces, I have granddaughters and, even though this probably doesn't affect me, women are already dying and I just think it's a matter of life and death,\" she said.  \"Abortions aren't going to stop. They're just going to be less safe. \"This is just about controlling women.\" But she is not just here for women's reproductive rights. Ms Harris came to show her support for a woman of colour being installed in the White House. \"Trump is really dangerous. He's a dangerous man,\" she said.  \"I'm a psychotherapist and a grad school student could diagnose him. \"And he's really degraded — his cognitive decline is really conspicuous. \"This is a really dangerous time. I'm afraid — I really am.\" Eileen Boyle, her twin sister Carole and two friends Mary Cahill and Kim Kroeger travelled from Massachusetts to be in Washington DC for the march.  \"We felt like we needed to do one last rallying cry before the election on Tuesday,\" Ms Boyle said.  \"My mother, at a very young age, she was progressive and she instilled in us women's rights and human rights, and we're trying to carry the torch.\"  When talking about the younger women in their life, Kim said: \"We're doing this for them.\" The group found their original pink \"pussyhats\" and took a road trip to the Capitol.  Women's March began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017, and highlighted his rhetoric and policy positions. They have been an annual fixture since. At the time, some estimates put the size of the demonstration in Washington at almost 500,000 people. Millions participated around the country. This year's event saw people travel from as far away as Washington state, signalling a revival of the movement now Trump is potentially just days away from winning another term.  Organisers originally planned the events to send a message to the new president, whose candidacy was punctuated by criticisms about his attitude towards women. At the forefront of those was the publication of a video from 2005 – known as the Access Hollywood tape – which involved Trump making multiple crude comments about women. In the recording, Trump could be heard saying \"you can do anything\" to women if you are \"a star\" including \"grab 'em by the pussy\". Subsequently, distinctive pink \"pussyhats\" — which were the result of a countrywide craft campaign and donned by many march attendees — became synonymous with the movement.

Harris kicked off the week in Pennsylvania, while Trump started it in New York — the place that made him a billionaire and a felon but has never voted to make him president. Both candidates have been crisscrossing the nation — Harris in Air Force Two, Trump in Trump Force One. From Monday, Harris and Trump ratcheted things up, making multiple stops each day. Harris has been making closing argument speeches — first in Washington DC at the location where Trump called on his supporters to \"stop the steal\" before they stormed towards the Capitol after the 2020 election. From there, Harris took her campaign through Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The Democrats are hyper focused on the battleground states and aren't making the mistakes of campaigns past, ensuring Wisconsin is part of the final push. Both candidates darted west for Sun Belt stops in Arizona and Nevada, before setting course for the closest races and the finish line. This is the American election industry in full flight.   Pundits believe there are seven states up for grabs — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mapping the most-visited locations of the candidates, it is obvious internal polling is telling their teams the same thing. Every state and every stop in this final push is a strategic one, designed to shore up the base, get people out to vote and convince the so-called \"undecideds\". This race is predicted to be close — perhaps the closest ever — but it is also extremely well-funded and with just days to go, the nominees are raiding their war chests. They're spending big on blanket advertising, a sprawling ground game and gruelling travel schedule. Campaign finance experts say it takes $US1 billion to win the American presidency. This is how it's done. Multiple assassination attempts, a post-primary change of candidate, celebrity endorsements, a problematic comedian, the richest man in the world and a garbage truck — this presidential campaign has taken some turns. On the ground in the United States, November 5 can't come soon enough. But in this final sprint, there are some notable differences in how the Democratic and Republican campaigns are storming to the finish line and how much they've got to spend while they do it. Where they compare right now is in the polls, especially in the highly coveted state of Pennsylvania. Current polling has Harris and Trump deadlocked in the state. They're also close to being tied in terms of the amount of attention being paid to Pennsylvania as they hunt down the 19 electoral college votes on offer there.  Since September 1, Trump has visited Pennsylvania 19 times; Harris 20, with more stops to come before Tuesday. Pennsylvania is part of what was once the so-called \"blue wall\". Together with Michigan and Wisconsin, it represented an unofficial voting bloc that was reliably Democrat, but in 2016, Trump changed that. Now bleeding across the so-called blue wall are bright red spots, or perhaps swathes. In 2020, Joe Biden won all three of these Mid-West states. When Pennsylvania was called for Biden, the election was too. But the closest result across the blue wall was in Wisconsin. In that state, organisers have long known they would have to run very different campaigns in 2024. And over the past week, the full force of the two major travelling roadshows arrived. When Biden stepped down and endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee, her first rally was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She had planned to be there just days after the Republican convention was packed down and to take the stage as the vice-presidential candidate. But by the time the house lights were on her, Harris was auditioning for the lead role. Since then, Harris has been to Wisconsin nine times. Trump has been back to the state known as America's \"dairyland\" seven times since his party's convention on July 23. They may have paid Pennsylvania and Michigan more attention overall, but over the past week it was Wisconsin's turn. On Wednesday night local time, while Trump was climbing into a rubbish truck in Green Bay in north Wisconsin, Harris was on the campus of the University of Wisconsin Madison in deep blue territory talking to students about the future. And again on Friday night, the two candidates went head to head — both rallying in Milwaukee, the state's biggest city. Veteran Republican pollster and president of North Star Opinion Whit Ayres told the ABC: \"It is incredibly close in Wisconsin according to all public polling.\" Polling averages published by Five Thirty Eight had Harris at 48.2 per cent and Trump at 47.4 per cent as of Saturday. \"Polling is not precise enough to be able to make a distinction between a 48 and 47,\" Mr Ayers said. \"The best we can say, based upon polling in Wisconsin, is that the race is a dead heat.\" Polls help campaigns determine where they're vulnerable and where to deploy resources and what the next major moment on the calendar will be.  When Harris's team decides another event is needed in Wisconsin, Hannah Gaffney's day changes. She's the regional Get Out the Vote director for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. \"Things just happen really quick. We will find out, sometimes less than 24 hours before someone will come into town, and all of our plans will change, and we have to accommodate for Secret Service or way more people than we anticipated,\" she said. \"It's so fast, and it's really impressive. I think the difficult thing about it is, in terms of getting out the vote, we not only want to motivate the base, but also bring new people into the electorate.\" For that reason, the campaigns have multiple speeds. One of them is the ground game.   It's easy to say every vote counts, but what that means for campaign teams on the ground is figuring out where there is a possible gain to be made. In Wisconsin, local television channels are full of political ads that run back-to-back, separated only by the occasional commercial for a local garage door business. The campaigns are searching for people who don't usually cast a ballot in elections, and trying to change their minds. This group is referred to as \"low-propensity voters\", but there's a risk they simply turn the television off amid the advertising onslaught. Wisconsin member of the Republican National Committee Terry Dittrich said the ground game was about \"chasing\" would-be voters, starting with knocking on their door. \"We stay with them. We chase them all the way to the point where we can confirm whether they've voted by absentee or whether they're going to vote in person and make sure that they actually get there and vote,\" he said.  \"So it takes a lot of manpower, takes a lot of data, takes a lot of follow-up.\"  Listening to canvassers do this, they're very particular in their language. Do you have a plan to vote? What identification will you take with you? How will you get to the polling station? You could vote early – something both campaigns have been encouraging Americans to do. Mr Dittrich said in his home county of Waukesha, his team had been out chasing voters for 24 weeks. But at a national level, the Republican Party has also been outsourcing the ground game.   \"The Democrats have put enormous amounts of money and time and effort into the ground game,\" Mr Ayers said. \"The Trump campaign, on the other hand, has basically subcontracted much of their ground game to third-party vendors, and we'll see if that's very effective.\"  Long-time Republican voter Michael, who asked for his last name not to be used, was there to see Trump speak in Wisconsin on Wednesday. It was his first Trump rally. Michael said this was also the first election that had motivated him to join the local effort to go and find people who may not vote and usher them to the polls. \"I've been boots on the ground,\" he said. \"I've been doing a lot of the … data entry work, as we go around and we canvass, we're knocking on doors of Republicans and we're looking at the voter rolls and making sure they're accurate.\" He said in his community of Two Rivers along Lake Michigan, the Republicans have had \"a much, much better ground game than they've had in the past\". \"There is a real sense of urgency. There's no way you can escape it. \"Between television, social media, and people knocking on your door, you really get that sense that people realise how important it is.\" But Michael said he was not doing this work in association with the official Trump campaign, but via something called a super political action committee (PAC). The term refers to numerous tax-exempt groups that campaign and influence politics on behalf of members or vested interests. But they sit outside the campaigns themselves.  \"It's an unusual strategy. In the past, Republican National Committee has run the ground game, and they have for some reason, decided to subcontract kind of third-party groups,\" Mr Ayers said.  Among those outside groups is America PAC and its backer Elon Musk, the self-styled champion of \"Dark MAGA\". Recently, alarm bells started ringing over the outsourcing strategy and whether it had a hope of working, with some reporting describing Trump's ground game in Michigan as being \"left to Elon Musk's America PAC, podcasts, and vibes\". On the quaint University of Wisconsin Madison campus, the ground game feels different to that. Most days of the week throughout the campaign, the UW Madison chapter of College Democrats has been staffing a table covered in Harris Walz stickers. The students diligently swap in and out between classes as they volunteer to direct their peers towards the on-campus polling station. Chair of College Democrats at UW Madison Joey Wendtland said: \"Students are more likely to listen to fellow students.\"  \"One of my favourite things is seeing people come back with that 'I Voted' sticker after we talked to them,\" he said.  These Americans are also part of a ground game, but one that's part of the Democratic Party itself. On Friday afternoon, as the surrounding fraternity and sorority houses were gearing up for Halloween parties, Get Out the Vote and College Democrats held a \"block party\" to reach more potential voters. Mr Wendtland said it was about removing the barrier between students and the politics that impact their lives.  \"We had [congressional] representative Mark Pocan ... he was actually out tabling with us yesterday, and it's really cool, because he's on the ballot, so it's cool to give people that opportunity to speak with him,\" he said.   \"There were just random people walking by, and we'd ask, 'Oh, do you want to speak with your congressman? He's right here.' And people go 'Oh, really.' And they want to have that conversation.\"  The College Democrats and UW Madison might be just one small trestle table, but they are part of a behemoth of a campaign machine.  Right now, Kamala Harris \"is everywhere\".  \"She is on television, has a larger ground game, has larger social media influence, so the Harris campaign is more prominent across a various range of communication strategies, but it's still tied,\" Mr Ayers said.   \"The problem is you don't know what is going to move those final few people in the remaining days before the election, and so you try to do everything you can possibly think of.\" And you try the things you can afford.  For Harris’s campaign, the possibilities are endless.  The Democratic nominee made a stop in Las Vegas, Nevada on Thursday and while she was there, her campaign projected her face onto the Sphere, a recently opened indoor stadium, with an exterior made entirely of LED screens. If you have to bet big to win big in Sin City, with just days to go, maybe Harris’s face being beamed from the 112-metre-high orb could sway some voters. In January, PR Week reported a spot on the Sphere would set the advertiser back roughly $US450,000 ($686,000). At the final filing deadline before the November 5 vote, both the campaigns had to declare how much cash they had to work with.  At that time, on October 16, the Harris campaign had a nest egg of $US119 million. But as Brendan Galvin from election funding research group Open Secrets said, \"Trump did not have much money in the bank\". \"The Trump campaign had $US36 million cash in the bank, which is pretty light for a presidential campaign at this point,\" he said. The Harris campaign committee has now cracked the $US1 billion mark in terms of total funds raised, while Trump's official funding sits at $US381 million. Trump has benefited from those third-party groups and outside spending to the tune of more than $US694 million, but in recent weeks Harris has reduced the gap. When asked how much it costs to fund a successful presidential campaign, with the private jets, the massive staff, the ground game and the unbreakable stream of network advertisements, Mr Galvin said: \"You're really going to need a billion dollars to get you over the line.\"  Of course on election day though, Americans are voting on more than who to send to the Oval Office.  Open Secrets is forecasting this election, including congressional districts and other down ballot races, will be the most expensive ever, with the total amount spent reaching $US15.9 billion, exceeding the 2020 spend of $US15.1 billion. \"Our elections have become their own little economy,\" he said. \"We don't see any indicators that this is going to slow down.\" Reporting: Emily Clark in Wisconsin and Mark Doman  Photography: Emily Clark, Bradley McLennan and Reuters  Design: Brody Smith Development: Thomas Brettell Digital production: Mark Doman and Emily Clark Elections Political Campaigns Political Donations US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Despite the US economy being strong and unemployment low, the cost of living is high. As a result many families don't feel like like they're doing well and that is something Donald Trump has tapped into by asking one simple question: 'Are you doing better than you were four years ago'? The Maciejewski family are feeling the pinch. Their weekly trip to Costco keeps getting more expensive. \"I'm easily spending $US350 to $US400 ($530 to $605) in a shopping trip,\" Rachel Maciejewski says, as she unloads her shopping on the kitchen bench at her home on the outskirts of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Rachel and her husband earn above the median wage and they're cutting back due to the cost of living.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) It wasn't like this four years ago. \"I would say I felt like I could, if I budgeted appropriately, get away with between US$150 and $200 ($227 to $302).\" Rachel's a nurse. Her husband Scott is a police officer. They earn a combined US$150,000 ($227,000) and have a small mortgage, but their salaries have not kept up with the cost of living. To save money they've pulled their youngest daughter, Brinley, 6, out of her gymnastics classes. And they've shelved plans to remodel their basement to give their four girls a bit more breathing space. All of Rachel's daughters share bedrooms.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"We are bursting at the seams,\" Rachel told 7.30. \"They don't have a lot of space to hang out or have friends over. They all share bedrooms, so there isn't private space for them to hang out. So yes, I would love (to move to a bigger house), but it's just nothing that we have been able to afford, and now, with interest rates and the cost of homes going up, it's just not even an option for us. \"We were living much richer lives when he [Trump] was in office.\" House prices have risen dramatically in Milwaukee since Trump was president. In Milwaukee property prices for houses have risen significantly. (ABC News) In nearby Menomonee Falls, local real estate agent Chris Slinker says what was a US$600,000 ($908,488) home now sells for about US$800,000–850,000 ($1.2m-$1.3m). That's an expensive home in Milwaukee, where the average house price is around $US250,000 ($379,000). \"The policies of the current administration have put a huge strain on the economy, not just in the housing market, but multiple markets,\" Mr Slinker told 7.30. \"I think housing is just one big example, because in many cases, at least in the United States, our home is one of our biggest investments.\" Mr Slinker has skin in the game though. He is the vice-chair of the local branch of the Republican Party, and blames the Democrats for America's high inflation rate, which peaked in 2022 at 9.1 per cent. Chris Slinker is a real estate agent and vice-chair of the local branch of the Republican Party.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"I think that Donald Trump and the Trump administration had a much better handle on appropriately spending money in the economy than the left does,\" he said. \"I think the left likes to spend money and become reactionary about it and say, 'OK, now we have to pay for it'.\" This part of Menomonee Falls is Republican but there are some Democratic outposts, like the home of Gary Nuetzel, where his front lawn and windows declare his support for Kamala Harris. Wisconsin is one of the swing states in the upcoming US election. (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"I mean, prices may be up, but that happens, up and down. It fluctuates. Things like that will fluctuate over time.\" \"The number one issue is Donald Trump and his incompetence, and for the presidency, his disgraceful performance in the past, trying to overthrow the election and January 6, that is really, to me, the overriding number one issue.\" Donald Trump supporters clashing with police officers in front of the US Capitol Building on January 6, 2021. (Reuters: Leah Millis) In Wisconsin's Racine County — which has swung for both sides in recent presidential elections — cost of living isn't the deciding factor for Paul Hummer either. \"A big one for me is on the women's stuff, the freedoms that seem to be taken away out of their hands and put into put into the government's hands,\" Mr Hummer told 7.30. \"I don't necessarily like that stuff, not that I'm like pro abortion, but I believe it's up to the woman in the situation she's in.\" Paul Hummer hopes the American discord can end after the election.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) Mr Hummer spent his Friday night at Castle Lanes Bowling Alley, where he was nailing strike after strike. \"I think it's because an Aussie TV crew is watching,\" he quipped. \"Where are you next Friday?\" While he is loose at the lanes, he says he's looking forward to election day, just so some of the tension can go out of the air. He also hopes some of the vitriol that is so present in modern day US politics can be dialled back. Friday night bowling is a ritual for Paul Hummer and his friends.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"It's gonna sound like a cliche answer, but I want people to be able to get along like 30, 40, years ago,\" he said. \"When I was you know, 20 years old, people had differences in politics and we disagreed, but we still were all friends and got along and we didn't believe one side was trying to destroy the other.  \"I would like the country to get back to that, whether it happens, I don't know. I don't like the hate in politics.\" Ms Maciejewski feels so strongly about Donald Trump that she was among the 10,000-strong crowd that attended his rally on Friday night. \"Oh my gosh. It was fun. It was fun. It was great to be amongst like-minded people,\" she said. She said secure borders and the safety of her daughters were most important to her. Rachel with her husband Scott and their four daughters.  (ABC News: Craig Hansen) \"I feel like Donald Trump, we had a secure border under him,\" she said. \"I felt my girls were safer. You know, all the men in women's sports and locker rooms and bathrooms and all of that is just out of hand, and I want to protect my daughters.\" Donald Trump's frustrations with a faulty microphone boiled over at the Milwaukee rally. He spoke of \"knocking the hell out of people backstage\" and at one point appeared to mimic fellating the microphone. Donald Trump made what some suggested was a lewd gesture with his microphone in MIlwaukee. (Reuters: Joel Angel Juarez) Rachel has a strong Christian faith and attends church or church events up to three times a week. So how does some of Trump's behaviour and language sit with her Christian values? \"You know, nobody is perfect,\" she said. \"God is the only perfect being. We all make mistakes. I think the mean tweets, I think they're unintentional at times, jovial at times … like we could compare continuously in Kamala versus Donald Trump. I mean, we teach our kids to not to lie, and unfortunately, I think Kamala is continuously lying.\" As to the issue of truth and Trump's past false claims of election fraud, Ms Maciejewski said she sometimes questioned the result of elections and hoped the 2024 election result would be accurate. \"I wonder about the legitimacy sometimes, so I hope that the winner will win.\" The US goes to the polls on November 5.

(Reuters: Leah Millis) An opinion poll from Iowa has predicted Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will claim a surprise victory in the state in Tuesday's presidential election. The Des Moines Register/Selzer poll is rated among the most accurate in the United States, and has a history of correct political predictions.  Analysts argue that, although the poll is within the margin of error, the result from Iowa — a state that Donald Trump had been expected to win easily — bodes well for Harris elsewhere. If you look at only one opinion poll ahead of the US presidential election, many argue it should be Ann Selzer's. The Iowa-based analyst predicted Donald Trump's victory in 2016 when almost every other crystal ball got smashed. Her reputation for accuracy has been cemented with swathes of correct forecasts in various US political contests before and after that, to the point she's even been referred to as an \"oracle\". Most observers believe Tuesday's election could be among the closest in history, but Selzer's poll made a clear call when it was published at the weekend, and it's good news for Kamala Harris. More on that later. Another sample released early on Sunday, local time, had encouraging signs for the Democratic candidate, indicating she could have narrow leads over Trump in multiple battleground states. The New York Times/Siena College poll claimed Harris was ahead among likely voters in the swing states of Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia. It predicted Harris and Trump were deadlocked in Michigan and Pennsylvania, which — with its 19 electoral college votes — is among the juiciest prizes on Tuesday. All results were within the margin of error, except one, which had Trump flipping the state of Arizona comfortably 49 per cent versus 45. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump found time to dance on stage at his rally in Lititz.  (Reuters: Brian Snyder) Harris and her Republican opponent have spent the final week of the campaign crisscrossing the country, targeting seven states in particular which are considered toss-ups. That's what makes Selzer's sample from Iowa so interesting — it's not one of them. Trump won the state by more than 8 percentage points in 2020 and it's not rated as \"in play\" this time around. Indeed, Harris hasn't even been campaigning there in person. But the Selzer sample, published in the Des Moines Register late on Saturday, claimed Harris would carry the state 47 per cent to 44 among likely voters. While the result was within the margin of error, analysts pointed out that even a narrow defeat for the Democratic candidate in a state Trump was predicted to win easily boded well for her in closer races. Speaking at a rally in Litiz, Pennsylvania, on Sunday, Trump described the Selzer poll as \"fake\". He also railed against the result on social media, pointing out several other surveys had him leading Iowa by significant margins. Emerson and Rasmussen polls had the former president winning the state by about 10 points. Michael Miller, a 62-year-old Trump supporter, told the ABC outside the rally that he was not confident which way the election would go. \"We're all here [and] it looks, 'Wow, everybody's here for President Trump!' but, you know, you go to another rally where Kamala and Tim Walz are, you're going to have the same vibe there,\" he said. \"They're going to think that they're out front, you know, so it's going to be interesting to see what happens on Tuesday. \"I don't even know if we'll have a winner on Tuesday night.\" Carrington Frick, a 23-year-old Trump supporter, agreed. \"It's hard. The polls have been going back and forth. It's pretty much a toss-up,\" he said. \"So we just — you have to try to spread the word as much as possible and get as many people that you know, out to vote.\" Joicen Spratling and Melanie Macias, both 19, are first-time voters who are supporting Kamala Harris. (ABC News: Jade Macmillan) Meanwhile, outside a Harris rally in East Lansing, Michigan, attendees canvassed by the ABC were predicting a close race. Paula Pulter argued women were going to be critical to the result. Polls have consistently showed Harris ahead among women voters, but Trump leading among men. \"I really think that women are going to be the voting bloc that carries her over the top,\" Ms Pulter said. \"I think that we are finally standing up with our voice and giving her the support that she needs to win this election.\" Joicen Spratling, 19, was also at the rally. Mr Spratling said he believed polls that outlined Michigan would be a nail-biting race. \"It's too close for comfort. I don't know how this many people can support him (Trump) after things he's done and said and after the four years of him being in office and corrupting it,\" he said. \"So it's scary that it's that close, but I think it is accurate.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Carrington Clarke Analysis by John Lyons US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Harris, spending the day in Michigan, told supporters on Sunday they've got \"two days to get this done\", ahead of two large planned rallies in Pennyslvania on Monday. Meanwhile, Trump visited three swing states on Sunday, starting with Pennsylvania and moving on to North Carolina and Georgia, where he told the crowd he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House after the 2020 election. Take a look back at our live blog. By Jessica Riga Thank you for joining us. It's been lovely to have your company throughout the day. We'll be back tomorrow morning to bring you all the latest updates as we enter the final hours of the US election campaign in the lead-up to millions heading to the polls. Looking for more? Bye for now, and we'll see you tomorrow! By Jessica Riga Here's what Kamala Harris and Donald Trump got up to in the final sprint of the US election campaign. Our foreign correspondents Carrington Clarke and Jade Macmillan report from Pennsylvania and Michigan, with analysis from global affairs editor John Lyons. By Andrew Thorpe 7.30's Adam Harvey is in Wisconsin, speaking to voters in one of the \"Blue Wall\" swing states Democrats are counting on to win the election. In Milwaukee, everyday concerns like the price of groceries are taking precendence for some voters over big-picture issues like character or support for democratic institutions, he reports. For many Americans, things are tight. Despite the US economy being strong and unemployment low, the cost of living is high. As a result, many families don't feel like like they're doing well — and that is something Donald Trump has tapped into by asking one simple question: \"Are you doing better than you were four years ago?\" The Maciejewski family are feeling the pinch. Their weekly trip to Costco keeps getting more expensive. \"I'm easily spending $US350 to $US400 ($530 to $605) in a shopping trip,\" Rachel Maciejewski says, as she unloads her shopping on the kitchen bench at her home on the outskirts of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \"… We were living much richer lives when he [Trump] was in office.\" Read the full story at the link below: By Jessica Riga Earlier today, my ABC colleagues were just three rows away from Donald Trump when the former US president – behind bulletproof glass – said any assassin would have to \"shoot through the fake news\", before adding \"and I don't mind that much\". Clare Corbould, an associate professor of history at Deacon University, says while the rhetoric isn't new, Donald Trump's remarks are beginning to garner more critical attention. \"Trump has been inciting violence against journalists at his rallies for years and years,\" she told ABC News Channel. \"You might remember one of the catch cries of his first period of office was 'fake news media'. So, in some respects, what he's doing is not new. \"It is striking that the attention and the tone of the coverage of Trump just – I think, since the Maddison Square Garden rally a few days ago, a week ago – I think it has shifted quite strikingly.\" Ms Corbould says \"I don't think I'd be saying anything new in pointing out that he is trying to sow the seeds of an argument that the election has been stolen again. \"Last time it was early voting and mail voting, this time it's whatever he can muster, I think, just to try to have people think perhaps this election is rigged in some way just in case he loses. \"The best antidote to that I suspect is Kamala Harris getting a very, very decisive win.\" By Andrew Thorpe It's almost 3am in Georgia and we're still unpacking some of the comments made by Donald Trump at his rally in Macon the previous evening. One line that seems to have been glossed over by a lot of media outlets — presumably because, as is often the case with Trump, it seems to have been made up on the spot — was his declaration he'd put former NFL running back and Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker in charge of a new US missile defence system. \"We will build a missile defence shield, all made in the USA, wrapped around our country, to defend ourselves and out country … we'll put Herschel Walker in charge of that little sucker, OK?\" Trump said. Trump has in the past expressed admiration for Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system, which is estimated to have saved thousands of lives over the past decade by defending Israeli citizens from rocket attacks. Expanding such a system to cover a country the size of the United States was described earlier this year as \"unrealistic, unafforable and unachievable\" by the former head of the US Northern Command, the military command that would be the main line of defence against an invasion of the US. For his part, Walker, who in 2022 lost an extremely winnable Senate race to Democrat Raphael Warnock, earlier took to the stage for his first appearance of the presidential campaign and urged Americans to vote for \"Donald Trump Jr\", before catching himself and switching his endorsement to \"Jonald J Trump.\" By Tessa Flemming  Elections are an expensive business in America and most people favour spending limits for political campaigns.

By Jessica Riga With the US election just days away the race for votes in the swing states is heating up and things are tighter than many outside the US might expect. 7.30's Adam Harvey is in Milwaukee where the New York Times/Siena poll has Kamala Harris ahead with 49 per cent of the vote to Donald Trump's 48 per cent. Asked if she was shocked Trump was so close to a second term in the White House, this voter said she was. \"I go to bed at night and pray. That's what I go to bed doing,\" she said. \"I just can't believe it. \"I am praying that the women go in and vote for Kamala, even though their husband's think they're voting for someone else.\" Other voters in the state were decidedly pro-Trump, citing his business skills and the rising cost of living as reasons to elect him. But for those in Wisconsin voting Democrat, this vote came down to two issues: Trump's past history of lies and women's right to choose when it comes to abortion. Watch the full report tonight from Wisconsin, live on ABC iview. By Jessica Riga Any fans of The Rest is Politics US reading along? Well, good news, because the podcast co-host is appearing on Q+A tonight. For the uninitiated, Anthony Scaramucci worked for Donald Trump for just 10 days back in 2017. He was hired by the then-US president to be the communications director in the White House, before being promptly dismissed not even a fortnight after being hired. Scaramucci is part of cohort of people who have previously worked for Trump before turning on him, with Scaramucci calling the former US president \"an orange wrecking ball\" earlier this year. Recently, Scaramucci has soared up the charts thanks to co-hosting the US arm of The Rest is Politics, a wildly successful (and originally UK-based) podcast hosted by Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart. Q+A host Patricia Karvelas will be joined by Scaramucci and: You can catch Q+A tonight on ABC TV and ABC iview at 9:35pm AEDT. By Andrew Thorpe Kamala Harris will spend Monday in the key \"Blue Wall\" swing state of Pennsylvania, her campaign says, appearing at a daytime rally in Pittsburgh followed by a star-studded event in Philadelphia. Harris will be joined by Katy Perry at Pittsburgh's Carrie Furnaces, a retired blast furnace that serves as a tourist attraction for people interested in the region's collapsed steel industry. The event was originally scheduled to take place in Point State Park, but had to be moved earlier today due to Secret Service concerns. Harris will then travel to Philadelphia, where Lady Gaga will headline an evening event, alongside Oprah Winfrey, Ricky Martin, The Roots, DJ Jazzy Jeff and other entertainers. Trump, too, is holding a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday, appearing at the PPG Paints Arena (home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins). City officials are reportedly sending some workers home early because of the expected traffic impacts of duelling presidential rallies on the same day. By Tessa Flemming  Satirising political figures has been a Saturday Night Live (SNL) hallmark for the 50 years the show has been running. In that time, it's hosted its fair share of them too. From Trump to Gerald Ford — here's my colleagues Georgie Hewson and Hanan Dervisevic breaking down why US politicians love to use the comedy skit show to win over voters. By Andrew Thorpe Donald Trump was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Thursday — his first visit to the city since 2019. That could be because the last time he was there, his campaign left the city with an unpaid bill of $US211,176 for rally security and public safety, according to local officials. With interest, that amount has since grown to $US444,986 (about $673,000). Mayor Tim Keller told ABC News America the city had sent bills to Mar-a-Lago in Florida and Trump Tower in New York, and a collection agency was also working to recover the debt. However, it doesn't look like he's holding out much hope. By Jessica Riga After a long, long, long campaign, our team of correspondents sit down in Washington with Casey Briggs to dissect all the ups, downs and roundabouts of the US election. By Tessa Flemming  A pro-Harris ad making an explicit play for women is the latest subject of outrage among conservative pundits. The video, narrated by Julia Roberts, from non-profit organisation Vote Common Good, shows a couple entering the polling booth in patriotic caps. The woman then locks eyes with another woman as she votes for Kamala Harris. \"Did you make the right choice?\" her husband asks. \"Sure did, honey,\" his wife responds with a smile, sharing a knowing glance with the woman beside her. Vote Common Good is an anti-Republican organisation aimed at mobilising Evangelical and Catholic voters. The ad touches on an increasing refrain that some women in swing states may vote in secret for Harris rather than Trump.  The reaction from Trump's supporters was swift. Trump told Fox News that he was \"so disappointed\" with Roberts and that she would \"look back and cringe\". \"I mean, can you imagine a wife not telling her husband who she's voting for?\" Trump said.  \"Even if you have a horrible, if you had a bad relationship, you're going to tell your husband.\" Fox News host Jesse Watters said on air that if his wife did the same as the women in the ad, it would violate \"the sanctity of our marriage\". Former House speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News that Democrats were telling wives to lie to their husbands. \"What kind of a totally amoral, corrupt, sick system have the Democrats developed?\" he said. By Jessica Riga US presidential elections rely on thousands of people coming together to scrutinise and then certify the results. So what would happen if they just refused to do that part of the process for political reasons? Matt Bevan takes a look. Looking for more episodes of America's Last Election? Stream them all anytime, anywhere here on ABC iview. By Andrew Thorpe We reported earlier that at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday night, Donald Trump said he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House. \"I shouldn't have left, I mean, honestly,\" he said. \"Because we did so — we did so well, we had such a great — so now, I mean, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.\" It's worth remembering that in the lead-up to Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021, there was a real possibility we were going to see a physical confrontation in the Oval Office, with Trump refusing to confirm he would leave peacefully until just two weeks prior. In public, Trump didn't concede Biden would be taking power until January 7, the day after his supporters' failed attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election by storming Congress (for which Trump is currently facing criminal charges). In private, Trump was reportedly more definitive about his plans. \"I'm just not going to leave,\" Trump told one White House aide, according to The New York Times's Maggie Haberman. \"We're never leaving,\" he told another, adding: \"How can you leave when you won an election?\" It's why we saw experts having to confirm the powers of the presidency would transfer automatically to Mr Biden at midnight on January 20, regardless of who was physically in the White House — and that Secret Service agents would be charged with forcibly removing Trump from the premises if he refused to go on his own volition. \"The Secret Service would escort him off, they would treat him like any old man who'd wandered on the property,\" one former transition official told Newsweek. In the end, Trump went peacefully — January 6 aside — but chose to give a farewell speech at a military base, rather than take part in the traditional handover or attend Biden's inauguration, as Barack Obama had attended his. Boarding Marine One as he left the White House, he said goodbye to reporters and a selection of staff — but added a caveat. \"Hopefully it's not a long-term goodbye. We'll see each other again,\" he said. By Matt Bevan Judith asks: It feels like what would be fringe here (Katter, Hanson) is mainstream in the Republican Party now. How? And Could that happen here? Interesting question, Judith. A good way to think about the American political system is to see the two major parties as broad coalitions. While in Australia we have a number of minor parties represented in parliament, both in the upper and lower house thanks in part to our preferential voting system, the \"first past the post\" system used in most American elections makes it very difficult for minor parties to compete. But that doesn't mean the fringes of the political spectrum aren't represented in the US. Instead, the parties include lots of different types of people. The Democrats, for example, have left-wing firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the same tent as moderates like Joe Biden. In Australia, \"AOC\" and Joe Biden might find themselves in different parties that may need to form coalitions to pass legislation. Thanks to this, party discipline in the US is particularly complex. Members of Congress may choose to vote with the opposite party on any bill. This is one of the things that has made figures like former speaker Nancy Pelosi so powerful. She had a strong ability to ensure Democrats with diverse points of view voted along the party line most of the time. The Republican Party is still a broad coalition of lots of different perspectives, but Donald Trump appears to have a similar level of talent to Pelosi — albeit via very different methods — when it comes to getting party members to stick to his agenda. If he loses this election, his power over Congress may wane. If he wins, he will likely wield an incredible amount of influence over congressional Republicans. *This question was asked earlier in the day.* By Jessica Riga You've likely already seen that Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) overnight, which airs on NBC. But according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the 90-second sketch may have violated the agency's \"equal-time\" rules, which require licensed broadcasters to offer all major candidates a platform. The FCC's former general counsel Brendan Carr took to X to call the SNL sketch a \"clear and blatant effort\" to evade the rules. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct — a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election,\" Carr wrote online. Now, US media is reporting NBC gave Donald Trump's campaign commercial time in response, including an ad during the network's NASCAR coverage. Since Harris's appearance on SNL ran for about 90 seconds, under the FCC's equal time rules, the broadcaster would have to give another candidate the same amount of airtime if requested. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Trump spoke directly to camera during the 60 second spot, meaning another 30 second ad could technically still run. Trump wore a red Make America Great Again baseball cap, and claimed that electing Harris would cause a \"depression\" and that viewers should \"go and vote.\" The Hollywood Reporter noted the ad ran technically after the NASCAR race had ended, but while coverage was still airing. By Jessica Riga It is the dissonance at the heart of Kamala Harris's campaign that tells the story of where we are at in 2024, writes Patricia Karvelas. While she is relying on women — a literal femininomenon — to come out to vote in what could be the most gendered election in history, she has barely spoken a word about her own identity as a black woman and the history-making she is embarking on. So potent is the backlash against identity politics, Harris has been largely and deliberately silent on the historic nature of her candidacy and potential victory. If history is about to be made, it could be made by swing-state women in secret — breaking from their husbands and Trump-loving communities. There is a dystopian quality to this campaign that has confounded me. You can continue reading this analysis from Patricia Karvelas at the link below. By Andrew Thorpe Good afternoon — I'm joining Jessica Riga on the blog until this evening. Probably the biggest mystery to Australians following this election remains the Electoral College — indeed, it's not something every American seems to be across, either. We've been fielding questions for a long time now asking what it is, whether it's a real institution populated by real people, and why the presidency isn't simply won by whichever candidate gets the most votes. Need a quick refresher on how it works? The team over at ABC Story Lab has prepared a fantastic interactive explainer breaking it down — and why 270 is the key number both campaigns have been working towards. By Matt Bevan Gordon asks: If Trump loses this election will the Republicans find a new leader and change direction or are they now so committed to MAGA that they are irreversibly locked in to this populist agenda? Jake asks: What would happen to the MAGA movement if Trump loses? What's the risk of Trump running again at age 82? If Donald Trump loses the election, the Republican Party is unlikely to nominate him again. Ever since Donald Trump's surprise victory in 2016, the Republicans have performed generally quite poorly in elections up and down the ballot. Some put this poor performance down to Trump's influence on candidate selection. Candidates in tight races who are personally endorsed by Donald Trump tend to do well in primary races, but poorly in general elections. But is that because Trump endorsed them or because they are adherents of Trumpism? A big question the Republicans would need to answer is about what happens when Trump-style populism is separated from Donald Trump himself. If, say, the current Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance were to run for president next time, campaigning with the same policies as Donald Trump, but without Trump's personal baggage, would he perform better? The Kamala Harris campaign is spending a lot of time and energy campaigning against Donald Trump, rather than against Trumpism. They attack his age, his ability to speak coherently, his legal history, his connection to the January 6 riot, and other things. JD Vance, or another candidate pursuing Trump's policies, would potentially be a more difficult target for Democrats to hit. But then again, could Vance, or anyone else, get the Republican base to turn out at the level they do for Trump? Sorry, that didn't really answer your question. And, of course, Trump could definitely still win on Tuesday, in which case the point is moot. *This question was asked earlier in the day.* Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Jacquelyn Martin ) Kamala Harris has become the latest in a long line of US presidential candidates to appear on US sketch show Saturday Night Live in an effort to show their lighter side. A clip of Ms Harris playing herself alongside Maya Rudolph, who frequently impersonates her, has attracted millions of views since their sketch went to air over the weekend. Satirising political figures has been a Saturday Night Live (SNL) hallmark for the 50 years the show has been running. Republican and Democratic presidential candidates and US politicians have appeared on the show in an attempt to win over voters. Let's take a look back at some of the most memorable and criticised appearances by US political figures. While Donald Trump hasn't appeared on the show during this year's campaign, he is no stranger to the SNL stage. In 2015, when he was the frontrunner to be the Republican candidate for the 2016 election, Trump hosted SNL. During his monologue, he spoke of his intention to become US president and poked fun at SNL cast members' impressions of him. While the sketch got some laughs, it prompted outrage from Latino activists who protested against what they called Trump's racist views on immigration. Demonstrators protest against Donald Trump's views on immigration hours before he hosts Saturday Night Live. (AP: Katie Park) The New York Times criticised his appearance as \"unfunny and cringeworthy\". In 2017, former SNL cast member Taran Killam, who appeared alongside Trump in his monologue, called the former president's appearance \"embarrassing and shameful\". \"It was not enjoyable at the time and something that only grows more embarrassing and shameful as time goes on,\" he said. However, Trump's appearance drew close to 10 million views. Trump also appeared in 2004. In 2016, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, appeared on the season opener of Saturday Night Live. But not as herself. Most political candidates play themselves often for just a cameo in a sketch or to declare the show's famous tagline: \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night.\" Instead, Ms Clinton played Val the bartender in a sketch opposite resident SNL Clinton impersonator Kate McKinnon. The skit poked gentle fun at Ms Clinton's slow opposition to the Keystone pipeline, her late-arriving support of same-sex marriage and her inability to take a holiday. As Val, Ms Clinton also did an impression of Trump with a hoarse rendition of his statement, \"Uh, you're all losers,\" prompting McKinnon to break into laughter. Time Magazine said Ms Clinton played \"the very role that her campaign has sought for months to cast her as: a real person\". \"The appearance poked fun at the problems that have nagged Clinton the most during her campaign, and highlighted some of her candidate's strengths.\" It was Ms Clinton's second appearance on SNL. She previously participated in a sketch during a 2008 episode when Amy Poehler was tasked with impersonating her. Barack Obama was still just a Democratic presidential candidate when he appeared on SNL in 2007. The sketch featured Poehler and Darrell Hammond as Bill and Hillary Clinton hosting a Halloween party. Mr Obama entered towards the end of the sketch, wearing a mask of himself. \"I have nothing to hide,\" Mr Obama said. \"I enjoy being myself. I'm not going to change who I am just because it's Halloween.\" Meanwhile, as Ms Clinton, Amy Poehler wore a white bridal gown but was mocked in the skit by a fake Bill Clinton who was calling it a witch's outfit. It was Kamala Harris's first time on the show, which has had other presidential candidates over its decades-long run. The New York Times said Mr Obama's few lines in the skit echoed his refrain that he was \"more genuine than Mrs Clinton\". The skit was dissected on the internet, with many people applauding its wit, but some suggested it was too gentle on Mr Obama. The episode also almost included a controversial sketch about racial profiling on airplanes until the presidential hopeful turned down the idea. Then-Republican vice-presidential candidate and Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, who was famously parodied by Tina Fey, appeared on the show in October 2008. Ms Palin was John McCain's running mate in the 2008 US election which was won by Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Ms Palin first featured in the show's opening sequence which showed her telling creator Lorne Michaels she was not impressed by Fey's constant impersonations of her during her campaign. During the sketch, she was mistaken for Fey by Alec Baldwin, who joked she was \"way hotter in person\" and laughed about her nickname \"Caribou Barbie\". Later in the show, she joined Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers for the Weekend Update sketch, where she bopped along to a rap song she joked she was not going to perform herself due to worries \"it might just cross the line\". Poehler got up and performed the rap instead. Her appearance was seen by more than 14 million people, the largest audience for SNL since 1994. The New York Times said the appearance showed \"she had a sense of humour at a time when the country is still debating whether to take her seriously as a potential commander in chief\". In April 1976, then-president Gerald Ford appeared alongside his press secretary Ron Nessen, who hosted the show after much deliberation. Ron Nessen (left) and Chevy Chase, who is impersonating Gerald Ford in a Saturday Night Live sketch in 1976.  (Getty Images: File) Less than a year after the show first premiered, Ford became the first president to appear on SNL and utter the famous phrase: \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" Time Magazine, which called the episode the one that \"changed American politics\", said after taking over from president Richard Nixon following the Watergate scandal, Mr Ford and his secretary's appearance was an effort to change perceptions of his administration. Mr Nessen, who even played himself in an opening sketch with Chevy Chase, said he wanted to host the show to prove \"that this administration has a sense of humour\". Former US president Gerald Ford was criticised for his appearance on SNL.  (Getty Images: File) In Nessen's memoir, It Sure Looks Different from the Inside, he said reviews were \"not kind\" and many told him appearing on the show was a \"gross error of judgment\". Despite the criticisms levelled at the president and press secretary at the time, a long list of US political figures followed in their footsteps. Longtime Arizona senator and two-time presidential candidate John McCain, who died at age 81 in 2017, took to the SNL stage several times. In 2002 he became the first sitting senator to ever host SNL. He appeared again in 2008, during the midst of his presidential campaign. Throughout the bit, McCain unveiled new strategies to beat his opponent Barack Obama in the polls. The Washington Post said his \"sense of humour shined through\" especially when he suggested his \"Sad Grandpa\" strategy. \"I ask you, what should we be looking for in our next president? Certainly, someone who is very, very, very old.\" This episode was the highest-rating season finale in three years, NBC said. But McCain did not stop there. Three days before the presidential election that year, he returned alongside Tina Fey as his much-mocked running mate Sarah Palin. Sarah Palin and John McCain in 2010. (Reuters: Joshua Lott) Off the back of Mr Obama's expensive 30-minute campaign ad, Mr McCain and Fey poked fun at his presidential campaign's financial shortcomings with painful honesty. \"I'm a true maverick, a Republican without money,\" he said. \"This past Wednesday, Barack Obama purchased airtime on three major networks. \"We, however, can only afford QVC.\" QVC is an American cable shopping network.

(Reuters: Nathan Howard) Few things can command the attention of just about all of Parliament House in Canberra, particularly on a busy sitting day. But when polls close in the US next Wednesday morning (Australian time), you can guarantee eyes will be glued to the election night count. It is undoubtedly a hugely consequential election for the United States, with two presidential candidates offering a vastly different vision of the next four years. The US election polls will close on Wednesday morning.  (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz/Rebecca Cook) But given the enormous global influence of the US, the consequences spread well beyond its borders — including across the Pacific, and onto Australian shores. The US is Australia's most important military ally, one of our biggest trading partners and a critical diplomatic partner in the Indo-Pacific. So what would a Trump victory, or a Harris victory, mean for trade? For AUKUS? Or climate? Here's what the outcome might mean for Australia. There are a range of very tangible possible consequences from next week's election, such as new tariffs that might impact Australia, or a withdrawal from global efforts to combat climate change. But some foreign policy experts point to a less easily measured impact as potentially bringing the greatest consequence. Michael Fullilove from the Lowy Institute said Australia should be worried about the unpredictability and instability that could come from the election result, particularly if it was contested. If you're just tuning in as the campaign trail nears its end, here's what you need to know about this year's US election.  \"It's in Australia's interests when the United States is well governed, cohesive, attractive and strong. So I hope that we don't see any repeat of the January 6 crisis of political violence,\" he said. \"I hope that the loser accepts defeat. \"And I hope that whomever is elected governs well. Foreign policy begins at home; if you're not strong at home, you can't be strong abroad.\" Aside from the many 'firsts' that come with Kamala Harris's campaign — like being the first Black woman to run for president — she is seen as a fairly conventional candidate, who would run a fairly standard administration. Donald Trump is deliberately offering quite the opposite. Michael Fullilove said there are lessons from Mr Trump's first turn as president in dealing with an unpredictable, and at times impulsive, administration. Republican presidential nominee, former US president Donald Trump. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) He said those who managed Mr Trump best did so respectfully, but without simply playing to his ego. \"The best way to manage your relationship with Mr.Trump is to be pragmatic,\" he said. \"Don't sneer at him, but don't gush at him either. Show him respect in public, but stand your ground in private.\" There's little doubt that a new Trump administration would make tariffs a big feature of its trade agenda. And given the US is Australia's third-largest two-way trading partner, those could directly hit local industries. Donald Trump has promised a tariff of 10 to 20 per cent on all imported goods. He argues it would prove to be a huge revenue-raiser for the government, and help make American manufacturing more competitive. There is no clarity on how that would work with the United States' many trade agreements, including the Australia-US free trade agreement, which makes the vast bulk of Australia's exports tariff-free. Donald Trump has promised a tariff of 10 to 20 per cent on all imported goods. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) During the last Trump administration, Australia avoided new tariffs on steel with some careful diplomacy. But whatever impacts Australia might cop, they will likely pale in comparison to what is heading China's way. Trump is promising a 60 per cent tariff on all goods imported from China, the largest source of imports into the US. China has warned against the policy, saying it has no interest in a trade war. Voters in seven key battleground states look set to decide who becomes the next US president. This is a snapshot of what they're thinking on the eve of the election. Michael Fullilove said even if Trump can only achieve some of his trade agenda, the impact on Australia would be noticeable. \"He won't do all the things that he's promised to do, but the net effect for a trading country like Australia surely has to be negative,\" he said. The concern is that Australia might be caught in the crossfire — and that a trade war could trigger a slowdown in China's economy, which would drag Australia down with it. It is worth noting that a return to tariffs as trade policy has been somewhat bipartisan in the United States. The Biden administration has chosen not to unwind any of the first Trump administration's tariffs, or revisit his changes to trade deals with countries like Mexico. And it has introduced very heavy tariffs of its own — like a 100 per cent tariff on electric vehicles from China, and substantial hikes to tariffs on steel, semiconductors and solar panels. There is no indication that Kamala Harris would take a different approach to Joe Biden in office. The US election comes at a fairly critical point in global efforts to combat climate change, and the difference in position between the two candidates could not be more stark. Donald Trump's position on climate can be neatly summated in his own words — \"drill, baby, drill\". Mr Trump's overriding stance is that little to no effort should be made to combat climate change, and the US should focus on its strengths in oil and gas. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) He has called climate change \"one of the greatest scams of all time\" and has pledged to \"unleash American oil and natural gas production\", pushing through approvals for new projects. He has similarly pledged to unwind federal support for many renewables, particularly wind power. On the global front, he would pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement for the second time, having made the same step during his first term in office. But he could go further this time, potentially withdrawing the US from the broader UN-led framework to combat climate change, which would be a more permanent step than simply pulling out of Paris. Australia is a signatory to Paris, and along with 194 other signatories, will have to in coming months stump up a 2035 emissions target. Richie Merzian, chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, said one advantage for countries working towards addressing climate change is what they learned from the last time Trump was in power. Democratic presidential nominee and US Vice-President, Kamala Harris. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) He said one encouraging sign from the last Trump administration was a counter-effort within the US to act on climate, led by state and city administrations. \"What you did see was this huge coalition built by state governments and by cities in the US that collectively represented the third largest economy in the world,\" he said. \"There's a lot of support for climate action in the US that will continue despite Trump.\" Kamala Harris would likely keep up the momentum built by the current president, Joe Biden, through his signature Inflation Reduction Act. The bill included $578 billion in spending on climate efforts, mostly tax credits for renewable energy projects. Donald Trump is no fan of the Inflation Reduction Act, but given it has been legislated, and much of its funding has already been spent or committed, he would have a hard time totally unpicking it. There is no indication that Kamala Harris would take a different approach to Joe Biden in office. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein) The bill sparked a flurry of similar investment in countries across the globe competing to build new renewable industries — including the Albanese government's move towards tax credits for sectors like renewable hydrogen. Climate hasn't been a central feature of Kamala Harris' campaign — she mentioned it just once in her 40-minute speech to the Democratic National Convention. And while her campaign promotes the Biden administration's efforts to boost renewable power, it also highlights increases in US oil production. But climate advocates think that has more to do with politics, than a lack of interest in the issue. They argue there would be little to gain for Harris in campaigning on climate, given voters with an interest in the issue are unlikely to back Donald Trump. Richie Merzian said those in climate policy know Kamala Harris, and are confident she will be active on the issue. \"Kamala Harris is a well known entity,\" he said. \"She attended the last COP (UN climate summit) in Dubai as vice-president, and has a history as a litigator against fossil fuel companies. \"So her leadership on this issue stands, regardless of how prominent this is in the election.\" The AUKUS agreement has moved to the centre of the Australia-US defence relationship, as the military superpower agrees to share its secret nuclear submarine technology. AUKUS is a very long-term arrangement, not delivering its first Australian-built nuclear submarine until the end of the next decade. Staff upheaval and frustrations with leadership are emerging inside the new government agency overseeing the $368 billion AUKUS project. That relies on the consistent agreement of ongoing US administrations, and for now, that looks relatively likely to be the case. Despite her time as vice-president, not much is known about Kamala Harris's approach to foreign policy. Most expect a level of continuity from the Biden administration's approach, including on arrangements like AUKUS. While little is known about how Donald Trump would approach AUKUS, there are some indications that he would be unlikely to totally unwind it. China's role in the Indo-Pacific is a shared concern among Democrats and Republicans, and AUKUS has support across the aisle too. Lowy's Michael Fullilove put a question on AUKUS to Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, months before he became the vice-presidential nominee. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance. (AP: Evan Vucci) \"I asked JD Vance about AUKUS at the Munich Security Conference in February, and he said he's a fan of AUKUS,\" he said. But he warns Donald Trump can be much more unpredictable. \"Trump quite likes reneging on deals that his predecessors have made. So, the risk is that he may push for a better and more lucrative deal for the United States,\" he said. A revamped version of the AUKUS agreement includes indemnity for the US and UK against any radioactive waste accidents. \"He likes to say 'the deal that the last guy did was the worst deal in history, and therefore I need to get more for my side out of this deal'. \"AUKUS will probably be OK. But Canberra can't assume that President Trump wouldn't re-litigate the matter.\" Michael Fullilove said there is no doubt it'll be a nervous few days in Canberra, watching the election play out across the Pacific. \"The US is the most important global actor, the only country that runs a truly global foreign policy,\" he said. \"The US is central to solving almost all of the challenges facing the world. \"Having a president who is successful, who is well informed, who genuinely believes in American greatness is in Australia's interests. \"I think there'll be a significant amount of nervousness in Canberra as the results roll in.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections Government and Politics US Elections Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Eric Gay) A 3,000-kilometre band of heavy rain and thunderstorms is bringing severe wet weather to multiple US states. Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin will be worst affected by the wet weather. Weather could affect voter turnout for the election, but experts say it is too difficult to determine how significant the impact will be. In a country where voting is not compulsory and when the margin of victory is small, the weather has the potential to have an influence on the election results. Research has shown fair weather in 1960 aided Democrat John F Kennedy, while rain in 2000 helped secure Florida and an eventual win to Republican George W Bush. The race to the White House this year between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is a classic case where the atmosphere could be the decisive factor, with a 3,000-kilometre band of heavy rain and thunderstorms forming from Texas to Canada, which is predicted to bring a swathe of severe weather during the next 48 hours over multiple states. Non-resident senior fellow at the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre Professor Benjamin Reilly said the contest between the candidates is one of the tightest in US election history. \"It's too close to call. Opinion polls put it very close,\" he said. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Rosalind Dixon, Professor of Law and Director of the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales, said the race was \"extremely tight\". \"I think that all the polling suggests it is down to a few states, most of which are within the margin of error,\" she said. Professor Reilly said while the severe wet weather would \"negatively affect\" voter turnout, it was too difficult to determine how significant the impact would be for the current election. So could the weather make a difference? During periods of inclement weather, like rain or snow, turnout numbers are impacted for marginal voters who are less politically active. And since people on the periphery of politics are more likely to be working class, the drop in turnout is higher for one party over another. Even without the backdrop of a US election, the current weather system is newsworthy. A very moist airstream of the Gulf of Mexico is feeding into a low pressure system over the central US. A band of heavy rain and thunderstorms is predicted to bring a swathe of severe weather during the next 48 hours over multiple states. (ABC News) This system is already causing severe weather with excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms across most of south-central US on Monday, leading to areas of flooding. This low is slowly moving east and will extend a band of rain and storms from Canada to Texas on Tuesday (US time). The heaviest rain is likely to fall over relatively safe states, including Republican stalwarts in the south and the Democrat-leaning Illinois. However up to 50 millimetres is also possible in critical swing states Wisconsin and Michigan. Professor Dixon said these two states were the ones to \"watch\" because of this reason. While Detroit should remain east of the main rainband, northern Michigan and southern Wisconsin, including Milwaukee, are likely to be blanketed by the rainband for the majority of voting hours on Tuesday. Several studies looking into the weather's influence on elections across the world and the results are clear — rain and snow have a significant impact on voter turnout. A 2023 study on Denmark elections showed rainfall dropped participation by 1 per cent per 10mm. Studies have shown rain and snow negatively impact turnout, but supporters attending this Trump rally weren't deterred. (AP: Charlie Riedel) A 2007 study analysed US elections and found that when compared to normal conditions, rain reduces voter participation by a rate of just less than 1 per cent per inch, or 1 per cent per 25mm. That could mean a drop of 2 per cent in participation in Michigan, Wisconsin and other counties affected by the heaviest falls (and even higher in states further south where 100mm is possible). A separate weather system dropping snow on Montana is also likely to lower turnout, but its unlikely to prevent a safe win for Trump. So does rain or snow favour one party over another? The old adage \"Republicans should pray for rain\", has been found to be accurate during past US elections. As the theory went, bad weather may be the last straw for peripheral voters, especially young people who have not developed a voting habit, and they were disproportionately inclined to support the Democratic candidate. This link was tested in the Gomez study and the data indicated for every 25mm increase in rain, the Republican presidential candidate received just over 2 per cent of the vote — easily enough to swing a state, and therefore an entire election. Professor Reilly said due to the fact generally staunch Republican states in the south — Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas — will be the worst affected by the rainband, it would impact the overall vote share for the party. However, going by academic studies including the study by Gomez, Professor Reilly said the Republican Party has been \"speculated\" to benefit more from poor weather historically. Professor Dixon said she suspected the weather would have \"a very modest impact\". \"If you're asking me to bet on it, I would say this won't turn out to be significant. Could it be? Absolutely,\" she said. \"Weather adds just one more element of uncertainty in an already enormously close, uncertain election.\" Professor Rosalind Dixon said the severe wet weather adds \"one more element of uncertainty\" to the election. (Supplied) Professor Dixon said \"more determined\" and \"politically engaged\" voters would turn up, regardless of the weather.  \"There are definitely motivated voters on both sides, and I think it is very relevant to say weather is a factor and we should be paying attention to it. \"But I think it's very ill-advised to be making firm predictions about which way it will cut.\" Indeed, the weather may have contributed to two past electoral college outcomes. In a very tightly contested 1960 election, it is estimated that very rainy or snowy weather would have gained Richard Nixon an additional 106 electoral college votes over John F Kennedy. Use our US presidential election guide to zero-in on the states that matter. The reverse results – if it was dry as opposed to wet, revealed two instances which would have changed an electoral college outcome — Bill Clinton to win North Carolina in 1992 and Al Gore to win Florida in 2000. This latter change would have swung the incredibly close 2000 election in Mr Gore's favour over George W Bush. However recent evidence shows this pattern may have reversed, as working class voters now lean more towards the Republican Party and college-educated voters to the Democrats. A paper by Spencer Goidel and co-authors in 2023 showed the shift in turnout by studying US federal elections from 2010 to 2020. \"Our findings show that increases in turnout greatly benefit the Democratic Party in the pre-Trump era. However, this pattern has drastically changed. In 2016, 2018, and 2020, the Democratic Party sees a much smaller gain in vote share as simulated turnout increases, but also a large vote share advantage when voter turnout is extremely low.\" This implies Mr Trump should perhaps pray for sunshine rather than rain over Michigan and Wisconsin on Tuesday.

Trump announced a tariff on Mexico if the country doesn't stop immigrants crossing the border. Harris and Trump both appear in Pennsylvania tonight with celebrities and supporters. If there was any question about where the White House is likely to be won and lost, today's election-eve campaign blitz should provide the answer. Both presidential candidates held multiple rallies in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven swing states likely to determine the US election result. The \"blue wall\" state is considered something of a must-win, particularly for Kamala Harris. No Democratic candidate has won an election without winning Pennsylvania since 1948. Ms Harris brought a roster of big celebrity names as she held rallies in the state's two largest cities, while Donald Trump hoped a female-focused event in a smaller city will improve his standing with women. Trump used the Raleigh campaign stop to threaten Mexico with new tariffs if Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum doesn't stop immigrants crossing the US border. \"I haven't met her, and I'm going to inform her on day one or sooner, that if they don't stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I'm going to immediately impose a 25 per cent tariff on everything they send into the United States of America,\" he said. \"It's only got a 100 per cent chance of working, because if that doesn't work, I'll make it 50, and [if] that doesn't work, I'll make it 75. For the tough guys, and I'll make it 100,\" Trump said, adding Mexico would be forced to send soldiers to its southern borders with Guatemala and Belize to stop migrants. Trump, who spoke for more than 90 minutes, said the pace of the campaign did not bother him. \"I don't even sleep,\" he declared. He claimed Mexico was the US biggest trading partner, but it's not — it's second to Canada as the largest recipient of American goods and the second largest importer to America after China, which Trump has also threatened with a 60 per cent tariff during the campaign. Economists have criticised Trump's reliance on tariffs, which could stoke inflation, affect global supply chains and lead to retaliation. Once again in Raleigh, Trump said that while voters rate the economy and the cost of living as their top issues, he thought controlling immigration was more important. With election-day polling opening in less than 24 hours and early and mail-in voting well underway, the race is still too close to call. In Pennsylvania, the FiveThirtyEight polling average for the state still has the two candidates tied on 47.8 per cent each. Polls in the other swing states are also stubbornly tight. As of early November 4, local time, Trump was about 1 percentage point ahead in Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, and has a 2.5 per cent lead in Arizona.  Harris was less than a percentage point ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin. The Democratic camp was buoyed this week by shock Iowa polling that has them 3 percentage points ahead of Trump, whose team dismissed the result, which was in the margin of error, as \"fake\". Back in Pennsylvania, pop singer Katy Perry and DJ D-Nice are hoping to give Harris a boost when they perform at her event in Pittsburgh on Monday. Singers Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, DJ Jazzy Jeff and TV star Oprah Winfrey are among the special guests appearing in Philadelphia. Harris is hoping another rally in the state will capitalise on anger in the Puerto Rican community, after a comedian at a Trump event called the US territory a \"floating island of garbage\". Voters in seven key battleground states look set to decide who becomes the next US president. This is a snapshot of what they're thinking on the eve of the election. At the event, Venezuelan-born Angel Sarmiento, who recently moved from South Carolina to Pittsburgh, said she is voting for Ms Harris for a \"multitude of reasons\", but the comments made at Trump's event were \"the cherry on top\". \"I'm seeing people on social media and stuff, Hispanics especially, having that be the kind of push to tip them over to vote for Kamala,\" she said. Trump has said he didn't know who the comedian was, but he didn't think the joke was \"a big deal\". Genia Williams thinks it has \"tipped the scales hugely\" in Pennsylvania. \"You know, that 'garbage pile in the ocean', that was a gift to us,\" she said. \"That's a huge population. There's 450,000 here in Pennsylvania alone.\" At Ms Harris’s rally in Pittsburgh, some attendees believe a roundly condemned joke at a recent Trump event could prove costly. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Trump was scheduled to appear in Pittsburgh around the same time as Harris, just a short walk from where her rally was being held. The vice-president's team announced a venue change the day before her rally, reportedly because the Secret Service had raised safety concerns. Trump is also continuing to campaign in the state, where he has been fuelling conspiracy theories about election theft. \"They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing,\" he told a rally in the Pennsylvania borough of Lititz on Sunday, local time, without providing evidence. Speaking to Trump supporters queuing up for his Pittsburgh rally, all mention the same thing: a deep distrust of the electoral process, and of the polls that suggest Pennsylvania is neck-and-neck. Some suspect America is in for a shock similar to 2016, when polls predicted a Hillary Clinton victory. \"I don't know one conservative who would respond to a poll,\" said Winkie Ilic, from the small borough of Seven Fields outside Pittsburgh. \"We, as a rule, don't. So that's why we don't trust the polls at all.\" Winkie Ilic and John Mueller, at a Trump rally in Pittsburgh, don't trust what polls are reporting.  (ABC News: Brad Ryan) John Mueller, from Pittsburgh, also doesn't believe the state is tied. \"Not from what I'm seeing on the ground,\" he said. \"A lot of Trump supporters, a lot of Trump yard signs and a lot of support.\" The competing rallies mean the city's public schools decided to close early, for fears of traffic chaos later in the day. Trump also held a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, as part of what's been billed the \"Team Trump Women's Tour\". It's part of an effort to close a significant gender gap that has Ms Harris well ahead of Trump with female voters, according to polls.

Here's where the race will be decided. To secure the presidency, Kamala Harris or Donald Trump needs to win the majority of votes in the US electoral college. There are 538 electoral college votes, so whoever reaches 270 wins. (Or they're tied at 269 each, but for all our sakes let's not focus on that right now…) This map takes the shape of the United States and tweaks it a bit to show how many votes each state has in the electoral college. Each hexagon is one vote. Most states tend to vote fairly predictably from election to election, providing a stable base of likely electoral college votes for both Harris and Trump. Let's take a look. First off, here are all the parts of the country regarded as solid Trump states, based on ratings from the independent experts at Cook Political Report. And now in a lighter shade we'll add the states it ranks as likely for Trump. It's not enough to get him to that crucial 270 number, but he's well on his way. Now let's do the same thing for Harris, adding her solid states in dark blue. Plus, in a lighter shade, those where Harris is rated likely to win. So Harris too is short of the magic 270 — and the election hangs in the balance. Let's fade those coloured-in parts of the country to bring into focus the seven toss-up states, where the candidates are essentially neck-and-neck. It might help to think of them like this… Three in the north-east: Three in what's sometimes called the \"sun belt\" running across the south: And one in the west: Barring any big surprises, this is where the presidential race will be decided. Harris's most straightforward path to victory comes through the states in the north-east — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They're sometimes called the \"blue wall\" because if Democrats can win all of them, they're close to assured of winning the election. In 2020, Joe Biden won all three with slim margins, and polling suggests it will be another very tight race this year. Both parties have focused a good deal of their campaigns on these states. If Harris can hold onto the blue wall and avoid any surprises elsewhere, she'll scrape in a victory with precisely 270 electoral college votes … even if Trump claims every other battleground state. But Trump also has a history of success at toppling the blue wall. He might have lost them to Biden in 2020, but he won all three to seize victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. If Trump ekes out wins in the south and the west, he only needs to win one north-eastern state. Even taking the smallest of the three blue wall states, Wisconsin, would be enough to return him to the White House. And polling suggests he's well and truly in the running in all three. Michigan is home to one of the country's largest populations of Arab Americans, who traditionally vote largely for the Democrats. But their anger over Biden's largely unwavering support for Israel's brutal campaign in Gaza has put that advantage in doubt, helping make it another possible tipping point for Trump. Of course, these are just a few of the scenarios for a Trump or Harris victory. With seven states in the balance, there are more than a dozen possible final combinations that could flip the election one way or the other. The New York Times and political website 538 keep track of polls around the country, averaging all their results in an attempt to come up with a more accurate picture than any single poll can provide. Here's what the outcome would look like if those polling averages are perfectly accurate — right down to the decimal point. Trump would win, with 287 to 251 electoral college votes. On the other hand, here's what the outcome of the election would be if the final New York Times and Siena poll of the campaign is accurate. It paints a very different picture of the outcome — with Trump and Harris splitting the \"blue wall\" states and the southern \"sun belt\" states between them. Crucially, the NYT/Siena poll rates Pennsylvania as \"even\". The race is so close, it can't split the candidates. But even with that unresolved, Harris would squeak over the line. But here's the thing. All polls have a margin of error, and realistically the overall race — and the individual races in the key states — are too close to call. It's effectively a dead heat in the polls. However, that doesn't mean it'll be a dead heat on the day. If there's a polling error similar to those seen in 2020 — when Trump significantly outperformed the polls (but lost) — then he would sweep all of the swing states for a comprehensive victory. On the flip side, if there's a polling error similar to that in key Senate races in 2022 — when Democrat candidates outperformed — it'll be an historic win for Harris. And let's take that uncertainty one step further. One crucial poll released days out from the election shows Harris winning Iowa — which is outside the group of crucial toss-up states. In fact, it's rated by Cook Political Report as \"solid\" for Trump. As ever, we need to be careful about reading too much into any single poll. But if this one proves prescient (as it has before), then it'll reshape the map — and the election. And Iowa is just one possible example. The race is so tight that only a fool would rule out the chances of a shock result coming from outside the key swing states. There is a total of 538 electoral college votes up for grabs, meaning it's possible both candidates could end up with an equal split. Here's one way a draw could play out. If a tie happens, it will be up to Congress to decide who wins the presidency. There's only ever been one tie in US history, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr in 1800. (Jefferson famously became president.) In 2024, the first states are expected to be called for Harris and Trump on Wednesday morning. If the election is as tight as predicted, it could be days before the winner is known.

You can follow the latest from the US election in today's US election blog. Millions of Americans have begun to head to the polls to decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump should win the race to the White House. By Georgie Hewson It is a new day here in Australia so we are switching over to a new blog. We will continue to bring you the latest on election day so please join us. You can follow it here: By Georgie Hewson It seems an apt time to remind us all which states we should be paying close attention to. This year there's seven key states including: To read more on how the states will be decided click here: By Doug Dingwall On the same date Americans head to the polls, another election contest unfolding in the Pacific is likely being watched in both Washington DC and Beijing. Palau, an island nation of 18,000 people, will elect its president today following a campaign pitting the incumbent Surangel Whipps Jr against former president Tommy Remengesau Jr — who happens to be President Whipps' brother-in-law. It is one of three remaining Pacific countries that recognise Taiwan, and while neither candidate is campaigning on changing that, Palau's foreign relations have figured in this election. Both candidates support the US military's engagement with Palau, although Mr Remengesau has said addressing climate change is a greater priority for Palau's security than the US-China rivalry, journalist Prianka Srinivasan told the ABC's Pacific Beat last week. Like in many other countries, cost-of-living has weighed heavily on voters. A value-added tax introduced in 2023, as inflation was hurting households, has also been a point of debate, editor of Tia Belau newspaper in Palau, Kambes Kesolei, said. \"The economy hit the people hard, and this tax reform has divided voters,\" Mr Kesolei said. He said the election result would likely be close. By Georgie Hewson US intelligence agencies have also said this year's contest faces an unprecedented disinformation campaign from foreign adversaries and that Russia and others aim to fan divisive narratives amid the election. Russian has denied this accusation. On Monday, US intelligence agencies said they expect overseas influence operations to \"intensify through election day and in the coming weeks,\" particularly in the seven key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. However, US cybersecurity agency director Jen Easterly has said her department has not seen evidence of any activity that could directly impact the outcome of the election, despite the surge in disinformation. U.Sintelligence agencies last week blamed Russia for a false video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant claiming to have voted multiple times in the US state of Georgia. Over the weekend, the FBI warned about several other fake videos. Reporting with Reuters By Georgie Hewson The FBI has warned Americans about two new fake videos falsely citing terror threats and voter fraud, the latest in a string of disinformation that officials expect will intensify as voters head to polls today. One fabricated video purporting to be from the federal law enforcement agency falsely cited a high terror threat and urged Americans to \"vote remotely,\" while another video includes a fake press release alleging to be from the agency and alleging rigged voting among inmates in five prisons. Both are \"not authentic,\" the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. \"Attempts to deceive the public with false content about FBI threat assessments and activities aim to undermine our democratic process and erode trust in the electoral system.\" Federal, state and local officials have urged US voters to seek out credible information from reliable sources. Reporting with Reuters By Georgie Hewson  Across the US, people have been preparing for the presidential elections in their own ways - some getting custom nails, designing signs, and declaring their loyalty to the Harris-Swift-Walz ticket. By Brad Ryan in Pennsylvania Genia Williams is feeling good ahead of the election. She believes the Trump campaign did Kamala Harris a favour in the final stretch. \"You know, that 'garbage pile in the ocean', that was a gift to us,\" she says. In case you missed it, she's referring to the way comedian Tony Hinchcliffe spoke about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally in New York. \"I think that's really tipped the scales, hugely,\" Genia tells me as the crowd builds for Harris's rally in Pittsburgh. \"That's a huge population. There's 450,000 here in Pennsylvania alone. \"And you just think, you have J Lo, you have Bad Bunny ... I think it was a gift.\" Both J Lo and Bad Bunny are Puerto Rican. J Lo told a Harris rally in Las Vegas that \"every Latino in this country\" was offended by the joke. And Bad Bunny declared his support for Harris after the comment. The hugely popular rapper, who was Spotify's most streamed artist in the three years to 2022, shared a video with his 45 million Instagram followers, in which Harris declared there was \"so much at stake in this election for Puerto Rican voters\". By Georgie Hewson Women will play an undeniably pivotal role in this election. Abortion rights has passed inflation as the top issue in the presidential election for women under age 30 since Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee, according to a survey of female voters by KFF. In Scranton, Pennsylvania, Liza Fortt, a 74-year-old Black woman, arrived at her polling location in a wheelchair and not feeling well. But she ventured out anyway to vote for Harris. \"It means a lot to me and my grandkids, my granddaughters, my nieces. … I was just waiting for this day to come,\" Fortt said. She said she never thought she'd have such an opportunity, to cast a ballot for a Black woman in a presidential race. \"I'm proud, to see a woman, not only a woman, but a Black woman,\" Fortt said. Reporting with AP  By Georgie Hewson Good morning to those staying up late or  joining us nice and early. My name is Georgie Hewson and my collegue Andrew Thorpe and I will be taking over the blog now. So top up your coffee cups, crack open your energy drinks with us and follow along as we continue to bring you the latest on election day. By Jessica Riga For most of the year, we've been covering every twist and turn of the US election. From the first debate, to Joe Biden stepping down, to party conventions and controversies galore — now we're reaching the last hours. Here's a refresher of everything that's happened so far. By Tessa Flemming  It's now 10am ET, and more states are opening up including:  By Tessa Flemming  In contrast to Kamala Harris's final tweet, Donald Trump's election day post is quite lengthy. He tells voters today is the \"most important day in American History\" and says enthusiasm is \"THROUGH THE ROOF\". \"That means lines are going to be long!\" he says. \"I need you to deliver your vote no matter how long it takes. STAY IN LINE!\" By Tessa Flemming   Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance has voted in Cincinnati. “Look, I feel good. You never know until you know, but I feel good about this race,” he said after he and his wife cast their ballots. Vance said he would depart for Palm Beach, Florida, later today to be with Donald Trump as results come in. Reporting with AP  By Doug Dingwall Among the first Americans to vote on election day will be residents of the Pacific territories of Guam and the Northern Marianas — each 14 hours ahead of Washington, DC. The thing is, they won't have a say in who becomes president. While they're US territories, and have the right to elect non-voting delegates to Congress, a quirk in US voting laws means they can't elect the president. That leaves them as onlookers to the larger contest underway between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In the Northern Marianas, KUAM News journalist Thomas Manglona told ABC's Pacific Beat that many people on the islands believe they should be able to vote for the US president. \"Every election cycle there are those conversations about us being able to serve in the military but not being able to vote for the commander-in-chief who sends our family into war,\" he said. Voters in Guam can indicate their preferred presidential candidate on the ballot, but this doesn't count towards the result. The Democratic candidate for Guam's delegate to Congress, Ginger Cruz, said the island was watching the election closely, even if it didn't vote in the main contest. \"We're very engaged in politics here, it's kind of like our Super Bowl,\" Ms Cruz said. By Tessa Flemming  JD Vance has made his last attempt to get supporters out to vote. He's used his dog Atlas's first birthday to encourage people to cast a ballot for himself and Trump. By Tessa Flemming  In Tijuana, Mexico, migrants lined up hours before their 5 am appointments to legally enter the United States using an online phone app that the Biden administration introduced in January 2023 to discourage illegal border crossings. More than 852,000 migrants have entered the US on the CBP One app, whose future hangs on the outcome of US presidential elections. Donald Trump has strongly criticized CBP One, a less-publicised piece of an immigration platform that includes plans for mass deportations. Kamala Harris has offered few specifics on immigration but is expected to largely continue Biden administration policies, including severe restrictions on seeking asylum. Cuban Graviel Escobar, 22, was one of those lining up who plans to live in New York, \"It's about economic necessity,\" he said. Reporting with AP  By Tessa Flemming  As of 9am ET, a few more states have opened polls, including: By Tessa Flemming  We heard from Kamala Harris, now we're hearing from Barack Obama.  He's posted a short video ahead of election day, saying \"just a handful of votes\" could decide the election. By Jessica Riga We're only hours into voting, but let's look forward for a minute to when counting begins. Early vote counts in US battleground states may not be a good indicator of whether Trump or Harris will win. In the 2020 election, some states showed a \"red mirage,\" in which Trump was leading on election night, before a \"blue shift\" saw Democrat Joe Biden overtake him as mail-in ballots favored by more Democratic voters were counted. Experts had accurately predicted it would happen but Trump still used the shift to amplify his false claims that the election was stolen. It could happen again this week, especially in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The opposite – a \"blue mirage\" apparently showing a strong result for Harris only for a \"red shift\" to reverse the trend — could also happen this week, especially in North Carolina and Georgia. Trump's campaign team has said he plans to declare victory when his team believes he has crossed the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the election. That could be premature, depending on how many votes have yet to be counted and where they come from. Reporting with Reuters By Tessa Flemming  As of 8.30am ET, Arkansas is the only new poll to open.

The hype songs and their basslines pump through the sound system and rattle the press pen. There's merchandise, long lines and a lot of waiting around. It's not always easy for foreign press to get media accreditation for these rallies, but in this last run-up to the election in Green Bay, Wisconsin, I was in the media pack as Donald Trump donned a high-vis vest and took to the stage. This is just one event on his intense rally schedule heading into tomorrow's vote. But from my vantage point, I could see in much detail the show that is Donald Trump. The stadium is packed with Trump supporters, many donning red MAGA hats and various other Trump paraphernalia. But if you look closely in the sea of people, you can start to get a feel for just how carefully orchestrated these rallies really are. Like the Team Trump campaign staffers who swarm the event during the set-up. One of their key roles is trying to get the media in the right spot or, perhaps more importantly, not having them in the wrong place. The crowd is also dotted with various levels of security. This guard was wearing a staff lanyard and appeared to be private security — as opposed to law enforcement officers, who were in uniforms. There are also the local staff and volunteers. When the Trump circus comes to town, the local or state level campaign resources are pushed to where the action is. Sometimes they're given less than 24 hours' notice as plans rapidly change, especially so late in the race. These team members were ushering crowds earlier in the day. This is the VIP section. NFL and Green Bay Packers legend Brett Favre was here campaigning for Trump. The former president quipped on stage that he was upset that Favre had received bigger applause from the local crowd. Surrounding the stage is Trump's close protection unit. It's estimated that as many as 80 Secret Service staff members are assigned to the former president. This was the rally in Green Bay that happened just after Donald Trump's garbage truck stunt. In his address he explained he got to the arena and asked his staff, \"Where's my jacket? I want to get out of this thing.\" They told him, \"It would be unbelievable if you could wear it on stage,\" wanting the performance to continue. Trump initially said \"no way\", but then one quick-thinking staffer told him, \"You know it actually makes you look thinner.\" Trump says: \"And they got me.\" Here he is on stage, looking nothing other than more orange. This is a chart showing US-Mexico border crossings during both Trump and Joe Biden's time in office. It's the same chart he turned to look at a split second before a bullet flew past his head and grazed his ear in Butler, Pennsylvania, back in July. He says it saved his life and now it's his favourite chart. Media aren't allowed to roam around the event. The arena doors open early in the day for staff, crew and law enforcement, and media are allowed in for an hour to set up their equipment, before they're kicked out until a few hours before the rally starts. During that time security agencies sweep the gear that's set up here on the riser to make sure there are no risks. The first speeches started around 4pm. Media are locked in this pen at that point until the rally is over. This is Tera Dahl. She's with right-wing American media organisation Real Voices for America. There was a reserved spot for this crew at the front of the media riser.

(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) The United States is approaching a milestone moment, inching towards a major political crossroads. Will Kamala Harris, America's first female vice-president, now become the first woman to hold the title of US President and Commander-in-Chief?  Amid the fevered fray of US politics during months of campaigning, this question about whether a woman, especially one of African-Asian descent, can hold the highest political office in the world's most powerful democracy has been asked time and again.  Yet in parts of the world that draw far less attention the question has already been answered with an emphatic \"yes\". From Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who was the first woman elected as a head of state anywhere in the world when she became prime minister of what is now Sri Lanka in 1960, to Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office as president on October 1 this year after running against another female candidate, women have reached the highest political office for decades. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Sri Lanka's Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the world's first female prime minister. (Supplied) Australians don't have to look far to see where women have surmounted obstacles of cultural, social, political and economic norms to rise to power. Julia Gillard faced substantial backlash and negative commentary focused largely on her gender after becoming Australia's first female prime minister in 2010.   As well as one female PM, Australia has appointed two female governors-general: Dame Quentin Bryce, who was in office from 2008-2014, and Sam Mostyn, who took office in July.  Just across the Tasman, New Zealand has already had three female prime ministers - Jenny Shipley, Helen Clark and Jacinda Adern.  Female leaders have had impact across Asia, too, from Myanmar and the Philippines to Thailand, South Korea and more. In Europe and the UK, female leaders from Britain's Margaret Thatcher who rose to power in 1979 to Italy's current leader Giorgia Meloni elected in 2022, have been plentiful compared with many other parts of the world. Yet the fact remains that women are vastly outnumbered by men in political leadership.  Only 31 per cent of United Nations' member states have ever had a female leader. That's 60 countries out of 193.  Today's figures are even lower: women serve as the head of government in just 13 of 193 UN member states, according to the Pew Research Centre. But progress continues to be made, even in those regions where women's place in power is radically redefining generations of gender role-modelling and where added barriers such as poverty and lack of education remain entrenched. Here is a snapshot of some areas where woman are having a political impact. A little more than a week ago the prime minister of Samoa, Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa, welcomed leaders of the Commonwealth including King Charles III and Queen Camilla for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. King Charles met with Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa last month. (Reuters: Aaron Chown) In the Pacific, female leadership is the lowest of anywhere in the world. Only one other woman has been head of state of a Pacific nation: Hilda Heine, the former president of the Marshall Islands. In a political career spanning more than 30 years, Fiamē's rise to become the top politician in her nation has not been without struggle. On many occasions her status as a woman was held against her: as deputy PM in 2016 she was criticised by male colleagues who questioned her authority on matters concerning children because she was not a mother.  \"I don't think there's any other stronger power than the power of a love of a parent for their child. And I may not have children but I know that because I had parents,\" she responded, before shutting down the questioning.  \"We're here as ministers of government, and it's our business to determine the policies … so let's keep the conversation where it should be.\"  So how did Fiamē overcome scepticism about her gender and win over her nation? Fiamē resigned as deputy PM in 2020 and headed a new political party so she could run against Samoa's longest-serving prime minister, Tuila'epa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi, in the hotly-contested 2021 general election. A battle over the official election results followed, but Fiamē's right to rule was laid to rest after a Court of Appeal decision. In Latin America, the right to vote was granted to women in Equador in 1929, but women Paraguay waited until 1961. More recently the region has experienced a powerful new era for women in politics.   Mexico's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who has been in office barely a month, moved into politics after a career as a climate scientist and joint winner of a Nobel Prize in 2007 as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. She has a huge majority — dominating both chambers of the national congress — but an equally giant task ahead with violence and organised crime at the top of her to-do list.  Surpassing even Sheinbaum's achievement, the high-water mark of female leadership in Latin American was perhaps a period of 58 days in 2014 when four female heads of state were in office at the same time in Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica and Brazil. Michelle Bachelet — who lived in Sydney during her 20s when her family fled persecution and the death of her father at the hands of military dictator Augusto Pinochet — had already been the first female president of Chile for eight years in 2014. Former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, who was tortured by a dictator and forced to flee her country, has taken over from Zeid Raad Al Hussein as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. By the time her second term ended Bachelet was keeping company with first-time women leaders including Brazil's Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016) and Costa Rica's Laura Chincilla (2010-2014). Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was Argentina's second-ever female president from 2007 to 2015, and the first to be directly elected.  It was the culmination of a rising tide of leadership among female Latina politicians that began in the mid-2000s and was viewed as a sign of progress against a particular brand of patriarchy in the region known as \"machismo\".   Just like Samoa's Fiamē who faced gender-based attacks, Brazil's Roussef (who ultimately lost office in 2016 following corruption scandals) was also the target of misogynistic attacks from opposition figure Jair Bolsonaro who went on to become president from 2019-2023. Former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, pictured in 2020, was impeached in 2016.\n\n  (Reuters: Charles Platiau) The status of women and girls in the region has traditionally been relegated to the sphere of the home or low-paying work and women's reproductive health rights come up against staunchly held religious beliefs of the predominantly Catholic populace.   But the growing influence of women in politics is also influencing these beliefs. Argentina, Colombia, Guyana and Uruguay have all expanded abortion rights and in 2023 Mexico decriminalised the termination of pregnancy. Advances are not being made everywhere. Peru's Dina Boluarte was Vice-President when she became the first woman to take over as president after Pedro Castillo was removed from office by Congress in December 2022. Boluarte's time in office has failed to curb concerns about corruption, poor economic performance and condemnation for a crackdown on protesters in which 49 people were killed. Polls have put Boluarte's approval rating this year at between 5-10 per cent as she clings on to power. South Asia underwent a tectonic reshaping when Britain's imperial grasp on the region was shaken off by independence movements in Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan after World War II. The reverberations of those shifts sowed opportunities for change and discord, both of which underlined the rise of female leaders in the region. Just six years after Bandaranaike, the first woman elected as a head of state anywhere in the world became the prime minister of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1960, the country's far more populous neighbour, India, appointed its first female prime minister, Indira Gandhi, in 1966. Indira Gandhi in 1977. (Dutch National Archives) Steeped in political pedigree — Gandhi's husband was a politician, her father Jawaharlal Nehru was India's first prime minister, and her son Rajiv a future Indian PM — Indira Gandhi served three terms as India's prime minister before being assassinated in 1984. Rajiv's Italian-born widow, Sonia, has remained an influential figure in Indian politics. A similar story emerged in Pakistan, India's western neighbour, where themes of family power saw Benazir Bhutto follow her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, into politics. She became the first female leader of a Muslim-majority nation in 1988.  The family's political successes were also marked by violence. Bhutto's father was executed under martial law and Bhutto herself, twice exiled, was assassinated in 2007 when her motorcade was attacked.  In more recent times, Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, served as both Sri Lanka's prime minister and in 1994 became the nation's first female president. Kumaratunga served two six-year terms ending in 2005. India's female president Droupadi Murmu is the first tribal Indian to hold the largely ceremonial office after winning the vote of state and federal lawmakers in 2022. \"A daughter of India hailing from a tribal community born in a remote part of eastern India has been elected our President!\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on social media. Kamala Harris, the granddaughter of a villager from southern India, is drawing just as much excitement from the state of Tamil Nadu where she's been proclaimed a \"daughter of the land\" despite never visiting Thulasendrapuram. \"If we truly seek a peaceful and just world, we must systemically enhance women's access to, and participation in, decision-making processes.\"   A woman of her word, Nobel laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf overturned decades of war, corruption and devastation in Liberia when she was inaugurated in 2006 as the first woman to be elected as head of state of any country in Africa. She led the country until 2018 through 2014's deadly Ebola outbreak which killed almost 5,000 people.  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, pictured in 2018, was the first female head of state in Africa. (Reuters: Thierry Gouegnon) Africa, a continent where life expectancy, governance, income and education fill the bottom tiers of global rankings, is the region where an \"iron lady\" has carved a path for others to follow. Among them, Samia Suluhu Hassan, Tanzania's first female president since 2021, and Sahle-Work Zewde, who was Ethiopia's first female president from 2018 to 2024. After smashing the \"glass ceiling\", where to next?  While there is a far from even worldwide distribution of power between the genders, female political leaders have influenced the smallest of nations in the Pacific to the corridors of power in Washington DC.   And while voter polls in the US election suggest the outcome remains on a knife edge, a recent survey of 2,000 young voters in key battleground states found more than 80 per cent believe a woman could be an effective president and strong leader and 68 per cent agreed the US was ready for a female leader.  Back in 1937, a similar question found only 33 per cent believed a woman could lead America.  Whether the time has indeed come for the United States to elect a female leader is yet to be decided. As voting officially begins across the country, the world does not have to wait long to find out.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Patricia Karvelas Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Argentina Brazil Chile Costa Rica Ethiopia Foreign Affairs India Liberia Marshall Islands Mexico Pakistan Samoa Sri Lanka Tanzania, United Republic Of US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Here's how it works: The USA has a decentralised election system, with thousands of local county governments tabulating and reporting results.  This is very different to Australia’s independent electoral commission. ABC News relies on the Associated Press (AP) for all vote count data and race calls.  As a general rule, the ABC does not project winners in foreign elections. AP has been compiling and tabulating election results since 1848.  This election, AP will have a network of about 4,000 reporters across the country collecting results data, plus nearly 1,000 reporters in its vote entry centre. The mass decentralisation in elections administration means calling the winners in US races requires significant local expertise in counting procedures, voting history, and exit polling. The ABC is using calls from AP as it has a track record of accuracy and caution in calling elections.

At the Kamala Harris support party, US citizens said they were excited at the prospect of a first female president. Trump supporters down the road played bar games and eagerly watched television coverage.   Anthony Roy cast his first ever vote in the US election, and now, watching on from a Sydney pub, he is eagerly awaiting the results from the other side of the world.

(AP: Alex Brandon) Donald Trump has been elected president of the United States after flipping multiple swing states to secure the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. Election day was a relatively smooth affair for voters, despite bomb threats, false claims of a fake Melania at a Florida voting centre and the spreading of misinformation on social media. Not long after the last poll closed, it became clear Trump was leading in all of the widely watched swing states and had a clear path to victory. He will become the second person in American history to serve non-consecutive terms as president, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th Century. In a victory speech to supporters in Florida, Trump claimed that America will be \"bigger, better, bolder\" in his second term in the White House and promised to \"fight for you, for your family, and your future\". \"We have been through so much together and today you showed up and in record numbers to deliver a victory like probably no other, this is something special,\" he said. \"We are going to pay you back, we are going to do the best job, we are going to turn it around and it will be turned around fast.\" From a clear result in an election many pundits thought would be too close to call, to Republicans retaking the Senate and a grim mood at Harris headquarters, these were the key moments from election day. In an address to supporters gathered at an election watch party in West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning (local time), Trump claimed he had won the popular vote. It prompted loud chants of \"USA, USA, USA\" from those inside the room. The former president said the election result was \"a political victory that our country has never seen before\". Donald Trump did a little dance as he claimed victory.  (Reuters: Carlos Barria) \"I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honour of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,\" he said. He went on to thank his wife Melania, his children and his vice president JD Vance for their efforts during the campaign, noting that he had taken a little heat at the beginning for his choice of running mate. \"We're going to have a great four years and turn our country around and make it something very special,\" he said. Hours before his address, two battleground states offered early signs of who would ultimately claim victory in the race: Georgia and North Carolina. Both states are famous for relatively quick counts, and both were soon called for Trump. It left Kamala Harris's victory dependent on sweeping Wisconsin, Michigan and the real prize, Pennsylvania. The states are regarded as the \"blue wall\", and once were reliable Democratic strongholds, but they've been known to crumble in favour of Republicans now and then. That turned out to be the case for Trump, who claimed Pennsylvania just as he strolled on to the Florida stage to the roar of supporters. The state of Wisconsin ultimately pushed him beyond the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris held her election party at her alma mater Howard University in Washington DC. It started out as a joyous dance party, as young people said they were excited to see the election of the first woman of colour to the White House. Harris always had her work cut out for her in this race. Kamala Harris supporters react as states are called for Donald Trump.  (Reuters: Daniel Cole) She was catapulted to the top of the presidential ticket in July when her boss, President Joe Biden stepped aside due to concerns about his mental acuity. For a shot at victory, everything had to go right in an achingly tight race. But as soon as polls closed, it quickly became apparent it wouldn't go her way. When the crucial swing state of Georgia was called for Trump by CNN, witnesses say the mood at Harris's part in DC became very grim indeed. As the party emptied out, Harris's campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon sent an email to staffers, in which she urged them to \"get some sleep\". \"As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race,\" she wrote. \"This is what we've been built for, so let's finish up what we have in front of us tonight, get some sleep and get ready to close out strong tomorrow.\" People left Kamala Harris's election night rally when results came in. (Reuters: Craig Hudson) It's expected we won't hear from the vice-president until tomorrow. The gender divide among voters was a key focus this election, with uncertainty about how this split would play out on polling day and what it would mean for each candidate. Early surveys suggest there's been an increase in female voters taking part in the 2024 election compared to 2020.  (AP: Kareem Elgazzar) Early surveys indicated there was a slight increase in the number of American women who cast ballots on November 5. Data from AP's VoteCast survey shows 54 per cent of voters are women in 2024, up from 53 per cent in 2020. Republicans were aware coming into election day that female voters could make or break Trump's fortunes, with one of his closest advisers, Stephen Miller, going so far as to urge men to get to the polls to counteract the surge. A key concern was how women would vote in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs Wade in 2022, which ended the constitutional right to abortion and sent the issue back to the states. Trump's appointment of three conservative justices to the court during his presidency paved the way for the ruling, which resulted in more than 20 states introducing bans or restrictions on abortion. After Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, the number of women who named abortion as their top election issue increased, according to New York Times/Siena polls. Women dance on their way to a polling station in Florida.  (Reuters: Octavio Jones) The Vice-President and her team campaigned heavily on the issue, insisting Trump can't be trusted on reproductive access. But the much-discussed \"gender chasm\" didn't appear to work in Harris' favour. That's despite the Democratic presidential candidate clearly dominating among younger voters, according to exit polls. The Harris campaign hoped women would be galvanised by the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022 to vote for her.  (AP: Chris Pizzello) ABC America found that while young men under 30 were evenly split between Harris and Trump, the Democrat held a 26-point lead with women in the same age group. It came as polls found a higher share of younger voters took part in this election. AP's VoteCast survey found 16 per cent of voters were 18-29-year-olds. In 2020 they made up 13 per cent of voters. Surveys suggest a surge in Gen Z voters showing up to vote in this election.  (Reuters: Kevin Mohatt) Surveys have previously found the younger age group are irregular voters and are less connected to either party. While the focus for many Americans was on the outcome of the presidential race, the battles for the US House of Representatives and the Senate are arguably even more crucial. The House and Senate races will determine whether America's next president will face partisan gridlock. (Reuters: Leah Millis) Republicans secured control of the Senate early on election night, retaking the chamber for the first time in four years. But control of the House of Representatives remains in doubt, with The Associated Press reporting dozens of races are yet to be called. It could be hours before an outcome is finalised, with tight contests taking place across the country. If the Republicans win both chambers of congress it will pave the way for Trump's agenda to be enacted in full. While the voting process was largely calm on November 5, it belied a suffocating sense of anxiety among voters who were awaiting the outcome of a razor's-edge election race. On the ground, voters took part in their election day rituals, wiling away the time by exercising, catching up with friends or gathering for democracy parties. But social media platforms quickly became a hotbed of conspiracy theories and misinformation ranging from mild claims about a fake Melania Trump to more dangerous allegations of voter fraud and election rigging in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump and his wife Melania cast their ballots in Palm Beach, Florida.  (Reuters: Brian Snyder) When Trump showed up to a Florida precinct to cast his vote early on November 5, social media users were convinced the woman photographed by his side was not his wife Melania but a body double. People honed in on her decision to wear sunglasses indoors, missing rings and her choice of dress as signs the former first lady had been replaced by a look-a-like. There is no evidence to suggest Melania is using a body double but it was not the only sign of things going awry on election day. Bomb threats across precincts in four states caused disruptions as some were forced to temporarily close. The FBI said many of the threat claims \"appear to originate from Russian email domains\" and \"none of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far\". Georgia's Republican secretary of state was one of many officials who spoke out against the threats. A supporter of Donald Trump celebrated at his rally at the Palm Beach County Convention Center. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) Meanwhile, one of the common threads that took hold early in the day was allegations of voter fraud and election rigging in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state for both parties. Thousands of accounts on social media platform X shared a video as evidence of the \"fraud\", however the ABC Verify team has found the footage is old and a widely debunked video of election workers in Arizona that was filmed in 2022 ahead of the US mid-terms. Reuters has previously reported that what the video actually shows is a \"routine procedure to install memory cards into voter machines\".

(Reuters: Nathan Howard) Voting in the US presidential election is in full swing, with large queues reported at many polling booths across the country. In the capital, Washington DC, temporary barriers are being constructed around key buildings in case large crowds take to the streets if a winner is declared. Polling has closed in some parts of the country's east, with early results expected after that. The United States capital is bracing for a rush of people onto its streets on Tuesday evening, with polling booths in some states beginning to close before early results start to trickle in.  Polls have closed in parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, Virginia, and the crucial swing state of Georgia, as this marathon election campaign finally draws to a close.  In Washington DC, security around the White House and Capitol building has been increased, with physical fortifications in place. In the safe Democrat district, voters and organisers say they're excited for a possible Kamala Harris win, but nervous about what that could mean for their city. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  The insurrection on January 6, 2021 — the escalation of Donald Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 presidential election loss — is still very much in the city's consciousness. A CNN exit poll released 5pm Tuesday local time (9am Wednesday, AEDT), showed the majority of Americans were \"dissatisfied\" or \"angry\" with the way the country was being run. The exit poll was a survey of voters, who cast their ballot either on the day or before it, and is designed to reflect the mood of the electorate before the actual results arrive.  Workers cover the windows of a pharmacy near the White House with wood this week. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) After voting at the Martin Luther King Jnr Memorial Library polling station in Washington DC on Tuesday new mother Kate Hall said she hoped \"the country makes the right decision\". She said Harris \"feels like someone who can guide our country towards prosperity and a champion of women's rights\". \"And then there's someone who tried to overthrow democracy, so it's very scary,\" Ms Hall said.  Kate Hall casts her vote in Washington DC, and hopes the Democrats' candidate wins. (ABC News: Emily Clark) \"If you walk around downtown you can see some buildings have already pre-emptively barricaded and put wood panelling up to protect their windows because they fear some kind of insurrection. \"As a lifelong supporter of democracy, it's very scary to think this can happen in our country if one candidate doesn't win the majority of votes or in the electoral college, that people might try to overthrow democracy.\" The block surrounding the library was cleared for about an hour on Tuesday as a police operation was underway. The world's press had gathered at the polling station and were pushed back beyond police cordons after a suspicious package was found, but it was later assessed by police explosives experts to pose no threat. Will Donald Trump make an extraordinary political comeback, four years after he was voted out of the White House? Or will Kamala Harris's remarkably short campaign deliver her victory? Here are five things to watch out for as the day unfolds. In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said reported bomb threats at polling stations were possibly \"of Russian origin\". All were deemed non-credible, and authorities were investigating, he said. Meanwhile, a man was arrested in upstate New York after threatening to burn down a polling place about 6:30am Tuesday, local time. On Monday evening, Larry Krasner, the Pennsylvania district attorney, warned people not to \"f*** around\" with the election. \"We do have the cuffs, we do have the jail cells,\" he said. A police officer keeps watch near the Martin Luther King Jnr Memorial Library in Washington DC on Tuesday. (ABC News: Emily Clark) On Tuesday, Harris used a radio interview broadcast in the battleground state of Georgia to encourage people to vote, saying her and Trump had \"different visions of the future of our nation\". Trump, meanwhile, cast his vote at Florida's Mandel Recreation Centre on Tuesday, and told reporters he felt \"very confident\" of victory. \"It looks like Republicans have shown up in force,\" he said. Several states have kept early voting options that were introduced for the 2020 election in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning Tuesday arrived with more than 82 million Americans having already cast their vote, according to Associated Press. Organisers had hoped that would help reduce lines today.Across the country, election day appears to be unfolding largely smoothly; there have been some reports of flooding affecting a polling station in Missouri, ballot printing errors and technical problems are causing some delays.Most of the hiccups occurring by midday (local time) were \"largely expected routine and planned-for events,\" said Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in a press briefing. People cast their ballots in Jeannette, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) In swing-state Pennsylvania, early reports that Republican poll watchers were not allowed into some polling sites were soon resolved. A software malfunction was affecting ballot scanning machines in the state's Cambria County, but no one was being turned away from the polls and all ballots would be counted, county and state officials said. Pennsylvania will arguably be the most-watched state this evening as results start to be counted. Both Harris and Trump blitzed the state yesterday as they made their final bids for its 19 electoral college votes and ultimately, the presidency. Joe Kohosek was among the voters at the Jeannette Italian Club. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) In Pennsylvania's so-called \"rust belt\", voters were trickling into a polling station in the town of Jeannette, near Pittsburgh, on Tuesday. The county it's in, Westmoreland, voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, and local Joe Kohosek is hoping the former president turns the whole state red this time. Like many of the Trump supporters in this part of the US, he says he hasn't \"liked where the country's been going for a long time\". \"With him, it got better for those four years that he was in there,\" Joe said, after casting his ballot at the Jeannette Italian Club. \"He's not a politician, he's a businessman, and he wanted to run the country like a business. \"That's how he was running it, and it was working good. No wars.\" Rhonda Kohl, who was also casting her vote in Jeannette, said she was worried about which way Pennsylvania would vote. \"Trump is a buffoon, liar, felon,\" she said. \"My husband and I often talk about leaving if he gets elected again, but nobody wants senior citizens. We've talked about Canada, but they don't want us.\" Pennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\", which helped Joe Biden win the White House in 2020. But if Trump manages to flip it, he's highly likely to become president. \"My biggest concern is the economy,\" Rhonda said. \"It's going to be for rich people, and rich people only.\" Rhonda Kohl is worried that Pennsylvania may flip at this election. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Jeannette resident Jen Galbraith is so keen to see Trump back in office, she's decided to vote in her first presidential election. Asked why, she instantly cites the most commonly given reason: \"The economy.\" \"Especially for the middle class, he was just better all round,\" she said. \"Groceries, gas, you name it, all of our utilities have gone up. It's just insane, the price increases over the past few years.\" Jen Galbraith is a first-time voter this election. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Harris graduated Howard University in Washington DC's north in 1986, but tonight she will return for her election night event as she learns how many Americans voted to make her the first woman to win the presidency. Preparations for that event have been happening for several days with surrounding streets closed and barricades around the campus. Workers erect security fencing near the White House this week. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) At the close by Columbia Heights Community Centre, Keith Holder cast his vote this morning and said the energy at Howard tonight was \"going to be awesome\". \"I think she's very smart, I love the rallies that she's doing. Not only for the singers but [encouraging] young people 18 and up to get out and vote, I think that's very positive,\" he said.  \"The young people in my family ... because she did that rally in Atlanta with the rappers. They have never been represented like they've been represented with her.\" Mr Holder said he encouraged his nephews and nieces to vote because \"we didn't have rights back then, but now we do so even if the weather is bad, I get out and vote\". \"I see a lot of people to have a handicap to come out and vote so that makes me proud too. Mr Holder said he thinks people will be out on the streets around Howard: \"everyone is going to come out, either way.\" Keith Holder has been encouraging his relatives to vote. (ABC News: Emily Clark) Of course, it could be days until there is a result, with the 2020 election taking more than three days to be called for President Biden. The last polls will close by 4pm AEDT. Also in Columbia Heights, campaign organiser for a local democratic reform initiative on the ballot Miguel Trindade Deramo said the people he speaks to are \"laser focused on the presidential election\". \"We're all expecting three or four days of anxiety so there's lots of social planning going on,\" he said. \"Everyone's talking about, what things are you doing for the next four days socially with your friends to make sure that you're just dispersing your anxiety and taking a walk outside and playing with a puppy, having a dinner party and doing things that are just going to keep you grounded and not biting your nails and stress eating, and scrolling on social media.\" Miguel Trindade Deramo makes a point to a voter in Washington DC on Tuesday. (ABC News: Emily Clark) On the last weekend before election day, Trump continued to claim without evidence the election was being rigged against him and said a presidential winner should be declared on election night, before all the ballots are counted.Vice-President Harris urged voters not to fall for Trump's tactic of casting doubt on elections. The Democratic nominee told supporters at a weekend rally in Michigan that the tactic was intended to suggest to people \"that if they vote, their vote won't matter\". Instead, she urged people who had already cast ballots to encourage their friends to do the same.

You can follow the latest from the US election in today's US election blog. Donald Trump has defeated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris in key battleground states and the popular vote, telling supporters America will be \"bigger, better, bolder\" in his second term in the White House. Follow live. Look back on our blog.  By Georgie Hewson It is a new day so we are moving over to another blog where we will continue to update readers of the wash-up of the US election results. We are yet to hear from Kamala Harris and there are many more reactions to come. Follow today's US live politics blog here: By Georgie Hewson President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received a record of over 80 million votes to win the White House in 2020. They beat Donald Trump and Mike Pence, who received over 74 million votes. This year so far, Harris and Walz have received only 66 million. Trump and Vance have received over 71 million votes as of Wednesday morning, US time. In 2020, Biden and Harris won the majority of the Electoral College with 306 votes. This year, Trump has won 277 electoral votes so far, with 37 votes still up for grabs. Reporting with AP By Georgie Hewson Who is expected to win the house of representatives. And when will we know this? - Noah Reuters reports that Republicans won control of the US Senate with victories in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia on Wednesday, ensuring Donald Trump's party will control at least one chamber of Congress next year. But, the House is still up for grabs.  Republicans were set to hold a majority of at least 52-48 in the US Senate and had added three seats to their 220-212 House of Representatives majority, though with 51 of the 435 races yet uncalled, final control of the lower chamber is still unclear. If Republicans ultimately prevail in the House, they would be in a position to dictate the agenda in Washington, helping Trump deliver on his promise to slash taxes and restrict immigration, for at least the next two years until the 2026 midterm elections. But with at least 200 seats safe for each party, the winning side will likely end up with a narrow majority that could make governing difficult. That has been evident in the past two years as Republican infighting has led to failed votes and leadership turmoil and undercut the party's efforts to cut spending and tighten immigration. Tight races in the the heavily democratic states of New York and California could determine House control, and California typically takes several days to count its ballots. Reporting with Reuters By Georgie Hewson What happens with Trumps charges against him now? Can he still stand trial?  - Bonnie Now that Trump has been elected, we can expect to hear the last of both of his federal cases. Prior to his re-election, reports indicated the former president planned to appoint loyal officials to the Department of Justice. If that happens, they could have both the federal election interference case and the appeal in the federal documents case dropped. Aside from that, there's also the potential that Trump simply pardons himself. The US Constitution also authorises the sitting president to grant pardons for federal crimes. Trump's attorneys have said they would try and postpone the Georgia trial until after he leaves office because of the difficulty of having him appear in court every day while commander in chief. But even if Trump can't have the state charges thrown out, the recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity could make them dead in the water too. Read more about all of those cases here: By Georgie Hewson Hi, my name is Georgie Hewson and I will be taking over the blog from Liana this morning. Stay with us as we bring you the reactions from Donald Trump's win of the US presidential election. By Liana Walker Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. The results include firsts for the abortion landscape, which underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states. Reporting by AP By Liana Walker He only gets one term right?? - Steph Hey Steph! The US constitution says presidents are only permitted to serve two elected terms — or eight years. The exact relevant wording in the 22nd amendment is: No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. So the key word here is elected.  Hypothetically, there are a few ways someone could become president without being elected — for example, if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office and a vice president becomes president, that's technically not by election (although it's not really relevant for Trump.) There is also an unusual circumstance where a president can be \"chosen\" by a house of representatives if there is no majority vote from the electoral college —again not particularly relevant for this election. By Liana Walker The price of bitcoin hashit a new high as investors bet that Trump's victory will be a boon for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin jumped nearly 8 per cent in early trading, climbing above $US75,000 ($114,000) and smashing its previous record set in March. Other cryptocurrencies also soared, including ether, the world's second most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, which rallied 8 per cent.  Another token, dogecoin, rocketed as much as 18 per cent. It's the favorite cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, one of Trump's most prominent supporters.  Trump was previously a crypto skeptic but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies ahead of the election. Reporting with AP  By Liana Walker While we know there are still four states yet to be declared, there is actually a fifth one that we only half know — sort of. Maine splits its electoral votes. It awards two electoral votes to the winner of the statewide vote, as well as one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district. Maine votes reliably Democratic in statewide elections, but Republicans are competitive in the more conservative 2nd Congressional District.  Trump won the district and its electoral vote for the third consecutive election, while Harris picked up Maine's remaining three electoral votes by winning statewide and the 1st Congressional District. We are still waiting on a final result for them. By the way, Nebraska also splits their votes, but we already have a result for them. By Liana Walker Americans are voting for lots other positions today besides the President, are there other races that are worth watching?\neg Governor,Senate etc? - Catherine  Hey Catherine! You're spot on — Americans are also voting for everything from their local governor to the local sheriff and even the tax collectors. Certainly one to watch will be the some of the states' district attorneys and what flow on effects that may have. For example, we know George Gascón, who was the district attorney in Los Angeles has lost his place to Nathan Hochman. You might recognise Gascón's name most recently from his involvement in the Menendez brothers' case where he recently recommended them from resentencing.  It's a wait and see what happens with that case now. He was known in the state as the godfather of progressive prosecutors. That's just one example of a different race to watch. Casey Briggs' recently broke down some of the others: By Liana Walker Is there any information about the voter turnout in this election compared to 2016 and 2020?  - Skye Hey Skye! While it's too early to know the exact number for this election we do have the figures for the last two!  According to data collected by the UC Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project: What we also know is how many people voted early this year — as AP reports that number is 84,236,221.  By Liana Walker Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Trump in a post on the social platform X and included a picture of the two of them in the White House during the President-elect's first term. Trump as president called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest\" and attacked Canada's vital trade. He threatened tariffs on cars and imposed them on steel. The unprecedented tone against one of Washington's closest allies left a bitter taste, and most Canadians were relieved that Trump was defeated in 2020. Reporting with AP By Liana Walker The team at Story Lab have broken down how Donald Trump flipped the US election map and won a return to the White House. This piece shows his path to victory via a handy map: By Louise Miolin Harris emphasised young voters in her campaign, repeatedly shouting out Gen Z at rallies. But it wasn't enough to land her a victory. Anil Cacodar is the Chair of the Harvard University Public Opinion Project, America's biggest poll on the political opinions of young Americans. He told Stephanie Smail on ABC's PM while both parties tapped into the youth vote, Trump's success was in his \"ability to turn out young men who have been disengaged in prior elections.\" He said while both young men and young women cared about the economy, young women were more likely to vote for Harris because of concerns over reproductive rights. Young men, he said, might have turned out for Trump because they believe he promises economic change. Young voters are often considered progressive, but Cacodar said there are shifts towards conservatism happening. \"You're actually seeing that the 18 to 24 year old cohort is more conservative than the 25 to 29 year old cohort.\" By Louise Miolin As the Democrats stared down losing the White House, Democratic strategist Na'ilah Amura spoke to Stephanie Smail on ABC's PM. \"We thought we had a winning strategy and clearly we didn't just fall short, but we fell short in ways that we were not expecting to,\" she said. Ms Amaru said the loss was not due to personal short fallings of Harris, but rather broader Democratic strategy issues. \"I think that she performed as best as she could given the circumstances – remember, this feels like years ago, but she was just named as our as our primary presidential candidate less than four months ago,\" she said. Ms Amura said Harris had to \"walk a delicate tightrope\" to define herself as a candidate without differentiating herself too much from Joe Biden while she remained his vice president. She said ultimately, the Republicans took advantage of that situation. \"The Republicans came out and they clearly said 'We do not want a continuation of Biden,' … they decided to choose something different.\" \"And in this case, in this election cycle, that something different was Donald Trump.\" By Liana Walker The Kremlin reacted cautiously on Wednesday after Donald Trump declared victory in the US presidential election, saying the US was still a hostile state and that time would tell if Trump rhetoric on ending the Ukraine war translated into reality. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the Soviet Union and the US came close to nuclear war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump had made some important statements about wanting to end the Ukraine war during his campaign, but only time would tell if they lead to action. \"Let us not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state\" (in Ukraine),\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov said he was not aware of any plans by President Vladimir Putin to congratulate Trump on his victory and that relations with Washington were at an historic low. Reporting with Reuters By Liana Walker The Associated Press are now reviewing what are known as \"late earlies\" or mail ballots that arrived or were dropped off at a polling place on Election Day or the weekend prior. The AP team will review these before making a call on Arizona.  By Liana Walker British police arrested two men after environmental activists sprayed orange paint on a section of the US embassy building in south London on Wednesday to protest against Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. Two campaigners from Just Stop Oil sprayed the embassy's compound wall with orange paint, a video posted by the group on X showed. \"Trump's win puts the lives of ordinary people at risk, everywhere,\" Just Stop Oil said. London's Metropolitan Police arrested two men, aged 25 and 72, on suspicion of criminal damage, the force said. Reporting with Reuters By Liana Walker US elections analyst Casey Briggs says the south of Texas near the border with Mexico has been pushing further to the right over time. By Liana Walker Any data on how Jill Stein is going yet? - Frank A few of you have been asking about the Green Party's candidate Jill Stein. So far she hasn't managed to pick up any votes from the electoral college. The result is unsurprising, as third-party candidates have historically struggled to break through in America's two-party preferred system.

No. Under the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, which was ratified in 1951, Trump is barred from seeking the presidency for a third time.

(AP: Jacquelyn Martin) Safe states have been called for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, while Trump has pulled ahead in multiple swing states too as counting in the US presidential election continues. The Associated Press declared Trump had won the battleground states of North Carolina and Georgia. Democratic nominee Harris needs to win the so-called \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to claim the presidency, but Trump is leading in all of them. Republican nominee Donald Trump had claimed some swing states and was leading Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all others as counting in the US presidential election extended into Wednesday morning, local time. Both candidates dominated in their traditional heartlands, and as the night went on, Trump began pulling ahead in the key battlegrounds. The Associated Press called the first of seven swing states for Trump — North Carolina — just after 3:15pm on Wednesday AEDT.  He later flipped Georgia. By 1:30am local time (5:30pm AEDT), he was within striking distance of the White House. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Many analysts predict the election will go down to the wire, and be among the closest in the country's history. In the final week of the campaign, multiple polls predicted Harris, the US vice president, was enjoying a late surge of support among voters in multiple critical swing states. The US election result hangs in the balance. Use our interactive election map to see how the swing states will decide the outcome. However, when it came to counting the actual votes, those projections did not translate. Just before 1am Wednesday local time (5pm AEDT), Harris's campaign manager strode out onto the stage at Washington DC's Howard University and told Democrats supporters their candidate would not be speaking that night. On a buoyant night for the Republicans, not only did Trump appear set for another four years in the White House, but they also looked like having a majority in the Senate after winning seats off the Democrats.

In some states, paper ballots are used while others have electronic voting machines. There are 50 American states, but there are only seven states people are paying attention to this presidential election.  Polls close at different times depending on where you are in the country, and votes are counted in distinct ways. It means that if the result is close, a final tally may not be known for several days. Most eyes are on five critical swing states yet to be called: Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. It became clear as the night progressed that Harris needed to win the so-called \"blue wall\" of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, although she trailed in all of them. A man packs away a polling booth in Kalamazzoo, Michigan on Tuesday night. (Reuters: Carlos Osorio) Under the US presidential election system, different states carry different numbers of electoral college votes, and the successful presidential candidate must reach at least 270. The first polling places closed at 6pm on Tuesday (10am Wednesday AEDT), the last ones shut at 4pm AEDT. After a frenetic week of campaigning across swing states, often hitting several in one day, both candidates decamped for a quieter day as the country voted.

(Reuters: Brian Snyder) Earlier on Tuesday, local time, Harris used a radio interview broadcast in the battleground state of Georgia to encourage people to vote, saying her and Trump had \"different visions of the future of our nation\". Trump, meanwhile, cast his vote at Florida's Mandel Recreation Centre on Tuesday, and told reporters he felt \"very confident\" of victory. \"It looks like Republicans have shown up in force,\" he said. He is holding a watch party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. Authorities were on high alert in multiple parts of the country as results came in. In the capital city, Washington DC, temporary fences provided extra security around key government buildings, including the White House.

The insurrection on January 6, 2021 — the escalation of Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 presidential election loss — is still very much in the city's consciousness. Elsewhere, people have been warned not to intimidate or attack workers or voters at polling places. On Monday evening, Larry Krasner, the Pennsylvania district attorney, warned people not to \"f*** around\" with the election. \"We do have the cuffs, we do have the jail cells,\" he said. Despite the preparations, voting took place amid relative calm around the country. In Georgia, polling was interrupted at several polling places after bomb threats.

The Republican candidate swamped his Democratic rival Kamala Harris in critical swing states. The Republicans were on track to win both chambers of congress, too, paving the way for Trump's agenda to be enacted in full. Donald Trump has won the US presidential election after a dominant performance that saw him flip multiple swing states and win the popular vote.

(Reuters: Eloisa Lopez) Russian actors have been accused of making bomb threats at multiple voting centres in the US on election day. The FBI said dozens of threats were directed at five swing states, though none were found to be credible.  Russia has denied claims of election or any other interference. Hoax bomb threats, many of which appeared to originate from Russian email domains, were directed at polling locations in the United States as Election Day voting was underway, the FBI has said. There are 50 American states, but there are only seven states people are paying attention to this presidential election.  The agency said five of seven battleground states had been targeted — Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia. \"None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,\" the FBI said in a statement, adding that election integrity was among the bureau's highest priorities. Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, blamed Russian interference for the bomb hoaxes. \"They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory,\" Mr Raffensperger told reporters. A senior official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Georgia bomb hoaxes were sent from email addresses that had been used by Russians trying to interfere in previous US elections. The threats were sent to American media and polling locations, the official said, adding that there was \"a likelihood it's Russia\". Two locations in Georgia's Fulton County were evacuated for about 30 minutes, officials said, and the county was seeking an emergency court order to extend their opening times. An FBI official said Georgia received more than two dozen threats, most in Fulton County, which encompasses much of Atlanta, a Democratic stronghold. Police in DeKalb County, Georgia — another Democratic stronghold — later responded to bomb threats at eight locations, according to a county press release.  Six of the locations were polling places and were evacuated, but no bombs were found at either site. The Russian embassy in Washington said insinuations about Russian interference were \"malicious slander\". \"We would like to emphasise that Russia has not interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including the United States,\" the embassy said in a statement.  \"As President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stressed, we respect the will of the American people.\" In Wisconsin, fake bomb threats were sent to two polling locations in the state capital of Madison, but they did not disrupt voting, said Ann Jacobs, head of the Wisconsin Elections Commission. A spokesperson for Jocelyn Benson, Michigan's Democratic secretary of state, said there had been reports of bomb threats at several polling locations, but none were credible. Adrian Fontes, the Arizona secretary of state, a Democrat who is the chief election official in the swing state, said four fake bomb threats had been delivered to polling sites in Navajo County, located in the north-eastern part of the state and which includes three Native American tribes. \"Vladimir Putin is being a prick,\" Mr Fontes told Reuters. A judge in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, extended voting hours to 9pm after a bomb threat at a vote-counting site disrupted the process. Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, said on Tuesday night multiple bomb threats had been investigated and none were found to be credible. He did not mention Russia. The phoney bomb threats mark the latest in a string of examples of alleged interference by Russia in the 2024 US election. On November 1, US intelligence officials warned Russian actors had manufactured a video that falsely depicted Haitians illegally casting ballots in Georgia.  Intelligence officials also found a separate phoney video was created that falsely accused someone associated with the Harris presidential ticket of taking a bribe from an entertainer. Polling centres in at least five states were said to be targeted by the fake bomb threats. (AP: Lindsey Wasson) US intelligence officials have also accused Russia of interfering in past US presidential elections, especially the 2016 race which Trump won against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Still, there were no major incidents reflecting foreign interference in Tuesday's presidential election, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, despite a steady stream of disinformation aimed at disrupting the vote throughout Election Day. Senior agency official Cait Conley said there was little evidence of significant disruption to election infrastructure. \"At this point, we are not currently tracking any national-level significant incidents impacting security of our election infrastructure,\" she told reporters on Tuesday evening, local time. Earlier in the day, the FBI warned Americans about three new fake videos that used its name and insignia to promote false information about the vote, the latest in a string of disinformation that officials expect will intensify, especially if uncertainty over the winner lingers past Election Day. The first video falsely claims the FBI had warned media and bloggers against publishing \"information about violence at polling stations\", claiming that doing so could spontaneously increase such incidents and that withholding such information would ensure the safety of US citizens. The second fake FBI video claims schools will be suspended until November 11 due to \"the risk of school shooting and riots\" because of the election. The third falsified FBI video claims the agency has received \"9,000 complaints about malfunctioning voting machines\", along with a claim that machines had been found to be submitting votes for select candidates. ABC NEWS Verify is staying across some of the mis- and disinformation narratives emerging online as vote counting continues.  One of the common threads taking hold early are voter fraud and election rigging in Pennsylvannia.  Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, earlier today to post an allegation of election cheating. \"A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia. Law Enforcement coming!!!,\" he wrote. The claim was debunked within minutes by Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner as having \"no factual basis\". Thousands of accounts on X have also been sharing a video as evidence of \"fraud\" in Pennsylvania, which ABC News Verify found to be footage of an old and widely debunked video of election workers in Arizona that was filmed in 2022 ahead of the US midterms.  Reuters has previously reported that what the video actually shows is a \"routine procedure to install memory cards into voter machines\". Despite this, the video has already been viewed hundreds of thousands of times and reposted extensively.

Once the official watch party for the Harris-Walz campaign opened, the university's students, staff and alumni started streaming into the venue and the program moved from rehearsals to the hype track portion of the evening. At that point there were no results to watch, so it was still very much a party. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  This is a very significant place – to Kamala Harris as a former student, but also for its long history of Black excellence. For what those gathered had hoped election night would be about. The event was held in the Yard, a grassy section of campus flanked by academic buildings. There were big screens, a stage ready for an acceptance speech and general admission areas where sororities and fraternities would break into performance.  Among the crowd of Howard University students, teachers and alumni, there was an early feeling of excitement and that the people gathered were there to witness history.  (ABC News: Emily Clark) Fraternity and sorority groups would break into performance during the watch party.  (ABC News: Emily Clark) \"It's good vibes. It's like homecoming 2.0 to get us in the mood for the results. So it's like just dancing and celebrating Black excellence,\" pre-med student Ashley Johnson told the ABC from deep in the crowd.  A DJ was setting the tone, but once results started to roll in, the screens would switch to the live CNN feed of the count and predictions. At the very start of counting, the crowd erupted as Harris looked, on face value, to be in a good position in some key states.  Early results for Pennsylvania showed a split of more than 60 per cent for Harris. The crowd erupted.  The crowd was feeling energised and hopeful in the very early stages of counting.  (ABC News: Emily Clark) But as international studies student Kima Thi told the ABC, it was that skew in the early counting in the crucial swing state that gave the crowd hope. \"The issue with Pennsylvania is that they counted the Democratic counties first and because of that, we really thought that we had Pennsylvania,\" he said.  \"But as they added in the more conservative counties ... I realised we probably aren't going to have Pennsylvania.  \"I started to realise it might not be a guaranteed Kamala victory.\"  Early Pennsylvania results broadcast to the Harris crowd gave a false sense of hope.  (ABC News: Emily Clark) His friend and journalism student Dru Strand said that's when things changed. \"That's when I think I really saw the mood shift. Especially when we looked at the chart as well, and we saw that Michigan was leading red,\" she said. \"I think all of that really just brought the mood down and really signalled a shift in the crowd.\"   Pennsylvania and its 19 Electoral College votes was always going to help decide the next president and by the time more than 97 per cent of the vote was counted there, Donald Trump had won 50.6 per cent of the vote. Dru Strand said the changing Pennsylvania results brought about a palpable shift in mood.   (ABC News: Emily Clark) Even as the crowd behind them had started to become anxious, Kayla Mambe and friend Elisa Poole were keeping the faith.   \"I know you know it's low here and there, but I'm sure we're going to come out on top,\" Ms Poole said.  Ms Mambe said: \"I'm a little Black girl with dreams and aspirations, and I know with Harris as a president, she understands us, Black ladies.\" \"So we have someone to look up to. We have an idol, we have a sister, we have a mother and president.\"  Eleisha Poole and Kayla Mambe were among the last to leave as the Harris event wrapped up in Washington DC.  (ABC News: Emily Clark) As midnight approached however, the direction of the evening was undeniable.  Everyone gathered knew the seven key races that they needed to pay attention to and there was collective pause as the audio on the CNN feed was pushed up as another update beamed across the Yard.  Around 11pm Harris was about to lose North Carolina.  The big screens broadcast another look at Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and the Sun Belt states of Nevada and Arizona that left the crowd speechless.  By midnight, the organisers pulled the CNN feed and reached for music again, but it was too late. The vibe had shifted and the crowd started to file out.    The large crowd at Howard University thinned out quickly after the result became clear. (Reuters: ) There were some devotees who were waiting to see if their vice-president would address the crowd that had gathered for her, but that question was soon answered too.  Harris's campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond stepped up to the microphone that had been installed in front of the event and the world's media and made an announcement.  \"You won't hear from the vice-president tonight, but you will hear from her tomorrow. She will be back here tomorrow to address not only the HU family, not only to address her supporters, but to address the nation,\" he said.  That said it all. And came as media was starting to break the story that the Harris campaign had told its staff to go to bed.  As the thousands of people who had gathered walked through the hallowed campus of Howard University in the knowledge tens of millions of their fellow Americans had voted down their candidate and the ideas she holds dear, the mood was extremely sombre. There were frustrations, exasperation and ultimately a feeling of despair. Ashley Bland Manlove came to the capital expecting a party. (ABC News: Emily Clark) \"I'm sick to my stomach. I came here to DC to celebrate, and it's very disappointing that so many people believe in the rhetoric of the other party. I don't know if it's misogyny or sexism, but it's upsetting,\" Missouri state member Ashley Bland Manlove told the ABC.  \"The repercussions it could have on our democracy are pretty scary.\"  Ms Bland Manlove said there was a familiar sinking feeling.  \"Two states dropped and I felt it was like Hillary all over again. It was a very scary feeling,\" she said.    Kima Thi is concerned about what a Trump White House will mean for the country. (ABC News: Emily Clark) Mr Thi said: \"We're going to lose the opportunity to fight for our rights in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to reproductive health and also for queer communities and gender-affirming care.  \"The Democrats and Republicans have a history of taking away funding from social services, but the Republicans are so much more passionate about it that I'm just really worried that we're just not going to have much to really like rely on.\" By 1am, the Yard was empty, with Kamala Harris expected to return later in the day to make her concession speech.  Another historic moment, but not the one the crowd had gathered to see. The Harris-Walz event in Washington DC cleared out when the result became clear.

(Reuters: Carlos Barria, file photo) Donald Trump is returning to the White House, leaving allies like Australia — and rivals like China — wondering what might be coming next. Mr Trump is both unpredictable and unconventional, so it is hard to know exactly what to expect from a second term in office. But he has given some strong indications of his plans for the next four years, particularly in areas such as trade and climate policy. And on some big questions of foreign policy, such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, his positions are well known. Here's a quick guide to what Australia can expect — and can't predict — from Trump's return. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Trump is a big fan of tariffs. They were a feature of his first term in office and they look set to be at the centre of his second term. He has floated ideas like a broad 10 per cent tariff on most imports bound for the United States, and hitting China in particular with tariffs of up to 60 per cent. Trump sees tariffs as serving many purposes, like boosting the competitiveness of American-made products, and as a revenue measure to offset tax cuts. Australia narrowly avoided being the subject of new tariffs on locally made steel under the first Trump administration, thanks in part to some careful diplomacy at the time. If Australia wants to be carved out of tariffs again, it will take some careful diplomacy. (Supplied: Nathan River Resources) Ninety-six per cent of Australia's imports to the US are currently tariff-free, under a 20-year-old free trade deal. But carving Australia out of any broad new global tariffs might take more careful diplomacy. What could be even more damaging, however, is a bigger trade war between the US and China. If Trump's new tariffs spark a trade war, the hit to the global economy could be significant. Former US ambassador Arthur Sinodinos warned that, as a trading nation, Australia would have little hope of avoiding getting caught in the crossfire. \"If we have international trade wars, that will have an impact on global trade and investment,\" he said. \"It will flow on to Australia because of the impact on the Chinese economy, if he is able to enact the full program.\" Another key point of interest for Australia would be how Trump handles relations with China more broadly. Trump's first administration was hawkish on China, and Mr Trump has used major speeches to warn \"China is circling Taiwan\". But he has also said he \"got along great\" with China's President, Xi Jinping, and had a \"very strong relationship with him\". There have been suggestions many Chinese leaders were hoping Trump would win, suggesting the unpredictability of a second Trump administration would serve their interests. Australia has only recently eased relations with China after several years in the diplomatic deep freeze. (AAP: Lukas Coch) There has also been speculation Trump might seek a \"grand bargain\" with Mr Xi. Foreign policy experts have warned both scenarios — a Trump administration that takes a confrontational approach to China, and one that seeks a new deal with China — could become extremely complicated for Australia. Another foreign policy question is what a new Trump administration would do on Ukraine. There are strong reservations within Republican ranks about US funding and military support for Ukraine's war effort. Withdrawal of US support could see growing pressure on Australia to step up its own efforts. Trump has been very clear on his plans on climate policy — by and large, he wants the US out. His administration will likely again seek to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, only a few years after the Biden administration reversed Trump's first withdrawal. But Mr Trump may go further this time, withdrawing the US from the United Nations's broader efforts to combat climate change. Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw the United States from the United Nations Paris climate accord. (Supplied: Stephanie Keith / Greenpeace) Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government had sought to make relations on climate and clean energy the \"third pillar\" of the Australia-United States relationship. That element of the relationship now appears to be on very shaky ground. Trump plans to scale up the United States's production of oil and gas, pushing through approvals of new projects across the country. And his administration will also seek to unwind government support for many renewables, particularly the wind industry. One big question is how the Australian government will manage relations with a new Trump administration. When Trump was last elected in 2016, then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull turned to Australian golfer Greg Norman to put him in touch with the president. Ties between the Australian government and the incoming Trump administration may be more developed, and diplomatic minds will have been planning how to manage the relationship. But there are some questions. The current Australian ambassador to the US is Kevin Rudd, and Mr Albanese has already faced questions over whether the former Labor prime minister is the right person to stay on in the role. Trump previously suggested Mr Rudd was \"nasty\" and might not remain long if he was re-elected. Kevin Rudd earned the ire of Donald Trump over criticisms he made before becoming ambassador. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Mr Albanese insists he will stay on, despite suggestions from the Coalition he should be pulled from Washington if need be. Another person backing Mr Rudd is former prime minister Scott Morrison, who now works with consulting firm American Global Strategies. \"Kevin Rudd is doing a fantastic job,\" he said, citing his work on the AUKUS agreement since taking on the job. \"I see no reason why you're making any changes there.\" There is also the question of who the Trump administration will send to Australia to replace outgoing ambassador Caroline Kennedy, which is truly anyone's guess. One of the central features of the Australia-US relationship, particularly in the defence space, is the AUKUS agreement. Most foreign policy experts expect the nuclear submarine deal to endure under the Trump administration, given it is reasonably popular among both Democrats and Republicans. Making sure it stays that way will be a high priority for Australian diplomats in Washington for the next four years. But the federal government is already facing renewed calls to rethink AUKUS given the second ascendancy of Trump, including from within Labor ranks. Australia is progressing a deal with the United States and United Kingdom to acquire nuclear submarines. (Department of Defence) Marcus Strom from lobby group Labor Against War, which has long campaigned against AUKUS, called on the government to dump the deal. \"It is completely untenable for Australia to continue in lock-step with a militarised US government led by an unstable president,\" he said. \"Being part of a heavily integrated military alliance with a Trump presidency is dangerous, expensive and counter to the interests of the Australian people.\" The Greens largely agree, with senator Sarah Hanson-Young arguing now is the time to rethink the deal.

(Reuters: Carlos Barria) President-elect Donald Trump spent several minutes during his victory speech praising his billionaire backer and high-profile ally Elon Musk, stating that \"a star is born\". \"We have a new star. A star is born: Elon,\" Trump said to a roaring crowd of supporters early on Wednesday at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre. The richest man in the world emerged in the back end of 2024 as one of Donald Trump's most high-profile and powerful allies in his election campaign.  Musk attended rallies alongside the incoming president, conducted his own speaking tour, used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging and pumped some $US120 million ($182.8 million) into backing Trump's campaign — most notably his giveaways offering $1 million every day to people in swing states who sign an online petition in support of the US Constitution. Now, Trump has said he will appoint Musk to lead a government efficiency commission. It seems like a match made in heaven — for each other, at least.  But how did they get here? Was Musk really the \"star\" Donald Trump needed to help him to take victory, and what role will he play in a Trump administration? It certainly wasn't love at first sight between the two.  At a campaign rally in Alaska in 2022, Trump called the CEO of Tesla and Space X and the owner of X, formally Twitter, a \"bullshit artist\" for previously supporting the president's former opponents.  Musk donated to Hilary Clinton's 2016 campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission. \"I don't hate the man,\" Musk responded in July 2022, \"but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\" Just one day later, Trump said Musk would have \"begged\" him for government subsidies, in a message on his own social media app, Truth Social. \"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help... without which subsidies he'd be worthless and tell me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump wrote. Two and half years later, Musk spent election night with the Trumps at Mar-a-Largo, and Trump singled him out in his victory speech for being a \"super genius\".  \"Let me tell you, we have a new star. He's a super genius. We have to protect our geniuses. We don't have that many of them,\" Trump said.  So what changed? US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Some may argue that the bromance between Trump and Musk began after Musk's acquisition of then-Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, now known as X.  Whilst Musk was not necessarily Team Trump yet (he used the platform to launch the failed presidential bid of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was challenging Trump for the Republican nomination), he had begun to make clear he was moving away from the Democratic Party. In a post on X in May that same year, Musk said in the past he had voted Democrat \"because they were (mostly) the kindness party\" but they had become \"the party of division & hate\". \"I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,\" he wrote.  In November, Musk reinstated Trump's twitter account after more than 15 million accounts responded to a poll, reversing a ban that had kept the Republican off the social media site following the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Then in 2024, at a Tesla shareholder meeting, Musk said that the two men had \"some conversations\" and Trump is a \"huge fan\" of Tesla's electric pick-up trucks. Trump has reiterated his pledge to immediately abandon the Biden administration's \"mandate\" to support the electric vehicle industry. Musk, who has over 203 million followers on X, has used the social media platform to amplify right-wing conspiracy theories, spread misinformation and promote the Republican candidate.  In July, for example, he shared a video, generated with artificial intelligence and manipulating Vice President Harris' voice, in which Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, described herself as the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and criticised President Joe Biden. By May of 2024, Musk had launched a political action committee (PAC) to support Trump's re-election bid.  Just two months later, after Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennslyvania, Musk formally endorsed Trump for the president of the United States.  And it didn't take long for Musk to emerge as a key player — and key funding —  in the president's election efforts. Musk's America PAC has been giving away $US1 million ($1.5 million) per day to registered voters in key swing states who sign a petition in support of the first and second amendments of the US constitution. Some election experts have argued it violates federal prohibitions on people being paid to either register to vote or cast a ballot, and questions were raised after four of the 12 winners were residents of the crucial swing state Pennsylvania.  ABC's John Lyons said the lottery was \"clearly a stunt\" to try to help Trump, speaking to ABC's Gemma Veness. \"Elon Musk and Donald Trump are joined at the hip at the moment,\" he said. Lyons said the pair \"clearly see their interests as coinciding at the moment\".  \"There are questions though about why they are just in the swing state.\" On Tuesday, Musk was sued by registered voters who signed his petition to win his lottery — saying it was fraud. The complaint filed in a court in the city of Austin says the Tesla boss falsely induced voters to sign by claiming they would choose winners randomly, though they were predetermined. A judge in Philadelphia dismissed a request by prosecutors to end Musk's giveaway, which they called an \"illegal lottery\". After some nudging from the world's wealthiest person, Trump has said he would tap Elon Musk to lead a new government efficiency commission.  Musk has said at least $2 trillion could be cut from the $6.75 trillion federal budget.  And how that works could be a key to the next Trump administration. Does efficiency mean fewer rules and regulators?  Musk has been a vocal critic, for instance, of federal review of his SpaceX rocket business. That could mean less oversight of self-driving cars (a Tesla business) or rocket launches and much more. Philadelphia's district attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, is trying to shut down the lottery being run by the America political action committee set up by Musk to support Donald Trump's election campaign. The two men, however, are not completely in sync: Trump has said he won't let California require all vehicles in the state go electric in a decade, but Musk runs the world's most valuable EV company.  \"A rising tide raises all boats. So to the extent that Elon is able to hamper the vilification of EVs by a potential Trump administration, all the better,\" said James Chen, former head of policy for Rivian and Tesla. How Musk would address conflicts of interest between his interests in autos, space, health, construction and artificial intelligence is not clear. Trump has pledged to be a \"crypto president\", a plan that may start with replacing industry opponent Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission chair who has sued most of the industry – including Coinbase COIN.N, Binance and Kraken.  Gensler's replacement is expected to review — and potentially tear up — accounting guidance and create industry exemptions from SEC rules. Musk, too is a crypto supporter, as is Silicon Valley Trump supporter Marc Andreessen and incoming Vice President J.D. Vance. Musk is also a big proponent of carbon-free energy, with Tesla being a major supplier of solar systems and batteries.  Trump has promised to kill the offshore wind industry and rescind all unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act – Biden's signature climate law.  But Trump faces dissent in his ranks: Republican lawmakers, oil companies and others see massive red state gains from the law.  Musk has played into that, building his second US electric vehicle factory in Texas, for instance.

However, he did win comprehensively by 306 votes to 232 in the Electoral College, despite losing the popular vote to Clinton. By defeating Trump in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden pulled off the first defeat of a sitting president in nearly three decades.

There may be a couple of states still undecided, but Trump has already passed the mark of 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure his return to the White House. He picked up a swing right across the country, and looks to be headed for a win in the popular vote. That will be a first across Trump's three campaigns.

(AP: Jess Rapfogel) Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, has become the first Black candidate elected to represent Maryland in the US Senate. \"It's remarkable to think that in two years, America will celebrate its 250th birthday,\" Ms Alsobrooks said during a victory speech. \"And in all those years, there have been more than 2,000 people who have served in the United States Senate. Only three have looked like me. \"And so, I want to salute all those who came before me, who made it possible for me to stand on this stage tonight, whose sacrifices and stories I will continue to carry with me.\" Ms Alsobrooks, a Prince George's County executive, will be the second female senator from Maryland after Democrat Barbara Mikulski. Democratic representative Lisa Blunt Rochester won her contest for a seat in the US Senate, setting her up to become the first woman and first Black person to represent Delaware. \"The people have spoken, and we're bringing bright hope to the United States Senate,\" Ms Blunt Rochester said in a victory speech to supporters. Lisa Blunt Rochester speaks during an election night watch party. (AP: Gail Burton) She said her run was not about making history, rather about \"making a difference\". Ms Blunt Rochester was considered a shoo-in for the senate against Republican Eric Hansen. Democrats hold a significant voter registration advantage over Republicans in solid-blue Delaware. In addition to becoming their states' first Black senators, Rochester and Alsobrooks will also be the first two Black women to serve simultaneously in the chamber. Their victories also raise the number of Black members of the US Senate to five, the most to serve together in history. Sarah McBride speaks to voters outside of an early voting location in Newark, Delaware. (Reuters: Rachel Wisniewski) Democrat Sarah McBride has become the first openly transgender person elected to serve in Congress, a historic first for the US. McBride easily defeated her Republican opponent, John Whalen III, for Delaware's seat in the House of Representatives. \"Tonight is a testament to Delawareans that we have shown time and time again that in this state of neighbours, we judge candidates based on their ideas and not their identities,\" McBride said. \"I didn't run to make history. I ran to make a difference for my state and this country.\" McBride has established a national profile as an LGBTQ activist and achieved national recognition at the 2016 Democratic National Convention as the first openly transgender person to address a major party in the US. Democrat Andy Kim will be the first Korean American elected to the US Senate. In a recent interview, Mr Kim said that accomplishment would validate his parents' decision 50 years ago to immigrate to the US. Kim is a former Obama administration national security aide, a Rhodes Scholar and has a Ph.D. from Oxford. (AP: J. Scott Applewhite) Mr Kim defeated Republican businessman Curtis Bashaw for the seat that opened when Robert Menendez resigned earlier this year after a federal bribery conviction. Following his victory, Mr Kim told his supporters to see the upcoming 250th anniversary of America's independence as \"a reminder that the greatness of America is not what we take from this country but what we give back\". \"Let us use that extraordinary milestone as a moment of healing,\" he said. Mr Kim gained national attention in 2021 when he was spotted cleaning up the US Capitol after the January 6 insurrection. He will also become the US Senate's third youngest member when he takes the oath of office. Republican Bernie Moreno, who was born in Colombia, will be the first Latino to represent Ohio in the senate. The contest in Ohio was the most expensive senate race this year and among the most expensive ever in US history. According to the Associated Press (AP), Ohio saw half a billion dollars in campaign ad spending this election cycle while Pennsylvania saw $US340 million ($494 million).

In advocating for a Kamala Harris victory on the eve of the US election, Western Australia's premier warned of the \"dark roads\" the now President-elect Trump represented. \"He wants to kill the trade with China, he wants to destroy any sort of trade links between the US and China,\" Roger Cook said. \"China depends upon Western Australian iron ore … so in the event we have a Trump government that's obviously a very concerning development.\" When asked if he was risking the wrath of President Trump in voicing his concern, Mr Cook said he \"didn't care\". President-elect Donald Trump addresses supporters in the early hours of November 6, 2024. (Reuters: Brendan Mcdermid) \"Everyone should be aware of any politician seeking to spread fear, division and hatred in the community,\" he said. \"We depend on our political leaders, bringing the community together and progressing — and clearly the Trump administration don't represent that particular goal.\" The next day, once it became clear Mr Trump had become only the second president to return to office for a non-consecutive second term, the premier had toned the rhetoric down. Premier Roger Cook warned of the \"dark roads\" US president-elect Donald Trump represented. (ABC News: West Matteeussen) \"Quite frankly I do not think those in the US are particularly looking all that closely at us at the moment,\" he told parliament. And on Thursday, Mr Cook was congratulating Mr Trump \"on his successful campaign\". “The United States is a close and important partner for Australia and for WA. It is one of our biggest sources of investment, and our partnership will remain strong into the future – especially through the AUKUS agreement,\" he said. Donald Trump will return to the White House, leaving allies like Australia — and rivals like China — wondering what might be coming next. But even without a direct link between Perth and Washington D.C, many experts say there could be ramifications in Australia’s mining capital. \"We are the most trade-exposed economy in Australia,\" Mr Cook said on Wednesday. \"There is no doubt we are now in a period of global flux in global trading relations which may have an impact on our biggest customer, which is China.\" The Bankwest Curtin Economic Centre's Professor Mike Dockery shared the premier's concerns. \"If we see that those tariffs [on China] go up, it'll affect the global economy, it'll flow on to us, and it'll be inflationary, it'll be bad for real wages, it'll be bad for WA,\" he said. Professor Mike Dockery said tariffs on China would have an impact on wages in WA. (ABC News: Rhiannon Shine) \"It'll be a slowdown in demand for our iron ore, quite possibly a fall in the iron ore price … we know for every dollar it drops off, the WA budget takes a hit. \"On the plus side, one of our main exports to the US is gold and in times of uncertainty the price of gold goes up … there's always two sides to the coin.\" WA's Association of Mining and Exploration Companies chief executive Warren Pearce said the Trump victory wasn't necessarily bad news for WA. \"There are certain people that are very much focused on the [green] energy transition and would see President Trump as a slowdown to that,\" he said. Warren Pearce said there had been a mixed industry response to the Trump election win. (ABC News: West Matteeussen) \"But there are also many in our membership that still recognise the importance of energy reliability and security and want to see that focused on and they'll welcome a Trump presidency.\" In a news story reposted on her website, one of Australia's richest people, Gina Rinehart, said she was opposed to the possibility of Mr Trump imposing tariffs. She expressed concern it could spark a trade war between the US and China, but still strongly supported Mr Trump.  \"Assuming the [president-elect] wins both houses, I’d say his presidency will bring more prosperity to the USA than before,\" she said. \"He’ll be able to accomplish even more than last time. Including making Americans safer when he fixes the border nightmare.” WA mining magnate Gina Rinehart pictured with Donald Trump's son Eric at a 2024 US election day function at Mar-A-Lago in Florida. (Supplied: Hancock Prospecting) The mining magnate even attended his election function at Mar-a-Lago. But another WA mining giant, Andrew Forrest, played down concerns about a trade war. “The amount of horsepower in the tank of China's economy and their ability to self-stimulate is phenomenal … so I'm not sharing [Mr Cook’s] concerns,” he said. Andrew Forrest said he didn't share the premier's concerns about a Trump administration. (AAP Image: James Ross) “The biggest trading partner the United States has ever, and will ever, have is China. Let's not forget that they butter each other's bread.” Defence Industry Minister Paul Papalia was not fazed. “I don't know that people in America are sitting there, watching what's happening inside politics in Western Australia,” he said. “We have some really long standing, deep relationships right across business, academia, politics, between Western Australia and the United States.  “The biggest foreign investor in Western Australia is the United States.

(AP: Alex Brandon) Republican Donald Trump will be the next US president after an historic victory that will send him back to the White House. Although Trump secured enough votes to win on election day, it will be a couple of months before he takes office. Here's what to know about when he will be sworn in. No. Trump becomes the president-elect, and his running mate JD Vance becomes the vice-president elect. January 20, 2025. That's called Inauguration day. On that day, the vice-president, JD Vance, will recite his oath of office and be sworn in first. Trump will then follow about midday, local time. He will then give an inaugural address which typically outlines a president's vision and goals for their term. After the inauguration, Trump will begin work immediately. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  JD Vance. Vance, a 39-year-old Ohio senator, rose to prominence as a venture capitalist and bestselling author of Hillbilly Elegy before making the move into politics.  JD Vance and Donald Trump embrace following early results from the 2024 US election. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) In the past, Vance was a vocal critic of the president-elect, calling him \"dangerous\", \"a cynical asshole\" and \"unfit\" for office. But in just a few years, Vance transformed himself from a \"never Trump\" into one of his most steadfast allies. Until January 20 comes around, Trump and Vance will be building their new administration team which includes everyone from secretary of state to White House aids. Trump has promised roles in his administration to Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as to former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump and Vance will also work with their transition team to organise the handover from President Joe Biden's administration. Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have already committed to \"ensuring a smooth transition\" takes place. Most president-elects also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition period and mandatory protection from the US Secret Service. We don't know yet because votes are still being counted across the country. But at this current point in time, Trump maintains a firm lead of nearly 4.8 million votes over Harris, according to the Associated Press (AP). If Trump manages to win the popular vote — a victory that won't sway the election outcome — he would be the first Republican presidential candidate to do so in two decades. It'll also be the first time he has won the popular vote in any campaign he's run.  In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote. And in 2020 he lost both. But here's why the popular vote doesn't matter — it all comes down to the Electoral College. No. Unless there's a change to the constitution. But more on that below. According to the US constitution, presidents are only permitted to serve two elected terms — or eight years. The exact relevant wording is in the 22nd amendment: No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. This restriction applies even though Trump's two terms in office will not have been consecutive. However, constitutional amendments can be repealed, but it's a difficult process and would involve a lot of work and time. Any proposed amendment would have to be passed by the US House and the Senate with a two-thirds majority. It then must be ratified by three-fourths of the 50 states. Trump will head back to the White House on January 2025. (Reuters: Hannah McKay) It's also difficult to say whether Trump will even want to run again in 2028. He has been inconsistent with his remarks and by the time he leaves office in 2028, he will be 82-years-old. Old age might catch up to him.

With dozens of states and thousands of counties, the story of the night can be told and retold in endless ways. But it's the simplest number that best sums up Donald Trump's remarkable return to the presidency: 72 million Americans voted for him, and 67 million voted for Kamala Harris. That may not be how presidents are chosen — the labyrinthine electoral college system means the nationwide leader can, and often does, lose the election. It's also not a final figure, with votes left to count in California that will likely narrow, but not eliminate, Trump's lead. But it's a striking result because it's something Republicans rarely win — Joe Biden beat Trump by millions of votes on that measure, as did Hillary Clinton, helped by massive margins in populous states like California and New York. Not this time. In bluest New York, Biden's 2020 lead has been halved. In California, it has been eroded by 12 percentage points, with the important caveat that many Democrat-skewed mail-in votes are yet to be counted. And even in Massachusetts and DC — the US equivalents of Melbourne and Canberra, as John Howard might put it — Trump gained eight points and two points respectively. None of which disproves the conventional wisdom that the country is bitterly divided. Harris still won at least three-quarters of the vote in San Francisco, Manhattan and Boston. But it is the \"swing\", in Australian vernacular, which decides elections, and the swing to Trump was remarkably uniform. Only in conservative Utah and liberal Washington has Harris improved on Biden's margins, both by a matter of inches. Not that this reflects on Harris herself, necessarily — her position in opinion polls was stronger than Biden's had been before he dropped out of the race, dangling the unanswerable question of whether Biden might even have lost \"safe\" states like New Jersey had he remained the candidate. More tangible is what this means for the future. The polarised electoral map that had characterised the Trump era saw a sea of red in rural areas balanced out by the blue splotches of the cities. Winning pivotal states like Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan was about who could \"get out the vote\" in their respective turfs, and then win the balance in the more finely balanced suburbs. This win was different and has shaken that path for Democrats. Trump got out the vote in rural areas, where he gained even more ground than before. But while voter numbers were also strong in cities, especially those in swing states, they too swung to Trump. It is a similar story in the demographic breakdown of the results, which we don't know with precision but can approximate with the results of Votecast, a voter survey from the Associated Press. Again, the conventional story has been that American voters are polarised along almost every demographic divide — between white voters and non-white, young and old, male and female, and those with and without college degrees. Barack Obama's ability to win among women, young voters and non-white voters — dubbed his \"rainbow coalition\" — was key to his electoral success. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  And while there were some signs this was eroding in 2020, like the shift to Trump among Hispanic voters in Florida and Texas, it was still key the Democrats' path for victory. But this time, Trump gained among almost every demographic group. Among voters under 30, he gained 19 points. Among black voters, 16 points. Among those with Puerto Rican ancestry, 15 points. Among those with college degrees, six points. There were important differences within groups. Much has been made of the \"bros for Trump\" momentum, and he did gain a particularly pronounced swing among young men (+31) and especially young black men (+36). But even so, young women (+14) and black women (+7) shifted the same way. Even the demographic of \"childless cat ladies,\" disparaged by vice-president-elect JD Vance, Harris claimed by only 12 points. In all these cases, the gaps still exist and are in many cases wide. But the shift was enough to matter. Among young women in Michigan alone, Harris' slide was worth more than 100,000 votes, most of the margin of Joe Biden's 2020 victory in that state. Young women swung to Trump by a substantial margin, as did voters in most demographic groups. (Reuters: Jeenah Moon) And among black women in Georgia alone, the Democratic ticket slid 70,000 votes, more than enough to flip the state.

Trump took the electoral college and the popular vote, with it looking possible the Republicans could take the Senate and the House. Harris said the Democrats would \"engage in a peaceful transfer of power\" before Trump's inauguration in January. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has conceded the election to Donald Trump, saying she respects the result but would not give up the fight that fuelled her campaign. \"The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up, and as long as we keep fighting,\" she said. The vice-president did not speak on election night, leaving Trump in the unusual position of claiming victory before most networks declared he had enough votes or before his opponent had conceded. Voters delivered the Republican Party a decisive victory. By Wednesday morning, local time, Trump had won all the swing states that had been called — and taken the popular vote for the first time. His party will also likely gain a majority in the Senate, while possibly keeping control of the House of Representatives after Tuesday's election. Harris said she had spoken with Trump earlier on Wednesday and congratulated him on his victory, before joining supporters at Howard University, the scene of her election watch party the night before. \"I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,\" she said. \"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honour it. At the same time in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States.\" Early Wednesday, US President Joe Biden also called Trump to congratulate him. \"President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasised the importance of working to bring the country together,\" the White House said. The Yard at Howard University filled up again, just hours after disappointed supporters went home. The DJ played, but in the cold light of day, this felt much less like a party than it did 24 hours ago. There was still some denial, with several people saying they showed up both to support Harris and to hear from her directly that the dream was really over. In Washington DC, a safe blue spot, Trump's win will mean massive changes inside the public service, so the impact isn't just a political or ideological one. Many people will lose their jobs as Trump and his teams move back into town. Jacob Carroll and Maxe Hinds are still processing the election result.  (ABC News: Emily Clark) Jacob Carroll and Maxe Hinds came down to hear Harris speak. \"The popular vote really stood out to me, and I've just been trying to figure out what the disconnect is for voters in this country,\" Carroll said. \"In comparison to Trump, and really in comparison to anybody she could have been contending with, she's the most qualified — judicial branch, the legislative branch and the executive branch… \"I don't know what more she could have done to showcase to voters that she cared. She actually had a plan, not concepts. I think that's just what confused me. \"The reality is that she is a Black woman. The reality of this situation, reality of where we are as a society, is that we're just not ready for a Black woman,\" Hinds added. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Anijah Johnson said the result doesn't feel real for her right now. \"I don't think I've ever cried like that in a couple of years,\" Johnson said. \"I just need to see her, hear her voice, like she's a phenomenal woman. And I just feel like she was wronged. She was definitely wronged. \"I'm from Georgia, so I don't even want to go back home, I want to stay here. Because I'm just like, what did we do? If she either got Georgia or Pennsylvania ... she would have gotten it, and it's just like, to not get either of them!\" Many returned to Howrd University on Wednesday morning after not hearing from Kamala Harris the night before.\n\n  (ABC News: Emily Clark) Harris thanked her husband Doug Emhoff, the Bidens, her running mate Tim Walz and his wife, along with her team, volunteers and electoral officials. \"Over the 107 days of this campaign, we've been intentional about building community and building coalitions. Bringing people together from every walk of life, and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future.\" But she had a special message for the young people watching in the crowd, and around the world. \"It is okay to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be okay. On the campaign, I would often say, when we fight, we win,\" she said. \"But here's the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win.

He was right. Voters not only swept Trump into the White House for a second time at Tuesday's election, but delivered his Republican Party a likely majority in the Senate and a possible one in the House of Representatives. This resounding victory was no shock to Pennsylvania voter Brian Shank. Throughout the campaign, he'd been using his \"Trump trailer\" — featuring a homemade lookalike of the Republican candidate — to attract Trump fans and help them register to vote in the swing county of Erie. Brian Shank campaigned for Donald Trump and urged fans to register to vote. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) Erie has a reputation for being a reliable bellwether — that is, whichever candidate wins the county tends to become president. And the level of public support for Mr Shank's novel trailer gave him confidence the county would back Trump. \"When we had the trailer down at the dock, we would have had 98 per cent of people passing by giving thumbs up, beeping, saying 'hey, thank you, let's make America great again',\" Mr Shank said. True to form, the county flipped from Democrat to Republican at this election. So did enough of the state for Trump to take Pennsylvania's 19 electoral college votes and win the presidency. He also flipped the other crucial battlegrounds of Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, which took him past the 270 electoral college votes he needed to become president under the US system. Two swing states are still up for grabs as ballots continue to be counted, but Trump is leading his Democratic rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, in both. On top of that, he looks set to win the popular vote: something he had never done before, which — while not essential to victory — added an exclamation point to his performance. Trump and his team have two months before he is inaugurated. Brian Shank flipped from being a Democratic voter during the 2016 election. (ABC News: Jade Macmillan) Mr Shank did his own flip back in 2016, voting for Trump after decades as a \"Democrat union guy\". The party has shifted too far from the priorities of the working class, he said, and that's why it's losing support. \"I don't think the Democratic Party truly represents the working guy as they pretend to,\" Mr Shank said. \"The Republicans were the fat cat business guys. Those rules have changed. \"I mean, they have literally flipped to where the Republican Party is more of the boots-in-the-ground working class folks.\" While the Republicans had already won a majority in the Senate after claiming at least two seats off the Democrats, things were less certain in the House of Representatives, where multiple races were yet to be called. Although, as counting continues, a majority is possible there too. Speaking Wednesday morning, local time, veteran Republican senator Mitch McConnell, who is the party's leader in the chamber, said the results were \"a referendum\" on Biden's administration. \"People were just not happy with this administration and the democratic nominee was obviously a part of it,\" he said. The international outlook is set for a major shake-up — and the most dramatic change would be regarding the war in Ukraine. If the Republicans control both houses of Congress, it means Trump would have unfettered ability to enact his agenda, which will likely include seismic foreign policy shifts — he's promised to stop funding Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion, for instance. McConnell said he would do \"everything he can to help the new administration be successful\". \"I think this is the most dangerous time since right before World War II,\" he said. He said America's adversaries including North Korea, Russia, China and Iran were \"all talking to each other\". \"They have one thing in common, they hate us, and they want to diminish our role in the world,\" the 82-year-old said. As the result continued to sink in, Republican senator, Marco Rubio, told CNN on Wednesday morning: \"What I'm most impressed by is not just the size of the victory, I know the number is still growing, but the way the way DT won this election. \"He won it by fundamentally remaking the Republican Party but I hope also revealing to people for voters in the United States of America, the primary identity is not their ethnicity its not their race its what they do for a living its who they are in their daily life.\" Polling ahead of the election had consistently shown voters rated Trump as a better economic manager than his rival. Democratic nominee Harris, who did not take the stage at her official campaign event on Tuesday night, conceded the election to Trump on Wednesday, local time. She told supporters that she respected the result but would not give up the fight that fuelled her campaign. Kamala Harris did not speak at her official election party in Washington DC on Saturday night. (Reuters: Daniel Cole) Among the changes heading America's way is a shake-up of public health agencies, which Trump has been particularly scathing of. Robert F. Kennedy Junior, who stood unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential ticket before standing as an independent and, eventually, joining team Trump, has claimed he will be put in charge of those. Last week, he took to social media to say one of the first acts of the new administration — if elected — would advise that fluoride be removed from public water systems. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned relentlessly for Trump, also appears set to have a significant role in the new administration. In his victory speech, Trump described the world's richest man as a \"super genius\". \"Let me tell you we have a new star … a star is born, Elon,\" the president-elect told supporters, to loud cheers, before adding later: \"We have to protect our geniuses, we don't have that many of them.\" Iowa pastor Joel Tenney was inside the watch party in West Palm Beach as the result was declared. \"It's very hard to explain, because it was very surreal. It was a dream come true for me and millions of Americans, and so the celebration … the energy in that room was incomparable to anything else I've experienced in the world,\" he said. He said he wanted to be \"part of history\". \"I wanted to be in the room and see Trump's face and see the face of Melania and his family when they were vindicated before the entire nation. And I got to do that,\" Mr Tenney said. Joel Tenney and his wife Sarah celebrate at the Palm Beach County Convention Center on Tuesday night. (Reuters: Callaghan O'hare) Trump, who was the subject of two assassination attempts during his campaign, told supporters at his official event that he wanted to bring the country together. His victory came despite numerous polls predicting a surge of support for the Democrats and Harris in the week preceding the vote. The 78-year-old, who was twice impeached during his previous term in office, prevailed despite low approval ratings and numerous court battles. He was also handed the resounding triumph after he questioned — without evidence — the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden where an angry mob of his supporters subsequently stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC. Trump has been criminally indicted multiple times, and earlier this year, a jury found him guilty of falsifying business records. In civil trials, he has been found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Bill Bretz believes there's a lot to like about the incoming government. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Among all the swing states, Pennsylvania, and its 19 electoral college votes, was the juiciest prize on offer in Tuesday's vote. In Westmoreland County, just outside Pittsburgh, Republican committee chair Bill Bretz was celebrating the result. He said Trump had \"won a mandate to bring his platform into public policy\". \"I think it's very important that he tries to unify the country,\" he said. \"This race has got to be pretty contentious and, moving forward, that's pointless. We need to bring everybody together.\" Mr Bretz said while he didn't agree with everything Trump said, he was hopeful the new president would \"bring peace and prosperity to every nation that's in our umbrella\".

The former president returns to the top job as the oldest commander-in-chief in the record books, the second man to win non-consecutive terms in office, and as the first convicted felon to ever win a presidential election. It's that last point that feels particularly poignant in the aftermath of the decisive victory delivered on November 5. Because Trump is facing a raft of legal battles, ranging from allegations of fraud to the mishandling of classified documents and very serious charges of attempting to overturn the 2020 election. But his victory in one of the most widely watched elections of all time now offers him a pathway to avoid accountability for his alleged crimes. It has been a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, partly because it would interfere with their ability to perform their constitutional abilities. Special counsel Jack Smith is now evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases against Trump — one relating to classified documents and the other on overturning the 2020 election — before the president-elect takes office. Smith is likely aware that he could lose his job once the former president is installed in the Oval Office. When Trump was asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he would \"pardon yourself\" or \"fire Jack Smith\" if re-elected, the Republican replied: \"I would fire him within two seconds.\" The slowing down of the two federal cases against Trump would allow the president-elect to enter the White House without the threat of felony convictions or prison sentences hanging over his head. His ascension to the highest office in the land may also complicate some of the civil cases against him, though his new title does not protect him from these suits. Here's where the array of court cases against Trump in each state stand and what his victory will likely mean for these legal battles. Trump's most pressing legal issues lie in his hometown of New York. Back in May — which admittedly feels like it was 1,000 years ago — Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. They relate to efforts to cover up an affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels, a claim Trump denies. When Stormy Daniels testified, a photo of her and Donald Trump from their first meeting was displayed on a monitor. (AP: Elizabeth Williams) Sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, but it was delayed until November 26 when Trump's legal team successfully argued it would interfere with the election campaign. \"This matter is one that stands alone, in a unique place in this nation's history,\" Justice Juan Merchan wrote in his decision. \"We are now at a place in time that is fraught with complexities rendering the requirements of a sentencing hearing, should one be necessary, difficult to execute.\" So what happens now? While he could be sentenced to jail time due to the nature of his felony convictions, he could also face home confinement, community service and some stiff fines. But Trump's legal team is likely to press for another delay — potentially for up to four years until his second term of office ends. There's also a chance the case gets dropped altogether due to a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that grants presidents broad immunity for \"core activity\" in office. Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in a New York courtroom in May.   (Reuters: Jane Rosenberg) Trump's legal team has argued that much of the evidence used in the hush money trial should be thrown out since the Supreme Court expanded the scope of presidential immunity. Justice Merchan said he will make a decision on that by November 12. If he tosses out the case, Trump will no longer be a convicted felon. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  The greatest impact of Trump's election victory will likely be on the two federal cases brought against him by Mr Smith in the nation's capital and the former president's heartland of Florida. The prosecutor has spent years building a case to convict Trump over his efforts to overturn his election loss in 2020, which culminated in the insurrection on January 6, 2021. The former president was charged with four counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the US, and conspiracy to prevent others from carrying out their constitutional rights. Donald Trump's return to the White House will likely mean he will evade some of his upcoming court battles. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) But the case, which was centred in Washington DC where the insurrection on the Capitol took place, stalled earlier this year as the court considered Trump's argument that he had presidential immunity. In July, the Supreme Court found former presidents did have significant protection from criminal prosecution, delivering a huge blow to the DC case and delaying the trial until after the election. America's highest court sent the matter back to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine what elements of the case could move forward to trial. Last month, Mr Smith's legal team alleged in a 165-page brief that the insurrection actions were taken in Trump's private capacity as a candidate, and therefore can remain part of the case. Trump's lawyers were also due to submit their response later this month but the case is now under a cloud due to reports Mr Smith is in negotiations to end his two prosecutions. The talks would also impact other charges brought by Mr Smith against the president-elect, which accuse Trump of illegally taking classified documents from the White House and resisting the government's attempts to retrieve the materials. US Special Counsel Jack Smith is reportedly in talks with the Justice Department to wind back the two federal cases against Trump. (Reuters: Kevin Wurm) It has been dubbed the Florida case, since Trump kept the documents at his Mar-a-Lago property, and has been held up since July when a Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, dismissed it on the grounds that Mr Smith was illegally appointed. She claimed his nomination was unconstitutional because he was not appointed by the president or confirmed by Congress. Prosecutors were appealing her ruling, though it is now unclear whether this will go ahead. Multiple US media outlets are reporting that Mr Smith is in active talks with senior leadership at the DOJ to dismiss both cases, with no firm details yet on how this will be done. It's expected the discussions will last several days. Trump is also awaiting a criminal trial in the state of Georgia, where he's facing state charges for conspiring to illegally overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. But that case has been mired in controversy and has effectively been on hold for months. Earlier this year, it was revealed that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been engaged in a secret relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to assist in her investigation. The Georgia case against Trump was thrown into dissaray when Fani Willis and Nathan Wade confirmed they are in a romantic relationship.  (Reuters: Elijah Nouvelage) Trump's legal team has argued she should be disqualified from pursuing the case against him, something a Georgia appeals court is expected to decide in early December. If Willis is removed, it would mean Georgia officials have to find another prosecutor to take up the case. But whether it's Willis or someone else, it's likely that this case would also be delayed until Trump is no longer in office. And in case you're wondering, Trump would not have the power to pardon himself, or his 18 alleged co-conspirators in this case. Presidential pardon powers do not extend to state cases, only federal ones. While things are looking good for Trump in terms of his criminal issues, civil suits are a different matter altogether. He is currently facing several civil matters that could cost him upwards of $US500 million in damages, including: Trump is appealing a court order to pay writer E Jean Carroll tens of millions in damages for damages.  (Reuters: Shannon Stapleton) Unlike criminal matters, a president has no legal protections from civil cases. This precedent was set in 1997 when Paula Jones sued then-president Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. She sued Mr Clinton, claiming he propositioned her when he was still the governor of Arkansas, seeking damages. Mr Clinton tried to have the case dismissed on the grounds that he enjoyed presidential immunity. The Supreme Court ruled that  Bill Clinton was not immune from civil suits related to matters that occurred before he won the White House.  (Reuters) But the Supreme Court ruled that a sitting president has no immunity from civil litigation for acts done before taking office and unrelated to the office. Ms Carroll has already said that Trump's re-election will do nothing to dissuade her as her case goes through the appeals process. \"Mr Trump's election to the presidency does nothing to change either the fact, as determined by two separate juries, that he sexually assaulted and defamed Ms Carroll, or the applicable legal principles under which he was held liable for that conduct,\" Ms Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan said in a statement to ABC News.

You can follow the latest from the US election in today's US election blog. Donald Trump's campaign has said he will pick his team in coming days, with speculation billionaire Elon Musk may join the administration. Meanwhile, former US president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton urged the incoming administration to govern \"for all of us\", while Silicon Valley CEOs added their congratulations to the Trump camp. Take a look back on today's events.  By Maddy Morwood Thanks for joining us today during our coverage of the 2024 election today. It's a new day in the United States and we're expecting US President Joe Biden to make an address to the nation at 11am in Washington DC, which will be 3am AEDT.  Shortly, we will be moving over to another blog where we will bring you all the latest updates from Biden's speech and the continued wash-up of the US election results. Stay tuned! By Thomas Morgan One of the biggest flashpoints Donald Trump will have to contend with is relations with the US' biggest trading partner: China. It's been a strained relationship, especially because America has made a point of backing the tiny (and democratic) island of Taiwan. When he was last elected, Trump caused a diplomatic incident by becoming the first US president to take a call from Taiwan's then-president, Tsai Ing-wen. That was a breach a longstanding agreement between China and the US. Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China.  But Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University, has told the Associated Press he doubts the incoming president would cross any red lines with the CCP. “Will (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,” he said. Trump has previously threatened to impose high tariffs (up to 200 per cent) on Chinese goods if China invades Taiwan. Since Trump left office, Beijing has also grown more emboldened in recent years about its ambition to re-annex the island. Reporting with AP By Leigh Sales Why is it unlikely that Kamala will run again in 2028? - Shelby A few reasons. One is that when you've had an unsuccessful run for the Presidency – and a comprehensive defeat at that — it's unlikely your colleagues in the Democrat party are going to select you in any future primary and give you a second shot at it. Two is that history shows major parties almost never opt for a black candidate or a female one to head their tickets. The highest probability is that next time, both Democrats and Republicans will go for what they almost always go for: a white man. Three, Harris can probably now enjoy a very lucrative career on the public speaking and corporate circuit, capitalising on her historic position as the first female Vice President in American history, and working a lot less hard than she has for the past 100 days. It's possible we could see candidate Harris back in the future, but highly unlikely. *This question was from an earlier Q+A* By Maddy Morwood With the campaign behind him, Donald Trump will now begin the process of choosing a cabinet and selecting other high-ranking officials and staff. While it is not totally clear who Trump will select, the president-elect has been outspoken on the role Robert F Kennedy Jr will play in the Trump administration. At a campaign event in New York City, Trump said that he would let the former presidential candidate \"go wild\" on vaccine and healthcare policy. \"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on the medicines.\" RFK Jr, whose slogans during the election campaign included \"Make America Healthy Again\" has said that Trump promised him control over the FDA, CDC, HHS, and the USDA. Those jobs could potentially give him control over what vaccines are approved and whether Americans are recommended to receive them. Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick has said RFK Jr is not going to be put in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, but suggested he could advise on vaccines. Reporting with Reuters By Louise Miolin With stock markets strengthening overnight, the boss of National Australian Bank, Andrew Irvine, says Trump's victory provides certainty for the world. \"I think there's a perception that Donald Trump will be positive for America's economy,\" he told the ABC's Peter Ryan for The World Today. \"Generally speaking, a strong America is good for the world. But Mr Irvine said he's cautious about Trump's plans to ramp up tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"We wouldn't want to see a trade war with China,\" he says, \"Those are the two biggest economies in the world, and I think no one wins.\" He said while a trade war was a \"cause for concern,\" many Aussie businesses have been forced to diversify beyond the Chinese market – which Irvine said is a good thing. \"If there is a trade war, that puts us in the best possible position to navigate it.\" By Alexandra Barwick Ukrainians are \"hoping for the best from a Trump administration\", according to a global affairs analyst. Michael Bociurkiw, who is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, is in Kyiv and he's told NewsRadio's Gavin Coote Ukrainians are \"very pragmatic\".  \"There's no panic going on,\" he said. Mr Bociurkiw says people hope in the final weeks of the Biden administration, the US gives Ukraine everything they've previously promised. \"For example, giving Ukraine everything they pledged, but also allowing Ukraine to strike deeper inside Russia with US provided and western provided missiles,\" he says. Donald Trump will try and end the war as he promised but it will not be in Ukraine's favour, Mr Bociurkiw believes \"Because JD Vance has said — that number one, the Russians get to hold on to whatever they've seized or invaded; number two — they'll be some kind of ill-defined demilitarised zone, and number three is that Ukraine has to drop its NATO bid,\" he says. \"This is something that would not fly here at all. \"Putin's not to be trusted … even if he agrees to do something, he may renege on his deal.\" The election comes as Mr Bociurkiw says Putin continues its drone attacks on Ukraine. \"On average, Ukraine is getting 60 or so drones a day, and also those missile attacks wearing them down.\" By Maddy Morwood Good evening! I'm Maddy Morwood. Tessa Flemming has signed off for the night and myself and my colleague Liana Walker will be with you for the next few hours. Here's a recap of today's big events: We're still waiting on the results for battleground states Arizona and Nevada, as well as the US House of Representatives.  Stick with us as we bring you all the updates! By Tessa Flemming  Former PM Malcolm Turnbull says Donald Trump's election win means Australia is less likely than ever to get American nuclear submarines. He was speaking on Radio National Breakfast with Patricia Karvelas, and described the AUKUS agreement as a “dud deal”. Under the agreement Australia will buy five Virginia class submarines from the United States, but Mr Turnbull said that was only if the superpower had a surplus of the vessels. “The deal that Morrison instigated and Albanese signed up to is a very, very asymmetrical deal — all of the risk is on Australia,” he said. “The one least likely to sympathise with someone who's signed up to a dud deal is Donald Trump.” Listen to more of the interview below: By Tessa Flemming  American elections are ripe for information overload. With dozens of states and thousands of counties, the story of the night can be told and retold in endless ways. But it's the simplest number that best sums up Donald Trump's remarkable return to the presidency: 72 million Americans voted for him, and 67 million voted for Kamala Harris. While not yet a final figure, it's a striking result because the popular vote is something Republicans rarely win. My colleague Tom Crowley delves further into how Trump was able to secure those votes when countless others have failed. By Tessa Flemming  Earlier, we brought you a snippet of Investigative journalist Bob Woodward's chat with 7.30.  Here's some more from that interview. \"People grow, even old men,\" Woodward told the ABC program. \"He has to know he has an opportunity to rise above himself in so many of his instincts and impulses, and if he does that, he could really do something.\" You can check out the full story below: By Tessa Flemming  In a campaign heavily focused on the Gen Z vote, the younger members of the Harris Walz campaign became an indelible facet. Whether it was Ella Emhoff's knitting, or Guz Walz's tears — they helped bring the election to a younger cohort. Now one of them — Hope Walz — has spoken out. \"it has been the honor of my lifetime working to elect @kamalaharris and my dad,\" she wrote. \"i come out of it a better, kinder, more confident, and compassionate person.\" She said she knows America is not a place of \"hate but one of hope\". \"it's going to take me a long time to find the words for how i'm feeling in this moment,\" she says. \"let's feel the feels and then begin again, knowing that hope is always there, we may just have to dig a little deeper to find it.\" By Tessa Flemming  Given Trump's track record on LGBTQ+ rights during his previous term, what specific actions do you anticipate he might take regarding queer rights if he were to win another term? Additionally, are there any particular areas, like healthcare or education, where the queer community should be especially vigilant? - Amilie Hi Amilie, Thanks for your question. During his campaign, Trump particularly focused on trans protections, and targeting gender-affirming care. He said on 'day one' of his presidency, he would reverse Biden administration legislation that prohibits federally funded schools from preventing transgender students from using spaces such as bathrooms that align with their gender identities. He's also said he would ask Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and to ban hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors in all 50 states. It should be noted every major medical association in the US supports health care for transgender people. LGBTQIA+ nonprofit GLAAD also has a tracker monitoring Trump's statements on the community, that you can find here.  And, if you're still interested in more areas of concerns facing LGBTQIA+ Americans, I actually did some research into this exact topic prior to the election: By Tessa Flemming  Earlier, I gave a bit of a vibe check from four of the seven swing states.  Here's pics from the ground in the other three: Donald Trump won the vote by 51.1 per cent. Donald Trump won the vote by 50.5 per cent. Donald Trump won the vote by 49.7 per cent. By Esther Linder On his way to the White House for the second time, Donald Trump saw swings to him in virtually every single state including in traditionally \"safe\" blue states. The ABC's election analyst Casey Briggs and reporter Tom Crowley break down some more of the demographic shifts in voting trends we saw in yesterday's US election, including \"one big sea of red\": By Phoebe Hosier Lydia Darrow was part of a team who knocked on a total of 400,000 doors in the swing state of Pennsylvania on election day. The college student, who is due to graduate this fall, volunteered for the Harris campaign in its final weeks. \"We ran a great ground effort,\" she says. \"Trump's ground game sucked but he still won because I think the Democrats need to do a better job of reaching everyone … [especially] working class voters. \"I think they definitely failed on that this time around.\" Results show Americans without a college degree were among those who delivered the election for Donald Trump. His campaign focused on pithy messages like \"no tax on tips\" and \"drill baby drill\" that cut through to the working class voter bloc. Meanwhile, Howard University student Jada White was resolved to view the Vice-President's loss in a positive light. \"I'm just super proud of her and the campaign she ran,\" she says. \"I'm disappointed — especially because I thought the race would be tighter — but I'm just putting all my faith in the Lord and we'll see what happens.\" By Esther Linder You'd be forgiven for thinking there were just two candidates for the White House this year in Kamala Harris and Donald Trump - but in fact there were three others that gained hundreds of thousands of votes, if not the millions needed to win the presidency. American Green party candidate Jill Stein, independent Robert F Kennedy Jr and the Libertarian Party's Chase Oliver all gathered voters backing them as preferred president. And despite independent Kennedy withdrawing from the race in August (and throwing his support behind Trump), he was still on ballot papers in several states. Nationally, AP's data show how many people voted for them: Also, according to AP's election data, a candidate named Vermin Supreme won 914 votes. By Tessa Flemming  There were seven swing states this election. Here's a look at four of them as results trickle in: We're still waiting for official results in Arizona. Maricopa County officials say they've got more than 700,000 ballots left to count. The Associated Press estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results. Donald Trump won Georgia with 50.7 per cent of the vote. Donald Trump won Michigan with 49.8 per cent of the vote. The Associated Press estimates there's more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada — including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and US Senate, both are too early to call. By Tessa Flemming  Congratulating Donald Trump on his win would have been a painful phone call for Joe Biden.  In recent years, he could barely bring himself to call Trump by name. Instead, he would refer to him as \"my predecessor\". Now, Biden can just as accurately describe Trump as \"my successor\". As my colleague Carrington Clarke details, it's a cruel twist of fate for the man currently occupying the White House. By Tessa Flemming  Investigative journalist Bob Woodward has written books on the last 10 US presidents and conducted 19 hours of taped interviews with Donald Trump. He's also perhaps best known for his work unearthing the Watergate scandal. But in his latest book, War, he came to this conclusion about the now president-elect: \"Donald Trump is not only the wrong man for the presidency, he is unfit for the country\". Woodward describes Trump as \"the most reckless and impulsive president in American history\" and says he was demonstrating \"the very same character\" as the presidential candidate in 2024. Despite the warning, Woodward is choosing to remain optimistic about the president-elect. \"I have that strain, it may be really thin, of optimism that he'll rise to the occasion.\" Watch the full interview with 7.30's Sarah Ferguson tonight on ABC iview. By Tessa Flemming  Former speaker Nancy Pelosi says millions of Americans are \"proud of the leadership and campaign\" of Kamala Harris. She also says she's praying for \"America's success under the next Administration\". \"The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy,\" she wrote on X. \"After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\" Her statement comes after reelection to US House in California’s 11th Congressional District, which represents most of San Francisco. The win ushers in a landmark 20th term for the politician, according to The Hill.  She remains the first and only woman to serve as speaker of the US House of Representatives until stepping down in 2022.

(AP Photo: Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File) Donald Trump's presidency could change the trajectory of Russia's war in Ukraine, challenge NATO's stability and make European defence spending a top priority, analysts say. Leaders across Europe, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenkskyy, were quick to congratulate Trump on his victory over Kamala Harris on Wednesday. Shortly after the result was confirmed, Mr Zelenskyy said he looked forward to an \"era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership\". However, one leader yet to comment was Russian President Vladimir Putin. Instead, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reaffirmed Russia's claim that the United States' support for Ukraine amounted to its involvement in the conflict. Mr Peskov said he was not aware of any plans by Mr Putin to congratulate Trump on his victory. \"Let's not forget that we are talking about the unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state,\" Mr Peskov said. \"The US can help end the conflict,\" he said, adding: \"It certainly can't be done overnight.\" But experts say many countries are bracing for potentially radical changes to US foreign policy that could have significant impacts, including on Russia's war in Ukraine. In the lead-up to the election, Trump repeatedly said he could end the almost three-year-long war \"within 24 hours\", without providing details. Experts expect him to push for a quick resolution. \"I think that he will spend the first few weeks, months, trying very hard to push Ukraine to accept a deal that many of us in Europe wouldn't like to see it accept,\" director of the British Foreign Policy Group Evie Aspinall told the ABC. \"Ukraine may be forced to — we are very reliant on the US for support for Ukraine and for European security in general.\" The fighting did not stop near Kharkiv as the US election result was announced on Wednesday. (AP Photo: Efrem Lukatsky) There are long-standing concerns that a second Trump presidency would see him try and force Ukraine into an unfavourable peace deal, involving it giving up land occupied by Russia. Russia currently occupies some 20 per cent of Ukraine and has said it will not end the war until its annexations are recognised. That includes Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, about 80 per cent of the Donbas and more than 70 per cent of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Kyiv has refused to give up its land for peace. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said Trump would likely push for swift talks to end the war but did not think he would bow to Russia's demands. \"I don't think that Trump would agree to peace only on Russia's terms, as this would look like a defeat for the US, and his advisers understand this,\" Mr Fesenko told Reuters news agency. \"Putin can come up with the new ultimatums, which will be certainly unacceptable for Ukraine and the main issue will be, how Trump will react to it.\" Trump has also expressed frustration at the tens of billions of dollars in aid America provides Ukraine. Mr Fesenko predicted that aid provided by the US under Trump's administration would change from grants to something more akin to a loan. He said that was better than aid ending altogether, but was an \"additional burden\" for the future. NATO chief Mark Rutte congratulated Trump on his election victory on X. \"His leadership will again be key to keeping our alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO,\" Mr Rutte said. Despite Ukraine not being a member, NATO's support for Ukraine has been critical in its fight against Russia. The US is the alliance's biggest funder, but Trump has been critical of the body, arguing European nations pay too little. Vladimir Putin has no plans to call Donald Trump. (Reuters: Sputnik/Aleksey Nikolskyi/Kremlin) He has also previously claimed that his threats to pull the US from the alliance led to other countries increasing their expenditure. Ms Aspinall said Europe had changed a lot since Trump was last in power, with countries realising they needed to be more self-sufficient and less reliant on the US. \"Europe knows it needs to invest more in its defence security post the war in Ukraine particularly, but also as you see events in the Middle East, in China … there's a growing recognition across Europe that even if Kamala Harris had won, actually they would need to scale up their investment in European security,\" she said. \"There's a whole cultural mind shift that needs to happen in order to increase defence spending … it's very hard, especially when the economy in Europe is struggling to convince the public that what they really need to do is spend more on guns and bombs and stuff that might not even be used.\" America's NATO allies Germany and France called a high-level defence meeting on Wednesday night to discuss the election result. Several European countries, including France, have been increasingly critical of Israel's conduct in the Middle East war. During the campaign, Ms Harris made it clear she was unhappy with the number of civilian deaths in Gaza. Trump, on the other hand, has said Israel should \"finish the job\", without detailing exactly what that means. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  \"We know that Trump is going to be much more ardently behind [Benjamin] Netanyahu, much more willing to let Israel get kind of whatever it wants,\" Ms Aspinall said. \"I think in Europe there is going to be a lot of discomfort with that, which is much more fundamental and ideological than their discomfort with his approach to China, because they kind of like China and they want to do trade. \"There's a moral argument in Europe, which is quite different to that in the US. \"I think that's going to be a particularly challenging part of the relationship.\" French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Trump but acknowledged the challenges his \"America First\" protectionist trade policy and isolationist rhetoric could have. Trump last month said that the European Union would \"pay a big price\" for not buying enough US exports if he returned to the Oval Office. He said he would impose a 10 per cent tariff on imports from all countries, and 60 per cent duties on imports from China. \"The European Union must stand close together and act in a united manner,\" Mr Scholz said. Mr Macron said on X that Berlin and Paris would work for a united, stronger Europe within \"the new context\". European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Trump on his victory but said avoiding trade wars was in everyone's interest. \"Millions of jobs and billions in trade and investment on each side of the Atlantic depend on the dynamism and stability of our economic relationship,\" she said.

The veteran journalist also described Trump in that book as \"far worse than Richard Nixon\" — a man Woodward and Carl Berstein as Washington Post reporters famously exposed in the Watergate scandal, which would see Nixon resign from the presidency. Despite those comments, in the hours after Trump was announced president-elect, Woodward told 7.30 there are reasons for Americans to hope that Trump in his second term as president may grow into the role. \"People grow, even old men,\" Woodward told 7.30.  \"He has to know he has an opportunity to rise above himself in so many of his instincts and impulses, and if he does that, he could really do something.\" Legendary journalist Bob Woodward is cautiously optimistic about Trump's second presidency. (ABC News: Supplied) During his first presidency, COVID-19 hit and Trump's own comments on how to deal with the virus were contradicted by his Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci. Trump also withdrew America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, while he brokered meetings with strong men leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un. Trump's politics have at times been considered divisive but during the 2024 election he captured the popular vote for the first time in his three presidential races, sweeping the swing states. And if that many Americans believe in him then Woodward is willing to give the man who proudly declared pre-election — \"Kamala, you're fired\" — a chance. Kamala Harris delivering her concession speech. (Reuters: Hannah McKay) Questioned about his optimism about a president-elect who has been found guilty in a criminal trial and lost a civil litigation suit in the past year, Woodward said he hoped that the past few months may have changed Trump for the better. \"There are lots of barriers, his past and his behaviour but I think it's possible [he changes],\" Woodward said. \"There is a point in my book War. This summer after he's been shot … and he has that bandage over his ear, and he to the crowd, gave the following speech: \"The discord and division of our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a sheer distant destiny. We rise together, or we fall apart. I am running to be president of all Americans, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning only half America. \"He changed in that very speech and said some very dark things at the same time, but let's give him a chance.\" While Woodward is hoping for change, he does acknowledge it may be difficult. He has known Trump for years, when Trump was a New York businessman and real estate mogul, who Woodward says was guided by an instinct that has remained prevalent throughout his career. Donald Trump in the 1990s. Woodward has known him more than 30 years.\n\n\n  (Reuters: Joyce George) It has not always been well received. In 1989 he took out newspaper advertisements calling for New York State to implement the death penalty after the Central Park Five began to confess to the rape and assault of jogger Trisha Mieli, before they were convicted. They would years later have their convictions vacated. Trump said in 2019 he would not apologise for the ads. While Trump is sometimes controversial, his instincts have not just once but twice led him to the White House. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  They may have never been more spot on than the moments following his own near demise. When an assassin's bullet grazed his ear at a rally near Butler, Pennsylvania Trump — after being swarmed by Secret Service agents — rose, fist in the air, defiant and proclaimed \"fight, fight, fight\". It is a moment that will be etched in history. Woodward says Trump's belief in his instincts can be both a blessing and a curse. Bob Woodward is best known for his reporting on the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein. (Supplied: Lisa Berg) When he and Bernstein interviewed Trump more than 30 years ago Trump spoke of instinct and did the same during an Oval Office interview during his first term. \"He's got a lot to answer for,\" Woodward said. \"Is he going to know that, or is he going to think 'now I'm president, I've got all the power' and [will] laud it over people in a dangerous way? \"The office of president changes the person. How did it change Donald Trump, first time around?  \"To give him credit we had a pretty good economy and we had no war. That's a big deal for a country, for people who have to serve in the military but he also made lots of mistakes, and his character was revealed in ways that really foreshadow a danger for the country.\" The potential dangers of a Trump presidency could be felt wider than the United States. Ukraine is one country that has every reason to be nervous.  Trump has in the past suggested he could quickly end Russia's war and called Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"the greatest salesman on Earth\" for having solicited and received billions of dollars of US military aid. Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine is something Trump has said he could end. (Reuters: Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Kremlin) Woodward says that Trump \"likes\" Russian President Vladimir Putin but that the president-elect must consider what any ramifications of trying to broker a peace deal could be. Putin's goals for Russia outside of Ukraine remain unclear but Woodward says if Ukraine gave up any land it could set a dangerous precedent. \"Trump is going to [have to] listen to other people, and Ukraine is really important,\" Woodward said. \"If we are going to enter a world where a country like Russia can attack and territorially acquire another country, It's very interesting.  \"If Russia takes over Ukraine, then Ukraine has a 315 mile (506km) border with Poland.  \"I talked with the President of Poland (Andrzej) Duda, who is worried to death that Ukraine will fall to Russia and he reminds me, when I talk with him, that the last war, it came from the other side, Germany, and now it could come from Russia.\" Watch the full interview between Bob Woodward and 7.30's Sarah Ferguson on ABC TV and ABC iview.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Courts and Trials US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

By Heloise Vyas What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House.

An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research. You can read more on the way they have voted has changed from my colleagues Isabella Higgins and Elias Clure here: By Caitlin Rawling Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the post-Cold War order is crumbling. Brookings Institute's Andrew Yeo told News Channel Putin and other world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jingping, were wanting to establish a new order. \"They believe with Trump having been elected, Trump has not been a champion of alliances or multilateral institutions,\" he said. He said leaders like Putin were ready to fill that void and come up with some \"alternative order\". You can watch the full interview here: By Jessica Riga I've been monitoring AP like a hawk for any updates out of Arizona and Nevada, but they remain the last two states to be called. So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called. By Louise Miolin Frustration around the economy has been cited as one of the top issues that secured Donald Trump a second term in the White House. And while Trump's victory has sent markets soaring, there's now questions about what his policies could mean for both the US and global economy. Justin Wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan, and was among 400 economists who backed  Kamala Harris. He told NewsRadio's Thomas Oriti Americans might start buying more products ahead of Trump's expected tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"One of my dear friends, her mum just ordered a dishwasher yesterday — she thought the dishwasher could probably hold on through to some point in 2025, but she didn't want to pay 10 or 20 per cent more.\" Wolfers said if America raises tariffs on countries around the world, it could lead to a \"lot of damage\" through a trade war. \"One of the big policy questions for Australia is going to be: If the US does impose tariffs on every country, including Australia, should Australia retaliate?\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AP: Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Welcome back to your weekly update on US politics, where North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan catches you up on the biggest post-election developments. A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. I first met Holly Purcell ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. She and her husband Steven run a machine parts workshop in Hershey, Pennsylvania – the home of Hershey's chocolates. Holly had previously considered herself a lifelong Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She was no fan of Trump back then. \"I didn't like his personality,\" she told me. Holly and Stephen Purcell spoke to the ABC in Pennsylvania ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz) But by 2022, historically high inflation had pushed up the cost of running the Purcells' business. Stephen said it was the biggest issue the family-run company had faced since it was started in 1968. At the same time, he and Holly were grappling with rising prices at the supermarket. In the lead-up to the midterms, Holly made what she described as the \"tough decision\" to register as a Republican. At this election, she voted for Trump. \"I'm ecstatic,\" she said when we caught up after the results were called. \"I can't believe that Pennsylvania went red.\" Trump urged voters to punish Biden, and his vice-president, for the cost-of-living pressures that had already helped to evict other incumbent governments around the world. There's plenty of debate around whether his signature policies of tariffs on imports, and the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, will help or hinder the US economy. But for voters like Holly, Trump's approach to both economic and immigration issues — which was another major worry for her — come across as \"common sense\". \"I feel like I'm on the right side, if there has to be a side,\" she said. Concerns about immigration also influenced the political views of Brooklyn resident Brenda Lee. She'd voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past. But when we first spoke earlier this year for a Foreign Correspondent episode about border policy, she'd decided to back Trump. \"I'm hoping that he closes the border, like freeze on the border,\" she said at the time. \"Just until we get this in control.\" Brenda Lee has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past. (Foreign Correspondent: Cameron Schwarz) The number of people crossing into the US without authorisation had risen substantially under Biden's administration. Democratic-led cities like New York were struggling to cope with a surge of new arrivals, driven partly by a bussing program introduced by the Republican governor of Texas. Brenda had joined with other locals to protest the establishment of a large tent shelter on the outskirts of their neighbourhood. They were advertising an upcoming rally with posters that read: \"New Yorkers come first.\" Biden sought to toughen his stance on immigration, as Trump made the issue central to his campaign. Instead of handing control of the White House to a new generation of Democratic leaders, Joe Biden will now suffer the ignominy of watching Donald Trump once again take the reins of power. Both the president, and then Harris, blamed him for deliberately sinking bipartisan legislation aimed at addressing the situation. Ultimately though, Brenda feels like Democrats didn't do enough to address frustrations over both the border and the cost of living. \"People felt that others were being prioritised over Americans in their homeland,\" she said as she took the election outcome in. \"And that was kind of like a slap in the face to people when they were struggling.\" Trump didn't win New York at this election, as he'd claimed he could. But he improved his standing in a state that has long been considered very safe for Democrats. And there were significant swings towards him in other blue states, too. \"I think he's going to do right by the people,\" Brenda said. \"And hopefully we'll have a good four years, right?\" Holly and Brenda are just two of the millions of Americans who had their say at this election. Analysts will pore over the detailed reasons behind Trump's victory for years to come. There is already particular interest in how he built support among demographics that have traditionally leaned towards Democrats. This election Trump improved his standing in New York, a state that has long been considered very safe for Democrats. (AP: Evan Vucci) Latino voters in Arizona and Florida, for example, had told us they believed Trump better represented the values of most importance to their communities. Black Americans in Georgia said they were drawn to Trump's experience as a businessman. And a former self-described \"Democrat union guy\" in Pennsylvania argued Republicans now offered more to working-class people. But no single group of people in the US, or in Australia for that matter, is a monolith. So many of the Americans I've met over the past few years have had thoughtful, and often very personal, political views, driven largely by their own life experiences. And if Harris had won, I'd likely be reflecting on discussions we'd had with voters who cared deeply about abortion rights, or with women of colour who desperately wanted to see themselves reflected in the nation's highest office. What is clear at this point is that what had been tipped to be a very close election turned out to be a resounding victory for the man voted out of the White House only four years ago. Americans have spoken. They'll get another chance to do so in four years' time. Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dance outside the White House in Washington, DC.

Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research. You can read more on the way they have voted has changed from my colleagues Isabella Higgins and Elias Clure here: By Caitlin Rawling Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the post-Cold War order is crumbling. Brookings Institute's Andrew Yeo told News Channel Putin and other world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jingping, were wanting to establish a new order. \"They believe with Trump having been elected, Trump has not been a champion of alliances or multilateral institutions,\" he said. He said leaders like Putin were ready to fill that void and come up with some \"alternative order\". You can watch the full interview here: By Jessica Riga I've been monitoring AP like a hawk for any updates out of Arizona and Nevada, but they remain the last two states to be called. So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called. By Louise Miolin Frustration around the economy has been cited as one of the top issues that secured Donald Trump a second term in the White House. And while Trump's victory has sent markets soaring, there's now questions about what his policies could mean for both the US and global economy. Justin Wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan, and was among 400 economists who backed  Kamala Harris. He told NewsRadio's Thomas Oriti Americans might start buying more products ahead of Trump's expected tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"One of my dear friends, her mum just ordered a dishwasher yesterday — she thought the dishwasher could probably hold on through to some point in 2025, but she didn't want to pay 10 or 20 per cent more.\" Wolfers said if America raises tariffs on countries around the world, it could lead to a \"lot of damage\" through a trade war. \"One of the big policy questions for Australia is going to be: If the US does impose tariffs on every country, including Australia, should Australia retaliate?\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called.

By Heloise Vyas What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research.

(AP: Alex Brandon) Donald Trump's high-profile running mate, JD Vance, is anything but media shy. But his wife, Usha Vance, while often flanking him on the campaign trail, has said very little publicly. It's prompted some to describe her as a \"political enigma\" and a \"total mystery\". One op-ed suggested she wasn't \"following the script\" typically expected of a political spouse. She wears many hats — daughter of immigrants, Yale graduate, lawyer, wife and mother-of-three. Her husband's meteoric rise to the White House second-in-line comes at a time when Indian Americans are a growing political force. But her Indian roots have attracted racist backlash from the far-right, including from Trump's supporters. While Kamala Harris's ancestral village may have despaired at the US election result, some 900 kilometres away, another Indian village was celebrating the Trump team's win. The Indian Express reported \"euphoria\" in Usha Vance's ancestral village of Vadluru, in the southern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh, where locals distributed sweets and celebrated with crackers and prayers. Villagers at a temple in the village of Vadluru celebrate Trump's election win. (AFP: Idrees Mohammed) She was born Usha Bala Chilukuri to Indian scientists, who immigrated to the US shortly before she was born. She and Vance met at Yale Law school and have three children together: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. Academic excellence appears to run in the family; her father and grandfather both taught or studied at India's premier engineering college, and her sister is a mechanical engineer with a semiconductor company. Her 96-year-old great aunt — an expert in physics living in India — was recently celebrated in the Indian press as the country's oldest active professor. At the Republican National Conference earlier this year, she gave a rare speech on stage, in which she did not name Trump. She said she and JD Vance became friends first and described him as the most interesting person she knew. \"A working-class guy who had overcome childhood traumas that I could barely fathom, to end up at Yale law school,\" she said. She said he \"approached our differences with curiosity and enthusiasm\" — that he adapted to her vegetarian diet and learned to cook Indian food from her mother. The childhood home where JD Vance grew up in Middletown, Ohio.   (The Enquirer/USA Today Network: Sam Greene, via Reuters) In his book Hillbilly Elegy, Mr Vance described Ms Vance as \"super smart\" and listed her positive qualities — \"bright, hardworking, tall and beautiful\". He credits Ms Vance in the memoir for telling him what fork to use at an important dinner. A high-profile lawyer, she worked as a law clerk for judge Brett Kavanaugh prior to his nomination to the Supreme Court. Seven weeks after giving birth to her first child, she began a clerkship for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. She resigned from her law firm Munger Tolles in the middle of this year when Mr Vance became Trump's running mate. While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. \"For much of American history, the spouse of the vice-president of the United States did not maintain a prominent public role,\" an explainer on the White House Historical Association says. \"However, as the Office of Vice President has evolved over time to include more responsibilities, power, influence, and resources, the 'second spouse' has also grown in recognition and stature.\" As celebrations and commiserations followed the US election result, claims about election fraud germinated online, but this time it wasn't just from Trump supporters. Patricia Nixon expanded on the role during her husband Richard Nixon's terms as vice-president from 1953 to 1961, travelling and attending events independently and visiting hospitals, orphanages, and other local community organisations. In the late 1970s, funding was officially allocated to support the second spouse's activities in support of the vice-president and during the 1980s an office was established for the second spouse on the second floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the vice-president's. In recent years, second spouses have been known to advocate publicly on issues, serve on task forces and promote causes. According to a profile of Usha Vance in The Cut — a piece for which she declined to be interviewed — friends described her as well-liked, academically impressive, and said \"that her inner life was a black box\". The profile quoted an anonymous ex-friend about Ms Vance standing by Mr Vance as he transformed from a \"Never Trumper\" to Trump's running mate. Usha Vance remained relatively quiet during the US presidential campaign.\n\n  (Reuters: Megan Varner) \"Initially, I thought, 'Surely she can't be OK with this, and she's going to divorce him in time',\" the ex-friend told The Cut. \"Then I saw her at the Republican National Convention and thought, 'Could she actually be on board?'\" Ms Vance was once a registered Democrat, and the Daily Beast reported Mr Vance told a friend she planned to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. According to the New York Times, Ms Vance's parents were registered Democrats and her mother signed a letter from professors to Trump, calling on him to not withdraw from the Paris climate change accords. One acquaintance, legal writer David Lat, said the couple reminded him of Bill and Hillary Clinton. \"One thing that struck me as Hillary-esque was that Usha seemed to have more polish than JD,\" Lat said in The Cut. When Donald Trump first took office, JD Vance boldly declared he would never support him. So how did this conservative venture capitalist-turned-politician win over the former president to become his pick for Republican vice-president? In an interview with the New York Times, Mr Vance described how Ms Vance was raised a Hindu, but supported his conversion to Catholicism in 2019. \"She's got three kids,\" he said. \"Obviously I help with the kids, but because I'm kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church. \"And I just felt kind of bad. Like, oh, you didn't sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer. Are you OK with this? And she was more than OK with it.\" Ironically, Usha Vance appears to embody aspects at odds with some of Trump's supporters, who often espouse anti-immigrant and anti-elite rhetoric. She and her husband have been the subject of racist tweets throughout the campaign. One of the more overt examples came from Nick Fuentes, a political pundit and streamer who has aired white supremacist views. \"Who is this guy, really? Do we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and named their kid Vivek is going to support white identity?\" he said. \"This guy's going to defend American identity? \"How else could you countenance American identity if you have a mixed-up family like that?\" The election win was celebrated in India, but Usha Vance's heritage sparked racist commentary during the campaign. (AFP: Idrees Mohammed) In response, JD Vance told journalist Megyn Kelly: \"Obviously, she's not a white person, and we've been accused — attacked — by some white supremacists over that,\" he said. \"But I just — I love Usha. She's such a good mum, she's such a brilliant lawyer and I'm so proud of her.\" He later said if people wanted to criticise him, they should leave his wife out of it. \"If these guys want to attack me or attack my views, my policy views, my personality, come after me,\" he said. \"But don't attack my wife. She's out of your league.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:US Elections Immigration India Race Relations US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans.

Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised.

(James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions.

An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday.

The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research. You can read more on the way they have voted has changed from my colleagues Isabella Higgins and Elias Clure here: By Caitlin Rawling Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the post-Cold War order is crumbling. Brookings Institute's Andrew Yeo told News Channel Putin and other world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jingping, were wanting to establish a new order. \"They believe with Trump having been elected, Trump has not been a champion of alliances or multilateral institutions,\" he said. He said leaders like Putin were ready to fill that void and come up with some \"alternative order\". You can watch the full interview here: By Jessica Riga I've been monitoring AP like a hawk for any updates out of Arizona and Nevada, but they remain the last two states to be called. So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called. By Louise Miolin Frustration around the economy has been cited as one of the top issues that secured Donald Trump a second term in the White House. And while Trump's victory has sent markets soaring, there's now questions about what his policies could mean for both the US and global economy. Justin Wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan, and was among 400 economists who backed  Kamala Harris. He told NewsRadio's Thomas Oriti Americans might start buying more products ahead of Trump's expected tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"One of my dear friends, her mum just ordered a dishwasher yesterday — she thought the dishwasher could probably hold on through to some point in 2025, but she didn't want to pay 10 or 20 per cent more.\" Wolfers said if America raises tariffs on countries around the world, it could lead to a \"lot of damage\" through a trade war. \"One of the big policy questions for Australia is going to be: If the US does impose tariffs on every country, including Australia, should Australia retaliate?\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

He paid tribute to Kamala Harris and her \"inspiring campaign\", calling on Democrats not to give up hope. Trump's team continues working on transition plans with more appointments expected to be announced in coming days.  US President Joe Biden has called for Americans to \"bring down the temperature\" of political debate in his first speech since Donald Trump's comprehensive win in Tuesday's election. Mr Biden, who received a standing ovation in the White House Rose Garden from a crowd that included cabinet, staff and his granddaughter, paid tribute to his Vice-President Kamala Harris, who he said he spoke with yesterday. \"She's been a partner and a public servant. She ran an inspiring campaign, and everyone got to see something that I learned early on to respect so much — her character. She has a backbone like a ramrod,\" he said. He said \"a defeat does not mean we are defeated\" and the challenge for Democrats was to get back up again. He didn't reflect on his role in the election defeat. \"We accept the choice the country made. I've said many times you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbour only when you agree on something,\" he said. \"I hope we can, no matter who you voted for, see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans. Bring down the temperature.\" Instead of handing control of the White House to a new generation of Democratic leaders, Joe Biden will now suffer the ignominy of watching Donald Trump once again take the reins of power. Mr Biden made several remarks in the speech that recalled the way Donald Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20, \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". \"Yesterday, I spoke with president-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory, and I assured him that I direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition,\" he said. \"That's what the American people deserve.\" He also said he hoped America can rest the questions about the integrity of its electoral system. \"It is honest, it is fair and it is transparent and it can be trusted, win or lose. Also hope we can restore the respect for all our election workers who busted their necks and took risks at the outset, we should thank them.\" Joe Biden blew a kiss as he finished his first public remarks since his vice-president, Kamala Harris, lost the election. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz) Mr Biden said his had been a \"historic\" presidency \"for all Americans\" with work that will continue to be felt by Americans for the next 10 years. \"We're leaving behind the strongest economy in the world. I know people are still hurting, but things are changing rapidly. Together, we've changed America for the better,\" he said. But earlier in the day Donald Trump Jr, appearing on Fox and Friends, said the Democrats live in \"some sort of vacuum that they just don't understand\". US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  \"If you look at the failures, there's not a single metric where we're better off today than we were four years ago, economically, geopolitically or otherwise,\" he said. \"We went from a time of peace to a time of war. We went from a time of prosperity to a time of poverty, and everyone feels it.\" Donald Trump Jr is closely involved with his father's transition team. (Reuters: Jeenah Moon) Mr Trump Jr said he would be heavily involved with the transition, helping to pick his father's cabinet and the 4,000-odd government positions that are political appointees.  It is expected that some of those positions will start to be announced in the coming days. The transition is led by co-chairs Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, who is a former wrestling executive who served in Trump's first term, but a cast of Trump's family and friends is expected to be involved, including vice-president elect JD Vance. Trump said in his victory speech that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination and anti-fluoride activist Robert Kennedy Jr will be tapped to \"help make America healthy again\". Trump has also pledged to make his vocal supporter  Elon Musk a secretary of federal \"cost-cutting\". Senator Tom Cotton, who had previously been picked to be secretary of defence, has removed himself from consideration, Reuters reports. About 1,200 positions need Senate confirmation, which will obviously be easier now that Republicans hold the Senate. While Team Trump is busy building its future, Mr Biden remains in the White House with a job to do. \"Now we have 74 days to finish the term, our term, let's make every day count. That's the responsibility we have to the American people,\" he said. As he finished speaking, Mr Biden blew a kiss to the gathered crowd before retreating back into the White House to go back to work.  Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:US Elections US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election.

(Reuters:Carlos Barria) Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. While he won't be sworn in for a few months, the former (and future) president has a growing to-do list for a second term. Let's take a look at his policies and what shape they might take in practice. What are his policies? How will this look in practice? Cutting thousands of federal workers could risk weakening the government's ability to enforce statutes and rules. That's because it would reduce the number of employees engaging in such work and would potentially cause a chilling effect on those who remain. What are his policies? How will this look in practice? Trump has criticised the Biden administration's spending on cleaner energy measures. With his energy agenda anchored to fossil fuels, the president-elect is likely to abandon renewable energy targets. He argues the ramping up of fossil fuels will drive down constituents' energy bills. What are his policies? How might he achieve this?  With plans to eliminate the Department of Education, Trump plans to achieve his other policies by using federal funding for schools in a carrot-or-stick approach. Schools that comply with his policies would receive funding, while those that don't will have it pulled. He has also said he would tax, fine and sue \"excessively large private university endowments\" at schools that don't cooperate. What are his policies? How might this look in practice? While Trump's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not new — he's been talking about it since 2015. The president-elect still has not proposed a replacement but in his debate against Vice-President Kamala Harris in September, he insisted he had \"concepts of a plan\". And while Kennedy, a noted vaccine sceptic, has said, 'We're not gonna take vaccines away from anybody\", Trump himself has not ruled out vaccine bans. The president-elect says he would consult with Kennedy and others before making a call. Kennedy has flagged that he would advise fluoride be removed from public water systems despite health and dental experts maintaining its addition to drinking water is beneficial. The environmental lawyer has also said there are \"entire departments\" within the Food and Drug Administration that would \"have to go\", including its nutrition department. What are his policies? How might he achieve this?  Most rules around construction actually come from state and local governments, so his ability to cut regulations may be limited. What are his policies? How might he achieve this? The president-elect hasn't shared many details about how he plans to enact his deportation plan. He has floated the idea of deploying the National Guard and has suggested pulling funding for local law enforcement agencies that don't cooperate. Ending birth-right citizenship would almost certainly require a constitutional change, which is difficult to achieve. There are some tough hoops to jump through to make amendments, according to the White House website. \"An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the states request one, by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification.\" What are his policies? What are his policies? How will this look in practice? The president-elect's 'no tax on tips' policy appealed directly to low-income earners who work service roles. But depending on how the bill is written by Congress, it could also end up creating a back-door tax break for top wage earners. As Bill Barrow writes for the Associated Press, the bill could allow high-income earners to \"reclassify some of their pay as tip income\". What are his policies? How will this look in practice? Democrats say Trump's plan for tariffs on foreign goods will cost the average American family about $US4,000 ($6,043) a year. It really depends. In terms of passing federal laws, it will come down to how much power Republicans have in Congress. To pass legislation, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve the same bill by majority votes. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  So if Republicans have control of both levels of Congress, Trump would be able to push bills through rather quickly. So far, we know they've won the majority in the Senate but control over the House of Representatives still hangs in the balance. But if Democrats end up with control of the House, it'll take a fair bit of compromise to get legislation over the line. Of course, some of Trump's policies could encounter legal challenges. Statutes and administrative regulation can be subject to judicial reviews, which determine whether they violate or contradict the provisions of existing laws. Donald Trump will return to the White House, leaving allies like Australia — and rivals like China — wondering what might be coming next. And if a law is found to be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court has the authority to strike it down. Even so, it's likely this won't give Trump much trouble. There are nine justices on the Supreme Court at any given time and at the moment, six of them are conservative. Things there aren't likely to change any time soon, either. Supreme Court justices have a lifetime tenure, which means positions can only open up when one retires, dies, or is impeached. And when there is an opening, the president is in charge of nominating which judge is appointed. That means there's a chance in the next four years that Trump could actually extend the court's conservative majority. While US presidents do have some veto power, it doesn't allow them to amend or alter legislation.  As the National Archives explains, \"the president only has the ability to accept or reject an entire act passed by Congress\".  The president, can, however, influence how bills are written up by threatening to use their veto power.  It's also possible for the veto power to be overridden.  If a president uses their veto to knock back a bill, Congress can still pass the act if two-thirds of both the House and Senate approve.  That prevents the president from blocking legislation that has substantial popularity.  ABC/AP Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Government and Politics US Elections United States World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Crime Topic:Explainer Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor.

An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\".

As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence.

By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration.

It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election.

Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called.

By Heloise Vyas What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said.

(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, President-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him. \"Not permitted under law,\" Mr Powell told reporters at a press conference after the interest rate decision. When asked if he would step down if asked by the incoming president, he replied with a terse: \"No.\" With a contract due to run until May 2026, there appears to be plenty of opportunity for an eventual showdown between the pair. The independence of 'the Fed' is more than simple political convention. It operates with legal independence subject to the oversight of Congress and, until Trump, presidents for decades had shied away from any comments about its operations or decisions. Originally appointed by Trump in February 2018, the then president ignored the conventions, constantly sniping at Powell with a torrent of abuse on Twitter and in interviews, urging the central bank to cut interest rates. At one stage in 2019 he tweeted: \"My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\" Last month, he resuscitated that fight, arguing the president should have oversight over interest rate decisions, before firing off a series of personal barbs and openly mocking the Fed boss. \"I think it's the greatest job in government,\" Trump said. \"You show up at the office once a month and you say, 'Let's flip a coin', and everybody talks about you like you're a god.\" Later, in an effort to defuse tensions, he dismissed suggestions that he would try to remove the Fed chief but qualified it by adding \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing\". According to an unnamed senior Trump adviser who spoke to CNN immediately after Powell's defiant stance Thursday night, the president-elect will allow Powell to retain his job. While that assurance may allay immediate concerns about the independence of the world's biggest central bank, it may have been coloured by the rate cut announced just hours before, no doubt pleasing the incoming new president. While US shares hit fresh highs on the news of Donald Trump's election, sharp rises in the US 10-year bond rate could mean interest rate cuts are pushed further into the future. The US Federal Reserve has just begun cutting interest rates beginning with a double cut — 0.5 percentage points at its previous meeting — and this week's 0.25 percentage point cut. It is widely expected to continue that program in the new year. Powell was widely criticised back in 2019 for caving in to pressure from the then president by pumping liquidity into the system at a time when the US economy was starting to run hot. When the pandemic hit, the Fed found itself short of ammunition. A month ago, despite the pressure he had heaped upon Powell at the time, the president elect laid the blame on the Fed boss for cutting rates in 2019. Powell, clearly still smarting from the backlash over his capitulation to Trump five years ago, appears determined to enshrine the independence of the world's most powerful central bank and restore his reputation. Or be terminated for trying. Trump's tariff plans have garnered most attention since his re-election. But his stance on monetary policy could be every bit as damaging to the global economy as interest rate and currency moves can be enormously powerful weapons when it comes to international trade. Half a century ago, political strong men would boast about the strength of their national currency, claiming it as a measure of global respect. These days, it's the opposite. A weaker currency delivers instant extra competitiveness on the global stage. By artificially lowering interest rates, central banks can weaken the currency and gain an advantage over rivals. A weaker currency makes your exports more competitive and reduces the ability of domestic consumers to buy foreign goods. In the past, Trump has accused China of exactly that. Asian leaders now look on with trepidation about what a Trump presidency may mean for currencies and whether the incoming administration will add a currency war to its clear intentions to begin a trade war. As the global reserve currency, the US dollar dictates the price of all other currencies and commodities and US government debt, considered to be the world's safest and the benchmark for global interest rates, is the biggest foreign investment for many nations. Japan holds around $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) in US government bonds and China, despite selling down in recent years, retains around $US770 billion worth of US government debt. Stomping interest rates will reduce the value of those bonds and will have a serious impact on international balance sheets and the national wealth of the countries that own them. Despite the tepid assurances this week that he won't try to replace Powell, the incoming president has made no secret of the fact that he should have the ultimate say over interest rates. \"The Federal Reserve is a very interesting thing and it's sort of gotten it wrong a lot,\" Trump said in August. \"I feel the president should have at least say in there, yeah. I feel that strongly. I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money. I was very successful. And I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\" Jerome Powell clearly thinks otherwise.

Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research. You can read more on the way they have voted has changed from my colleagues Isabella Higgins and Elias Clure here: By Caitlin Rawling Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the post-Cold War order is crumbling. Brookings Institute's Andrew Yeo told News Channel Putin and other world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jingping, were wanting to establish a new order. \"They believe with Trump having been elected, Trump has not been a champion of alliances or multilateral institutions,\" he said. He said leaders like Putin were ready to fill that void and come up with some \"alternative order\". You can watch the full interview here: By Jessica Riga I've been monitoring AP like a hawk for any updates out of Arizona and Nevada, but they remain the last two states to be called. So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called. By Louise Miolin Frustration around the economy has been cited as one of the top issues that secured Donald Trump a second term in the White House. And while Trump's victory has sent markets soaring, there's now questions about what his policies could mean for both the US and global economy. Justin Wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan, and was among 400 economists who backed  Kamala Harris. He told NewsRadio's Thomas Oriti Americans might start buying more products ahead of Trump's expected tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"One of my dear friends, her mum just ordered a dishwasher yesterday — she thought the dishwasher could probably hold on through to some point in 2025, but she didn't want to pay 10 or 20 per cent more.\" Wolfers said if America raises tariffs on countries around the world, it could lead to a \"lot of damage\" through a trade war. \"One of the big policy questions for Australia is going to be: If the US does impose tariffs on every country, including Australia, should Australia retaliate?\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called.

Some highlights from the day: Before we forget, Arizona and Nevada have still not be called. The states are worth a combined 17 electoral votes and Trump is currently polling ahead in both. And finally, the House of Representatives election race remains ongoing. As of now, the Democrats have won 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218.

By Heloise Vyas What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor.

(ABC NEWS Verify: Devi Mallal) Former president Donald Trump has been declared the winner of the 2024 US election and Vice-President Kamala Harris has conceded, setting up the peaceful transition of the US presidency from Democratic hands to Republican early next year. As celebrations and commiserations continue, millions of Americans seem deeply unsettled by the result, with conspiracy theories taking flight online from both sides — some from predictable sources and others from newly enraged voices. Mathew Marques is a senior lecturer in psychology at La Trobe University and says he is not surprised to see these kinds of ideas and narratives start to fester. \"Conspiracy theories are appealing ways to explain events and outcomes. Political science probably has the best quote on this — that conspiracy theories are for the losers. \"Post-elections and these sorts of things, conspiracy theories seem to be a nice way for people to make sense of what's happened to them.\" ABC NEWS Verify has been looking at some of the false and misleading narratives emerging rapidly online as the world absorbs the election result. Confusion about popular vote totals has given partisan accounts ammunition to sow doubt about the election result, with posts questioning the difference between the number of votes cast in 2020 and 2024. A false claim of voter fraud, this time from a supporter of the Democrats. (Supplied) As the idea took hold on X, users began to blame Trump and demand that Harris not concede. Many posts like these, containing false information and with millions of views, could be found on X after the race was called. (Supplied) There's a very simple explanation though: vote totals at the time these posts were published were much lower than 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden received over 81 million votes and then-president Trump received over 74 million. But that is simply because there was a large portion of the vote still uncounted. A large portion of the votes yet to be counted are in the west-coast states of California, Washington and Oregon, which have already been claimed for Harris. In most of the swing states Harris would need to have flipped to claim the presidency, the Associated Press estimates upwards of 98 per cent of the vote has already been counted. As the AP has called Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia for the Republican nominee, these results are highly unlikely to change. Dr Marques's research is in the causes and consequences of conspiracy belief structures. He told ABC NEWS Verify that some people would be attempting to come up with explanations as they grappled with the result. \"People who found the election results unexpected or against what they were hoping for, some may entertain conspiracy theories as a way of understanding what's happening.\" Crestfallen Harris supporters were not the only ones using the incomplete 2024 data to infer election fraud. A counterclaim has also emerged from Trump-supporting accounts questioning the validity of Biden's 2020 election count, even though dozens of lawsuits at the time turned up no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Trump supporters used the preliminary results to make false claims about the 2020 election. (Supplied) There was evidence of Russian influence operations during the election, but there's no evidence it changed the outcome. (Reuters: Alexei Nikolskyi/Sputnik) There's emerging evidence some Russian-linked interference did take place in the lead-up to and on election day, however, at this point it appears to have had little impact on the ultimate outcome given Trump's significant overall lead. On the eve of the election, CNN published allegations that Simeon Boikov, a registered Russian foreign agent holed up in the Russian consulate in Sydney, made payments to a US pro-Trump social media influencer to post a fake video of Haitian immigrants claiming to have voted multiple times for Kamala Harris on X. Speaking to news.com.au, Boikov described CNN's story as a \"nothing burger,\" but it follows the US Department of Justice in September charging two Russian media executives with funnelling payments to conservative influencers to create content favourable to the Russian regime. Although findings that Russian-linked entities made payments to right-wing influencers to spread disinformation are concerning, there's as yet no evidence that links this to the widespread swings towards Trump at the ballot. US Election live updates: Follow our blog for the latest news.  Left-wing commentators and social media users have also latched into the FBI's announcements that it was aware of several videos claiming to be from the FBI that were spreading falsehoods about the election including claims about malfunctioning voting machines. The videos and others that pretended to be from news organisations were tracked by BBC Verify, who described them as receiving little attention. The fake clips were ultimately seen \"tens of thousands of times\" by accounts that had \"few followers\" and the accounts spreading the videos on X have since been suspended. There's currently little evidence of any significant impact on Trump's election victory and, as Olga Robinson of BBC Verify points out, overstating their actual impact risks sending a signal to the Kremlin propagandists to pump out more like them. On election day, polling sites in several states were targeted by hoax bomb threats that according to the FBI appeared to originate from Russian email domains. The threats reportedly targeted voting locations across the country, including polling stations in battleground states including Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia. The threats led to the evacuation and brief closure of some polling stations such as two targeted locations in Georgia's Fulton County that were closed for under an hour before voting resumed, according to Reuters. It is unclear whether the bomb hoaxes were directed by the Kremlin, with the FBI merely describing many of the threats as apparently originating from \"Russian email domains\", which could have been Russian citizens rather than the government itself. What these examples have all done is fuel speculation about Russia's ability to \"rig\" the election in Trump's favour. Several political commentators, including former MSNBC pundit Keith Olbermann, have described the act as \"terrorism\" and \"an act of war\" by Russia. While in time, evidence may surface that proves the Russian regime directed the bomb threats and other interference, at this stage that evidence hasn't yet come to light and the disruptions themselves appear to have had little impact on the election outcome. Through this campaign, Trump's thoroughly and comprehensively disproven claims of a \"stolen\" 2020 election were constantly repeated, and he spent huge amounts of time and effort setting up his supporter base to expect Democrats to \"steal\" this election too. Early in the vote count, Trump took to his preferred social media platform Truth Social to allege without evidence that \"massive CHEATING\" was taking place in Philadelphia — a claim that was immediately called out and debunked by the city's district attorney, Larry Krasner. On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump made false allegations of voter fraud during the count. (Donald Trump) As results came through in his favour, the posts from Mr Trump claiming election fraud dried up. However, many of his supporters, primed to expect a conspiracy, seemed almost confused with the result online. A long-ingrained false narrative of Democrats' nefarious intent confused some Trump supporters when the race was called for him. (Supplied) \"People's beliefs are resistant to change,\" said La Trobe University's Dr Marques. \"If you believe that UFOs are coming to take you away, or you believe that the election was stolen or was going to be stolen, then sharing those beliefs or having others around you who believe the same sorts of things are probably fairly important in terms of continuing that belief,\" he said. Right-wing conspiracy theories pushing people to start preparing for the election to be \"stolen\" in 2028 are already starting to do the rounds. Dr Marques said these constructed narratives will remain attractive for people with eroded trust in democracy and institutions. \"Conspiracy theories allege that there are powerful groups working in secret, doing something malevolent against an unsuspecting public. So the fact that they're fairly widespread, and also I think the fact that they're being expressed by people who are in authoritative positions or leadership positions, make them more salient and more available. And so they become more normative.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Crime Social Media US Elections United States Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(AAP: Mick Tsikas) Kevin Rudd looks set to stay on as ambassador to the United States — at least for now — with the government standing firmly by the former prime minister and the opposition declaring it \"hopes\" he can succeed with Donald Trump in the White House. It comes as the federal government grapples with a host of uncertainties about Trump's legislative agenda that could have deep implications for Australia's national security, economy and climate policies when he takes office once again in January. Mr Rudd's position came under fresh scrutiny on Thursday after he deleted several years-old social media posts fiercely criticising Trump, including calling him a \"traitor to the West\" and the \"most destructive president in history.\" His office said he made the comments \"in his previous role as the head of an independent US-based think tank\" and they were deleted \"to eliminate the possibility of such comments being misconstrued as reflecting his positions as ambassador and, by extension, the views of the Australian government.\" Kevin Rudd deleting tweets in the wake of Donald Trump's victory has given politicians a pertinent reminder: Making sharp comments can often feel good in the moment, but they don't come without consequences. Still, both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have declared full confidence in Mr Rudd and say they have no plans to move him on. Some government officials have also praised the ambassador in private, saying he has assiduously courted power players on both sides of the aisle in Washington. They've also pointed out that Trump has been willing to work with close aides who have previously denounced him — including his vice-president-elect, JD Vance. Senator Wong called Trump a \"pretty robust individual\" and declared Mr Rudd had been an \"outstanding ambassador and I'm confident will continue to be so\". \"One of the hallmarks of his tenure-ship thus far has been his delivery of reforms and changes with the support of both Republicans and Democrats and his ability to work with both sides of the aisle in Washington,\" she said. The opposition has mocked Mr Rudd over his posts, with the opposition leader suggesting the \"indefatigable\" former prime minister would now be \"buying red ties [and] MAGA hats\" to \"ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign\". But the Coalition has not called for him to be recalled. Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham told the ABC that he \"hoped\" Mr Rudd would \"be as effective as he has been to date\". However, he also warned that the government would have to make a \"clear-eyed assessment\" in \"coming months\" on whether the ambassador would be able to continue in the role. \"Kevin Rudd is not bigger than Australia's interests, nor is Anthony Albanese's personal commitment to Kevin Rudd,\" he said. In March, Donald Trump called Mr Rudd \"a little bit nasty\" and \"not the brightest bulb\" after British politician Nigel Farage recited some of the former prime minister's criticisms during a TV interview. Donald Trump was asked about Kevin Rudd during an interview with Nigel Farage. (X: GB News) But it's not clear whether Trump knew who Mr Rudd was during the exchange, with the president-elect also saying \"I don't know much about him.\" It's not just Mr Rudd who could be haunted by past comments: the government is also keenly conscious of the video that emerged on the weekend showing Anthony Albanese declaring in 2017 that Trump \"scared the shit\" out of him. The uncertainty around Trump's attitude towards Mr Rudd and Mr Albanese is mirrored by a broader uncertainty about what the returned president's domestic and international agenda will mean for the nation and the government's legislative agenda. The government is cautiously confident that Trump is unlikely to tear up the AUKUS agreement that is the foundation of Australia's ambitions to purchase up to five US Virginia-class submarines from the US, before building its own nuclear-powered submarines. Foreign Minister Penny Wong has also indicated that former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and others in Trump's inner circle back the plan and see it as an important part of US strategy in the region. Penny Wong has indicated some in Trump's inner circle are supportive of AUKUS. (ABC News: Marcus Stimson) One federal government source told the ABC that while there were \"never any guarantees\" with Trump, they were confident that the president would see the logic behind AUKUS. The government is much less certain about the implications of Trump 2.0 for the Australian economy and its key climate priorities. The government is hoping it might be able to dodge any direct tariffs from Trump, just as Malcolm Turnbull managed to convince the president to exempt Australia from steel tariffs back in 2018. But it may be much harder to duck the impacts of Trump's broader economic agenda. If Trump pushes ahead with his plan, it could hit Australia's economy by supercharging inflation. If he hits China with much larger tariffs — as he has threatened to do — that could spark a major trade war that could leave the global (and Australian) economy reeling. But the government is also keenly aware that it all depends on Trump's decision-making impulses, which remain deeply unclear — a frustrating reality that economic forecasters and policymakers here will have to grapple with (once again) from early next year. \"There's so many unknowns here. [Trump] said he will do these things. We don't know,\" Reserve Bank Bank governor Michele Bullock told Senate estimates on Thursday. \"It might not imply a hell of a lot for us.\" The government is also worried that Donald Trump's well-known climate denialism and hostility to renewable energy sources could also derail the energy transition in the US and slow it globally — putting pressure on Australia to unveil a less ambitious 2035 target. But congressional Republican support for the Biden administration's massive renewable energy subsidies — and the projects they support in their districts — may make it hard for Mr Trump to wind back the Inflation Reduction Act in the US. The federal government source speaking to the ABC said clean energy advocates would be able to make a powerful argument to Trump about the sheer economic force and logic of the global transition — along with its consequences for economic security. They also stressed there was no chance Australia would follow Trump's lead if he pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, as he has promised to do. Foreign Minister Penny Wong was keen to hammer the same theme when she stressed the \"economic imperative\" of the transition — for both Australia and the world. \"Climate hasn't gone away,\" she said. \"You know, just as in 2017 Australia stayed the course, we'll stay the course. \"We want an economy that can thrive not just in this world, but in a world which is moving to net zero. And so many major economies are doing that. We want to be competitive in that world, and that means transitioning our economy, and that's what the government's doing.\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Analysis by Brett Worthington Topic:Government and Politics Australia Federal Government Foreign Affairs Government and Politics US Elections Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House.

An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research. You can read more on the way they have voted has changed from my colleagues Isabella Higgins and Elias Clure here: By Caitlin Rawling Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the post-Cold War order is crumbling. Brookings Institute's Andrew Yeo told News Channel Putin and other world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jingping, were wanting to establish a new order. \"They believe with Trump having been elected, Trump has not been a champion of alliances or multilateral institutions,\" he said. He said leaders like Putin were ready to fill that void and come up with some \"alternative order\". You can watch the full interview here: By Jessica Riga I've been monitoring AP like a hawk for any updates out of Arizona and Nevada, but they remain the last two states to be called. So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called. By Louise Miolin Frustration around the economy has been cited as one of the top issues that secured Donald Trump a second term in the White House. And while Trump's victory has sent markets soaring, there's now questions about what his policies could mean for both the US and global economy. Justin Wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan, and was among 400 economists who backed  Kamala Harris. He told NewsRadio's Thomas Oriti Americans might start buying more products ahead of Trump's expected tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"One of my dear friends, her mum just ordered a dishwasher yesterday — she thought the dishwasher could probably hold on through to some point in 2025, but she didn't want to pay 10 or 20 per cent more.\" Wolfers said if America raises tariffs on countries around the world, it could lead to a \"lot of damage\" through a trade war. \"One of the big policy questions for Australia is going to be: If the US does impose tariffs on every country, including Australia, should Australia retaliate?\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency. By Conor Duffy A former Republican staffer funded by the Heritage Foundation has drawn up a list of \"top targets\" for the incoming Trump administration to purge from the public service. The American Accountability Foundation list has identified key targets at the Department of Homeland Security identified as woke or otherwise hostile to Donald Trump's immigration plans. Following research based on social media activity or comments at public events the list includes pictures and biographies of 51 policy experts most of whom are career public servants. Employees and unions have likened the site to Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous anti-communist crusades in the 1950s. The former Republican staffer behind the site defended the work and said he aimed to expose public servants with \"long standing and deep bias\" on immigration. It comes as Donald Trump prepares an executive order that would allow him to replace a portion of the 2.2 million career public servants with political loyalists. It also remains to be seen whether President Trump will order staff to return to the office from remote work or relocate them to cities outside Washington DC. The push to return to the office is opposed by unions but supported by DC's democratic Mayor. By Caitlin Rawling Many Latino and Hispanic voters swung from Democratic to Republican, by voting for Trump in this year's election. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research.

He said leaders like Putin were ready to fill that void and come up with some \"alternative order\". You can watch the full interview here: By Jessica Riga I've been monitoring AP like a hawk for any updates out of Arizona and Nevada, but they remain the last two states to be called. So why are they taking their sweet time? Well, in Arizona, most voters cast ballots by mail, and poll workers must wait until polls close to process the ballots that arrive on election day. Plus, this year officials are now required to count and report the number of ballots dropped off on election day before beginning to process them, so that's an added step. On top of that, in Maricopa (the state's largest county) there are so many contests that the ballot is two pages, so more paper to process. Nevada also, usually, takes awhile to be called. Postmarked ballots are allowed to arrive up to four days after the election and voters have until November 12 to address mistakes. So, long story short, it could take days for Arizona and Nevada to be called. By Louise Miolin Frustration around the economy has been cited as one of the top issues that secured Donald Trump a second term in the White House. And while Trump's victory has sent markets soaring, there's now questions about what his policies could mean for both the US and global economy. Justin Wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan, and was among 400 economists who backed  Kamala Harris. He told NewsRadio's Thomas Oriti Americans might start buying more products ahead of Trump's expected tariffs on goods brought into the US. \"One of my dear friends, her mum just ordered a dishwasher yesterday — she thought the dishwasher could probably hold on through to some point in 2025, but she didn't want to pay 10 or 20 per cent more.\" Wolfers said if America raises tariffs on countries around the world, it could lead to a \"lot of damage\" through a trade war. \"One of the big policy questions for Australia is going to be: If the US does impose tariffs on every country, including Australia, should Australia retaliate?\" Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(ABC News: Matt Roberts) This election, Adriana Zapata noticed something different.  The second-generation Mexican-American saw family, friends and loyal customers at her restaurant in downtown Phoenix, Arizona switching their political allegiances. Their new candidate? Donald Trump. \"It did really surprise me … now I can see how some of his messages on immigration started to cut through even though that's not how I vote,\" she said. The president-elect won 46 per cent of the Latino and Hispanic voter share, up 14 per cent on his 2020 election result, according to an exit poll from Edison Research. Among Latino men his gains were even higher, with Trump securing 55 per cent nationwide, up 19 percentage points on the 2020 exit poll from when the Republican candidate was defeated in the presidential race by Joe Biden. It is a figure that is shocking to Democrats who have long relied on the Latinos among their base. Back in 2012, for instance, Barack Obama secured 71 per cent of the vote. While vote counting in Arizona is continuing, Trump was on course for victory over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. \"We are not homogenous and that is something political leaders have not understood for too long,\" said Monica Ramirez, a Latino campaigner and activist. \"We as a community we have different interests, we have different histories, we have different immigration backgrounds, and political parties have treated us like we are the same,\" she said. \"Political leaders and parties need to take a better look at who Latinos are in this country and understand our differences to be able to engage all of us. \"We have such different lived experiences, different immigration contexts, different histories we bring from our home countries … some of us have been here in the US for much longer.\" Adriana Zapata hosted Vice-President Kamala Harris in her restaurant during the campaign. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Adriana was raised in Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico. About a third of the population here identify as Latino or Hispanic. \"Our parents and grandparents came to this country with the dream of starting businesses, to better themselves, now we are the ones who live the American dream,\" she said. Many within her community have family living in central and southern America, but there is still a desire for tough border restrictions, she said. \"People who have gained citizenship or a right to be in the country legally, they know the struggle they went through to get there, they feel kind of cheated by someone skipping all those steps.\" Tony Anders, 58, is one of her lunchtime regulars at her Mexican restaurant. He is also a second-generation American and a proud Trump supporter. \"My mum came from Panama but she did it the proper way, she learnt English, and now she loves America … that's how you have to do it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump is going to close the floodgates, send them back, you know come to our country, we will welcome people in but only if they do it the right way.\" Adriana supported Harris, even hosting the Democrat at her restaurant during a campaign stop in August. \"It was such an elated moment … I was so excited for a female president but I'm now accepting the new reality.\" While counting continues in Arizona, the state appears set to turn red. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Another of Adriana's customers is 62-year-old Mexican-American, Bob John, who found Trump's comments about mass deportations of immigrations extremely worrying. Comments made by a comedian at one of Trump's campaign events where Puerto Rico was described as a \"floating island of garbage\", deeply offended him. \"A lot of Latino men have come here to establish a better life and seem to have forgotten their roots,\" he said. \"I was voting for my grandchildren, I want them to have the life and lifestyle we've known here in the United States, being free and Democratic … I'm scared for the future now.\" Days before the election at one of Trump's final campaign events in Arizona, Chris Sanchez proudly brandished his \"Latinos for Trump\" sign. \"I don't care that he's racist, you know I think he's not actually racist … but at the end of the day my life was better under Trump, my 40-hour week pay stretched further,\" he said. \"For me and a lot of Latinos this is just about the economy.\" Chris Sanchez shows off his support for Donald Trump in Phoenix this week. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) In other states with large Latino communities like Texas and Florida, there was a significant shift towards the right from Hispanic voters. In Starr County, a Texas border region with a majority Latino population, Donald Trump ended a more than 100-year-hold of the Democrats, flipping the county red. \"I think the lesson here is that the primary identity of Americans is American,\" Republican Florida senator Marco Rubio, told NBC's the Today Show after the election. \"[Trump's] primary message was, 'I'm going to put the interests of Americans and America before anything else,' I think that's a message that's resonated. \"Whether you're of Hispanic descent or African-American or of any background, the price of gas, the price of food, the fear of uncertainty and not being safe in your own community ... people want what's best for them.\" Phoenix, Arizona, is home to a large Latino and Hispanic community. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Monica says there's a lot that could be learnt from the campaign, and believes the Democrats will need to work on their outreach and strategy particularly with men. \"Our men tend to lean more conservative, one of the main issues in our community has been economy and immigration, and Latino men particularly,\" she said. \"There is a lot of education needs to be done in our community for them to understand the reality of new immigrants and the state of our economy.\" It's not just some Hispanic and Latino voters shifting away from the Democrats. Young voters and Black men - two of the party's core demographics - also appear to be turning to Trump. Harris won the vote among 18-29-year-olds with 53 per cent, but Donald Trump improved 7 percentage points on his 2020 Edison exit poll. The Christian 180 Church in Detroit, Michigan, has been the scene of some pro-Trump sermons. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) On the outskirts of Detroit, Michigan, Lorenzo Sewell lead a prayer for the new president after the results became clear. The controversial pastor has hosted the president-elect in his Christian 180 Church and has encouraged congregation members, who are mostly black, to vote for him. His support for Trump is an outlier in the Motor City, where traditionally, about 90 per cent of the Black population votes Democrat. Trump flipped the state at Tuesday's election. One of the reasons behind his victory was increasing his share of the vote in deep-blue Detroit. \"Politics is math and when it comes down to the math of politics the Democrats know they cannot lose their most loyal voting — what's their most loyal voting bloc? Black people. Black people have voted blindly Democrats since the 60s,\" Sewell said. Lorenzo Sewell told his congregation to vote for Donald Trump. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) Exit polling from the presidential election revealed Trump gained ground among Black voters, particularly Black men. Sewell said Democratic politicians have spent decades courting Black voters but have failed to deliver any meaningful change to the communities who elected them. He believes it's led many Black voters to cast their ballot for a Republican candidate for the first time. \"They don't care about us. They don't know what it means to live on this side of Detroit. They have no idea what it means to live here,\" he said. Rick Wilcoxon, another member of Sewell's church, argued Democrats had become out of touch with the Black community. Still, he was the only member of his family to vote for Donald Trump. \"My ethnicity has been voting for Democrat for 40 years and every blue state you could imagine is crime-ridden, the poverty rate is high and heavy taxation and just pure chaos,\" he said. \"Yet they sell us on the fact that they are better for us than the Republicans. Black Lives don't matter to them, Black votes matter to them.\" Trump's political and real estate career has been plagued by allegations of racism. During the presidential campaign, Trump said illegal immigrants were taking \"Black jobs\". The comment was widely derided and was seen as a potential election-losing moment for the Republican nominee. Ramone Jackson does not feel like the Democrats have his best interests at heart. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) But Ramone Jackson, who not only voted for Trump this time but also when he won the presidency in 2016, said the comment resonated with him. \"We understand the concept of what he was saying, he was saying that it's certain jobs that certain people take,\" he said. \"Immigrants, being able to influx into our community doesn't help us at all, at all.\" Republican officials have told the ABC Trump's strategy to win Michigan revolved around to broadening his appeal to Black voters and Arab-Americans. Pete Hoekstra, the Chairman of the GOP in Michigan said the strategy was helped by community leaders reaching out to the party. \"It was certainly our plan, but community leaders have come to us saying they are frustrated with the leadership of the Democrats so it was about working with them,\" he said.

I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,\" Trump said. President Joe Biden has also spoken for the first time after Trump's historic re-election earlier this week. Look back at how the day's developments unfolded. By Heloise Vyas That's it for today's live coverage of the follow-on from the US presidential election. Some highlights from the day: Before we forget, Arizona and Nevada have still not be called. The states are worth a combined 17 electoral votes and Trump is currently polling ahead in both. And finally, the House of Representatives election race remains ongoing. As of now, the Democrats have won 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218.

By Heloise Vyas What is this project 2025 that the republicans are talking about - Chris It's a conservative blueprint set out for the incoming Republican administration by think tank The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, the organisation's director Paul Dans spoke to Four Corners detailing what its \"battle plan\" entails. One aspect relates to Donald Trump being equipped with what's been called an \"army\" of 10,000 people to help execute his political agenda. I'll leave the rest of the explaining to this piece by Mark Willacy and Amy Donaldson: By Heloise Vyas Americans' interest in moving abroad shot up as the prospects of a Donald Trump victory grew on Tuesday night, Reuters reported, based on online analytics. Google searches for \"move to Canada\" surged 1,270 per cent in the 24 hours after US East Coast polls closed, company data showed. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000 per cent while those for Australia jumped 820 per cent. Late Wednesday evening, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official. The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new US users on November 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year. The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the US, called \"r/AmerExit\", hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election. Reporting with Reuters By Heloise Vyas Could a “convicted felon” be validly elected to Federal Parliament or appointed to become Governor-General here? Does it matter if they were a very naughty boy/girl overseas or within an Australian state or territory? - Michelle You're not alone in wondering, Michelle. Trump's status as the only convicted felon to have ever won a presidential election, that too in the most powerful country in the world, has been what anyone can talk about. And he still faces a raft of other legal battles. More on that here. How someone with a record was eligible to run for political office? It's because the US constitution doesn't have any prohibitions on a presidential candidate with a criminal history — indicted, convicted or having served time. In Australia however, the law explicitly states: Anyone with a criminal conviction carrying a jail term of one year or more and cannot be elected to parliament, under section 44(2) of the constitution. By Heloise Vyas Israeli residents of \"Trump Heights\" are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the US presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognise Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialised after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \"Ramat Trump\" in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more than year-long war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. \"Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\" said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. \"President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\" he said. Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognised. Reporting by AP By Heloise Vyas All those who ascend to the highest political echelons of the United States generally do so hand-in-hand with their spouses. (James Buchanan was the US's only unmarried president and Charles Curtis the only bachelor vice-president). Of course President-elect Donald Trump's wife Melania needs no introduction and is a public personality in her own right. The former (and soon-to-be) first lady had made few public appearances since her husband announced he would run for president a third time, but came out more prominently promoting the release of her memoir in the back end of the campaign. But what about the \"second spouse\"? While the role of the vice-president's partner is not paid or formally defined, they have traditionally been expected to perform hosting and society functions. This time that role will be filled by Usha Vance, wife of Donald Trump's high-profile running mate JD Vance. Read more on her background here: By Heloise Vyas Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House, the Financial Times is reporting. Mr Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The 43-year-old is married to the president-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Both served as senior advisors in the last Trump administration from 2017 to 2020. By Heloise Vyas Barely a day after declaring victory in the US election, president-elect Donald Trump is facing his first revolt from the establishment. The world's most powerful central banker has thrown down the gauntlet at the soon-to-be world's most powerful leader, in a struggle between dominance and independence that could define the future of Trump's second tour of the White House. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after delivering Trump's yet to be formed administration a gift in the form of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, declared he was sticking around to serve out his term and the president-elect could not remove him Read the full piece from our chief business correspondent Ian Verrender: By Heloise Vyas A decisive victory. An unprecedented comeback. However you describe it, Donald Trump's election win will go down as a truly extraordinary moment in United States politics, writes our North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. There are plenty of questions being asked about how it went so wrong for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Was her incredibly short run at the White House doomed to fail from the moment Joe Biden quit so late in the race? Would she have been her party's first choice, had there been an open primary? Whatever the weaknesses of the vice-president's campaign, Trump's success was remarkable. And as we try to understand exactly how he achieved it, conversations with two American voters sprung to mind. By Louise Miolin You'll often hear American accents on the streets of Alice Springs, in the middle of the Australian desert. Census data shows the town's home to the highest number of Americans per capita in Australia.  In the suburb of Desert Springs, one in ten residents are American, that's because of the joint military base, Pine Gap. Most base workers won't talk US politics, but other Americans in town will. Nicholas \"Roadie\" Miller told the ABC's Alex Barwick it was \"quite hard\" to cast his vote from the other side of the world, but he did it – for independent Jill Stein. Another local, Jordan Braver, voted for Kamala Harris and was devastated seeing his home state Pennsylvania turn red. \"I feel very disappointed, I feel sad.\" \"It makes me concerned that a convicted felon is OK to be president.\" You can listen to Roadie and Jordan here: By Heloise Vyas Are there any restrictions on who can be appointed to the presidents cabinet or the executive office?  - Michael Great question, Michael. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is overseen by the chief of staff and consists of many of the president's closest advisors. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisors, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full presidential discretion, says the White House website. Same with the Cabinet. There are 26 members, all but two of whom (the VP and chief of staff) require Senate confirmation. The overall federal administration has about 4,000 presidential appointees on the government payroll as public sector staff. Generally speaking appointments requiring the approval of the Senate are senior leadership positions in the US government. By Audrey Courty Dr Christopher Borick, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Thomas Oriti on ABC NewsRadio that the derogatory comments made at a Donald Trump rally by a comedian about Puerto Ricans had minimal impact in the end.  \"Looking at the performance in those heavily Latino cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Lancaster, Reading, Trump actually gained from last time. \"Then you combine that with some exit polling data that says when you look at Latino voters, where they end up this year compared to 2020, I think the takeaway that you have is that probably those comments didn't have the impact Democrats thought they would.\" Dr Borick also said the class and education divide transcended race in the electorate. \"Race often matters in American politics, and among Black voters it didn't have as big of effect… but among Latino and Hispanic voters it's even more pronounced. \"And that's part of this realignment that's based not only on race, but also on education, class that that we're seeing a lot of movement in in American life.\" By Heloise Vyas Earlier today, President Joe Biden made his first remarks since his opponent-turned-successor Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. Mr Biden made several recollections to the way Trump left office in 2021, vowing that on January 20 (inauguration day), \"we'll have a peaceful transfer of power\". He also commended the way his deputy, Kamala Harris, ran her presidential campaign. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod.\" Read more on his speech in this story out of our Washington bureau: By Heloise Vyas We're yet to find out which party will take control of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats currently have 199 seats and the Republicans 211. A majority requires 218 seats to be won. The Republicans won control of the US Senate early on Wednesday. The Associated Press says it could be days until we know who wins the majority in the House of Reps. By Heloise Vyas For those asking, the position is the highest rank in the Executive Office of the United States president. The chief of staff is the top political appointee in the White House, meaning they are neither elected nor require confirmation of the Senate. They are a member of the president's cabinet, which also includes the vice-president, the heads of 15 executive departments, representatives from parliamentary departments, and diplomats. \"The cabinet’s role is to advise the president on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office,\" the White House website says. As gatekeeper to the president, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the president's time and schedule, maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers, and advises the president on policy matters. Joe Biden's chief of staff is Jeff Zients. He'll be succeeded by Susie Wiles when Donald Trump returns to the presidency.

President-elect Donald Trump won the state of Nevada on Saturday, according to the Associated Press, returning the state and its six electoral votes to Republicans for the first time since president George W Bush carried it in 2004.

Trump and Democratic candidate Vice-President Kamala Harris each made multiple campaign stops in the state this year.  Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris during her concession speech. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) The win pushes Trump's electoral vote tally over 300, with the race now sitting at 301 votes for Trump to 226 for Ms Harris. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner in Nevada at 9:15pm local time (4:15pm AEDT).  AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can't close the gap and overtake the vote leader. Trump has now won six out of the seven battleground states so far. Only Arizona, with its 11 Electoral College votes, is yet to be decided. Trump currently leads Ms Harris by 6.4 points in Arizona. AP estimates elections officials have counted about 82 per cent of the vote so far, which means Harris would need to beat Trump by about 28 points in the ballots left to be counted to catch up and take the lead. Joe Biden managed to win Arizona in 2020, beating Trump to become the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.  In the 2016 election, Trump beat Hilary Clinton and won Arizona. The other key swing states in this year's US election were Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump clinched a second term on Wednesday when Wisconsin pushed him past the 270 electoral votes needed to win, so Nevada's six electoral votes only added to the size of his victory. On Friday, Trump announced his campaign lead Susie Wiles as his incoming chief of staff. Elon Musk stands with Donald Trump during a campaign rally. ( REUTERS/Brian Snyder) Ms Wiles, who is a veteran Florida political strategist, will move into the high-profile position as one of Trump's key members in his political inner circle. This will make her the first woman to ever step into the important role at the White House, tasked with bringing order to the next administration. Donald Trump has appointed his campaign lead Susie Wiles as his next chief of staff. This is what we know about Ms Wiles. The president-elect has received several phone calls from world leaders to congratulate him on his victory since Wednesday.  Among those was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who reportedly spoke to Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk during a 25-minute call.  During the call, Trump told Mr Zelenskyy he would support Ukraine, without providing details, and Mr Musk said he would continue supplying Starlink satellites, Axios reported, citing unidentified sources. Mr Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine's defence effort, but his statements have sometimes angered Kyiv since Russia invaded its neighbour in 2022. Mr Zelenskyy was telling Trump how important the satellites had been for internet service during the war when Trump said Mr Musk was with him and put the billionaire on the line, the Washington Post reported. Trump and Mr Musk were at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach residence and club, when the call took place, according to the New York Times.

Ms Wiles, whose work has been mostly behind the scenes, was brought on stage by Trump during his victory speech earlier this week.  She rejected Trump's offer to speak to the packed crowd, as Trump said \"Suzie likes to stay in the background … we call her the ice maiden\". So what do we know about the Ms Wiles and Trump's history with chiefs of staff? The chief of staff has a critical role as the president's confidant and gatekeeper, while also making sure the White House is running smoothly. Consequently, this role typically has significant influence and involves a range of tasks and responsibilities. This includes managing White House staff, organising the president's schedule and maintaining contact with other government departments.  Overseeing the executive office, which is the president's closest advisers, also comes under the chief of staff's job. A successful chief of staff will balance different political and policy priorities with the president's overall agenda. Ms Wiles, 67, started her political career in the 1970s working for Republican Jack Kemp before joining Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.  Ms Wiles, daughter of NFL player Pat Summerall, then headed to Florida where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and worked for Republican Tillie Fowler. She then embarked in statewide political campaigns and also served as a senior adviser on Trump's 2016 presidential bid in Florida.  In 2018, Ms Wiles helped Ron DeSantis become Florida’s governor but ties between the two started to fray. Ms Wiles worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. \n  (Reuters: Brian Snyder) This relationship breakdown led to Mr DeSantis urging Trump’s 2020 campaign to cuts its links with Ms Wiles, while she was leading the state campaign.  She ended up running Trump’s primary campaign against Mr DeSantis and defeated the Florida governor.  Trump's recent success as America's president-elect has been credited to the campaign run by Ms Wiles.  Unlike past campaigns marked by backstabbing and turnover, Trump’s operation was widely praised for being his most competent and disciplined.  Learning from past campaign mistakes, aides were careful to save money for the race’s final stretch.  The campaign also took risks, including taking advantage of the support from billionaire Elon Musk, who was criticised for handing out $US1 million cheques to US voters. Trump ran through four chiefs of staff — an unusually high number — during his 2017 to 2021 term.  Reince Priebus was Trump's first chief of staff during a time when the White House was in the spotlight for infighting.  Mr Priebus was sometimes seen as untrustworthy by others who were competing for Trump's approval and he was pushed out after six months in the role.  Mr Priebus (left) was replaced by General John Kelly (right) as White House chief of staff. (Reuters/AP) Trump then appointed his Homeland Security secretary John Kelly, who was a former four-star Marine general. It was Mr Kelly's immigration crackdown during his tine with Homeland Security that appealed to Trump initially.  But he soon became frustrated by Mr Kelly's regimented approach to the White House and Trump eventually booted him from the position without having a replacement lined up. While Mr Kelly served as chief of staff the longest, the deterioration of his relationship with Trump became the most publicly bitter. Donald Trump prefers the \"dictator approach\" to running a country, and openly wished he had \"Hitler's generals\" when he was US president, his former White House chief of staff says. In October last year, Mr Kelly called his former boss a fascist who had a \"dictator approach\" to running a country. Former South Carolina congressman Mick Mulvaney became the next chief of staff. Mr Mulvaney held the job for more than a year, after abandoning Mr Kelly's strict approach to managing the former president.  He departed from the role in 2020 and was replaced by conservative congressman Mark Meadows. Mr Meadows played a key role in negotiating pandemic relief legislation and was seen as a loyalist who stood by Trump during his campaign for re-election against Joe Biden. Trump has previously said the biggest mistake he made was hiring the wrong people during his first term.  In a victory speech earlier in the week, the president-elect thanked Ms Wiles and his other campaign manager Chris LaCivita.  Trump added that while Ms Wiles likes to stay out of the spotlight, they call her the \"ice maiden\".  Trump says Ms Wiles is an \"ice maiden\". \n\n \n\n\n  (AP Photo: Alex Brandon) Several people who have worked with Ms Wiles said in interviews on Thursday she would provide stability and sage counsel to Trump in the White House, according to Reuters.  Republican strategist Ford O'Connell said she is a \"strong woman and a true leader with a proven track record of getting things done\".

(ABC News: Jonathan Drake) The death of an Australian economist two weeks ago may seem a strange starting point to reflect on a momentous week — and turning point — in global politics and policy. If the hyperbole and verbiage already expended on the US presidential election took physical form, we'd be cleaning it up for months, like some giant oil slick. So let's start instead with the death of Geoff Carmody, and all he contributed and represented, as a way of considering just how far Australia's own political and policy debates have shifted in the past four decades: shifts that are echoed, amplified and even thrown into question by Donald Trump's return. Peter Dutton is posing Trump's \"are you better off\" question in Australia and hoping to tap into the same anger over cost-of-living amongst working-class voters. Carmody was my friend for 40 years. More relevantly here, he has also been an important touchstone for considering many of the big policy debates that have dominated the Australian landscape during that time. It wasn't so much a matter of \"What would Geoff think about this?\" as \"How would he think about this?\" that would often lead me to call him in the rush to understand and consider some particular policy idea before deadline. Carmody was a product of the federal Treasury of the 1970s: an institution equally galvanised and appalled by the wilder days of the Whitlam government and left cynical and frustrated by the big talk but little action of the Fraser years.fa He would leave Treasury in the early 1980s to establish Access Economics with his friend David Chessell with the aim of providing a credible source of policy assessment and advice outside the public service. He worked on Fightback! and the National Commission of Audit for the federal Coalition and provided advice and policy costings for Labor oppositions at both federal and state levels. Carmody's economics was dry but his mind was always open. He would approach any policy idea with fresh eyes. Why is it particularly worth remembering him this week? Donald Trump's victory throws into sharp relief not just the seismic shift in the way policy debates and politics are now conducted in Australia — and globally — but because even the \"self-evident truths\" that underpinned the thinking of Geoff Carmody and many of his contemporaries cannot now be regarded as self-evident to those in positions of power. Americans may feel their government services have let them down. But little that Trump has said, in policy terms, offers a clear solution to the problems. (Reuters: Tom Brenner) Free trade and small government were ideas implicit in the economics of the past 40 years. Trump's proposed tariff wars would seem to put a full stop on what has been a gradual unravelling of any remaining free trade ambition in the world. Small government? Well, there now seems to be a very confused view of the role of government in places like the United States. It is seen to have failed voters, yet most of the rage is about its overreach. When the Bretton Woods economic system of fixed exchange rates unravelled in the 1970s, it was replaced with the mantras of free trade and small government and monetarism. The new unravelling occurs without any such clearly organised replacement. Populism and ultra-partisanship would seem to make even more difficult the chances of forming any underlying policy consensus that can survive changes of government. Both in the US and Australia, a trend to perceive or portray economic outcomes as ones that can solely be blamed on the incumbent government or administration has become stark. Voters in the US would repeatedly tell reporters that everything that had gone wrong in their economy had happened under Joe Biden's watch. In Australia, Peter Dutton and his colleagues blame Labor's policies since 2022 for things that have not just been problems for years but ones that are at the least the outcome of either their own policies, or the underlying policy consensus. Clear examples of that are the surge in post-COVID immigration (let alone the entire structure of an immigration system that is demand driven); the reliance of our universities on funding from foreign students; the many flaws now in our student debt systems, not to mention the housing supply crisis. It's hardly new to try to put all the blame on your opponents for things going wrong (and shift the blame from your own mistakes). But it feels like there is a breakdown in any agreement on what the underpinnings of policy might or should be. Denied joint ownership of policy means there is little interest in stewardship of that policy in the longer term. Peter Dutton and his colleagues blame Labor's policies for things that have not just been problems for years but ones that are at the least the outcome of either their own policies or the underlying policy consensus. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy) In Australia, the past 40 years have also been a period in which no self-respecting political party would put forward policies to voters unless they were not just fully articulated but fully costed: a process in which Carmody played a central part. We have long moved away from that self-respect. And from media scrutiny which demanded it. There is little real focus on policy, just on the politics of policy. Politicians like Donald Trump say they can now make things better. But only because they are promising to get rid of the very instruments of government by which they would make that happen: for example, functioning bureaucracies that can deliver services (no matter how dysfunctional they may currently be). Commentators in the United States have ascribed the Trump victory at its most simple to resentment about the cost of living. But it is also said to be a resentment based, longer term, in the failings of politics, government with a small 'g' and economics over those last 40 years when free market policies were linked to the decline in so much US industry, income levels and jobs. The political failure is often described as the one which dismissed the anger of middle America to have its grievances acknowledged and seen as legitimate. Americans may rightly feel their political, economic and government services have let them down. Real average wages, for starters, have barely moved in the past 40 years, except for those on the highest incomes. So it may be an entirely rational decision for voters to turn to a disrupter like Trump in their disillusion. But little that Trump has said, in policy terms, actually offers a clear solution to the problems. His most explicit policy prescriptions are the mass deportation of millions of undocumented workers and cutting taxes. Cutting taxes that is, except for where he is proposing to put them up in the form of tariffs which will make the cost of living higher for most Americans. The lessons our political leaders have taken out of the US election are (for the prime minister) the voters' message on the cost of living and (for the opposition leader) immigration. Those fights were already well underway here before this week's events. And our election campaign will not be fought out in the way the US campaign — at its most fatuous — was fought: as a battle between choosing rage or joy. But we should despair that it will feature little of the policy rigour or ambition that people like Geoff Carmody brought to battles gone by. Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.

(AP: Morry Gash ) Abortion and reproductive rights have been a divisive issue in the United States since Roe v Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022 and figured heavily in the election campaign. But it wasn't just a key difference between the platforms of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Ten states had abortion measures on their ballots, asking voters whether they wanted to enshrine reproductive rights in their state constitutions.  In some states this would have meant maintaining the status quo, but in others, it would pave the way to remove restrictions that were introduced after Roe v Wade was overturned. In most of the states, the measures have passed — although in some places, changing the rules is more complicated than a single vote. Here's a breakdown of how this issue landed on the same ballot as the US presidential election, and what happens next. It comes back to the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022. That court decision, made in 1973, ruled that the US constitution protected a woman's right to abortion. Because federal law takes precedence over conflicting state laws, it meant state and local lawmakers could not ban abortions – even if they wanted to. Conservative states got around this by restricting access to abortions or making them harder to get. But when Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022, the constitutional right to abortion was gone. Many states passed restrictions on abortions, some started enforcing pre-1973 laws and others banned the procedure in all but extreme circumstances. Abortion rights campaigners fought back by pushing to include protections in state law or wind back bans. Including the question on ballots, effectively holding state referendums on the issue, was one way to do that. Since 2022 every ballot measure across the country that would protect abortion access has passed — until this week. Seven states voted to enshrine the right to abortion in their constitutions: Colorado, New York, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, Arizona and Missouri. The measures failed in three states — Florida, South Dakota and Nebraska — meaning their existing restrictions will remain in place. In Nebraska, voters were also presented with an option to enshrine abortion restrictions into the constitution — which passed. You can read about each state in more depth further down. It has changed over the years. In this campaign, Donald Trump has said he believes states should set their own abortion laws. You can see what his policy was for yourself: At some points he had voiced support for a federal ban on abortions from 15 or 20 weeks, but he has also said he would not support a federal ban \"under any circumstances\". Video of a 2016 interview in which Trump said women should be \"punished\" for getting an abortion, if it were illegal, resurfaced during this campaign. \"There has to be some form of punishment,\" Trump said during an interview. \"For the woman?\" the reporter asked. \"Yes,\" Trump replied. At the time his team quickly walked back that comment, issuing a statement that said: \"The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb … my position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.\" If you go back even further, Trump once said he supported the right to abortion. In an interview in 1999, Trump described himself as \"strongly pro-choice\". \"I hate the concept of abortion … I just believe in choice,\" he said. JD Vance has been a loyal running mate, saying he supports Trump's view that it's an issue best left to the states. \"If… California wants to have a different abortion policy from Ohio, then Ohio has to respect California, and California has to respect Ohio,\" he told Fox news. \"Donald Trump's view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions, because we don't want to have a non-stop federal conflict over this issue.\" He also said Trump would veto any attempts to install a national abortion ban. As for his own view, in the VP debate, Vance said he has never supported a national abortion ban himself. This appears to be a shift from Vance's stance on abortion when he entered politics in 2022. In a podcast appearance while running for the Senate he said he would \"certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally\", and during a debate, said he would support some kind of minimum national standard. During the campaign Democrats capitalised on the issue, reminding voters that Donald Trump's presidency led to the overturning Roe v Wade in the first place. They claimed that if he was returned to office, abortion rights would become even more restricted. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaigned on protecting abortion rights in the states that still had them, and at one point a spokesperson said they were \"fighting to restore reproductive freedom in all 50 states\". \"Vice President Harris and Governor Walz trust women to make decisions about their own bodies, and not have the government tell them what to do,\" their position statement said. \"As President, she [Harris] will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, she will sign it.\" Abortion continues to be a big issue in America — for those who want to see it restricted and for those who defend reproductive rights. Kamala Harris mentioned it in her concession speech on Wednesday: I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. As for the ballot measures, it depends on each state. In the seven states that voted to protect abortion rights, their constitutions will be amended, making it harder to introduce bans in future. In Arizona and Missouri, where restrictions were introduced after Roe v Wade was overturned, this is the first step in undoing those restrictions. In the three states where abortion protection measures failed — Florida, South Dakota and Nebraska — the laws will not change and restrictions will remain in place. Nebraska will go a step further, enshrining a ban on abortions after the first trimester into its constitution. This measure has passed with more than 60 per cent support. Voters were asked whether they wanted to enshrine a \"fundamental right to abortion\" in the state's constitution. The measure will guarantee abortion rights up to \"fetal viability\", generally considered to be around 24 weeks, and allow later-term abortions if the woman's life or health is at risk. Arizona currently bans abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. Abortion is legal in Nevada, but after the overturning of Roe v Wade, abortion rights campaigners urged politicians to enshrine these rights into the constitution for further protection. Voters were asked to vote on an amendment that would guarantee all citizens \"a fundamental right to reproductive freedom\". More than 60 per cent of Nevada voters voted in favour of the amendment. However, changing Nevada's constitution requires voters to approve of amendments twice — so this issue will reappear on Nevada ballots in 2026. Voters must approve it again in order for it to take effect. Amendment 4 would have enshrined abortion rights in the Florida Constitution, allowing abortions \"before viability\" of the fetus, or until around the 24-week mark, instead of the six-week cut-off the state currently has. The measure failed to reach the 60 per cent support for it to pass. It's a huge win for the Florida governor Ron DeSantos, who was a key proponent. The loss marks the first time a ballot measure in support of abortion rights has failed since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. New York already has abortion access laws in place: Women are allowed to get an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and, after that, they can terminate if their health or pregnancy is at risk. The ballot question — which passed with more than 60 per cent support — didn't explicitly mention abortion, instead presenting voters with a proposal to \"protect against unequal treatment\" based on \"pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, as well as reproductive healthcare and autonomy\". This will effectively give constitutional protection to abortion rights. Abortion is legal in Montana up to \"fetal viability\", generally considered to be about 24 weeks of pregnancy. It is banned after that point. Voters chose to enshrine these rights in their state constitution, with about 57 per cent ticking yes. The amendment will \"provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion\" before fetal viability. Abortion is already legal in Colorado at all stages of pregnancy. However, under a law passed in 1984, spending public money on abortions was banned. The measure on the ballot — now approved with more than 60 per cent voting yes — will enshrine existing abortion protections into the state's constitution, as well as repeal the ban on state and local funding for abortion. This change will allow government health insurance programs to cover the procedure. Maryland state law already protects the right to abortion. But in Tuesday's ballot, voters were asked whether they would like to enshrine these rights into the state's constitution. The amendment will guarantee the \"individual's fundamental right to reproductive freedom\", including the right to continue or end one's pregnancy. The measure passed with overwhelming support; 75 per cent of voters said yes. Missouri voters have paved the way to undo one of America's most restrictive abortion bans. The state currently only allows abortions in cases of medical emergencies, and there are no exceptions for rape or incest. The amendment approved at the ballot box — with just over 50 per cent support — will enshrine in the state constitution people's rights to make decisions about their reproductive health. This does not undo the law on its own, however. Abortion rights advocates will need to go to court to overturn the ban. Like Missouri, South Dakota has some of the country's most restrictive abortion laws. It is illegal to perform the procedure — at any point of the pregnancy — unless the patient's life is at risk. Unlike Missouri, South Dakota did not vote for change. The ballot measure in South Dakota would have allowed people to challenge the abortion ban by enshrining rights in the constitution. If passed, the state would have been banned from interfering with a woman's decision to get an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment was rejected, with only 40 per cent voting yes. Voters were given two options: Do they want to enshrine the state's current abortion restrictions into the constitution? Or do they want to give women the right to have an abortion until viability? The competing constitutional amendments were a nation-wide first. Ultimately the state voted in favour of abortion restrictions. The current restrictions — which ban abortions in the second and third trimesters except for medical emergencies, rape or incest — will be written into the constitution.

(AP: Alex Brandon) Prosecutors in the US have charged an alleged Iranian \"asset\" Farhad Shakeri, over a plot to kill Donald Trump. It's alleged Shakeri was taking orders from Iran's military, which had tasked him with carrying out hits on multiple people. Two other men have been arrested in New York over one of the alleged plots — not involving Trump — and will remain in custody pending a trial. The US Justice Department (DOJ) has charged an Iran-based man over a plot to kill president-elect Donald Trump, allegedly sanctioned by the Islamic Republic's military and intelligence agency. In a statement released Friday, local time, the DOJ alleged Iranian \"asset\" Farhad Shakeri, 51, had been \"tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill\" Trump. The DOJ alleged Iran's Revolutionry Guard Corps (IRGC) — the country's hardline military and intelligence agency — had ordered the hit. While Trump was the only alleged target named by the DOJ, the statement made it clear the charges reflected multiple separate blueprints to kill American and Israeli citizens in the US, and elsewhere. Shakeri remains at large, and likely living in Tehran, according to the DOJ. A sworn statement tendered to a New York Court and signed by special agent Mathew Chrusz claimed Shakeri had lifted the lid on multiple plans during taped phone interviews with the FBI, given voluntarily, between September and November. The statement said he had immigrated to the US as a child but had been deported \"in or about 2008\" after serving 14 years behind bars for a robbery. While Shakeri is believed to live in Iran, he is an Afghan national. In one plot, the DOJ alleged Shakeri had been tasked with surveilling two Jewish-American citizens in New York, and had been offered $US500,000 ($760,000) to murder either of them. In another, it was alleged he had been ordered to kill Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. \"The charges announced today expose Iran's continued brazen attempts to target US citizens, including President-elect Donald Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who criticise the regime in Tehran,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — a designated foreign terrorist organisation — has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on US soil and that simply won't be tolerated. \"Thanks to the hard work of the FBI, their deadly schemes were disrupted. \"We're committed to using the full resources of the FBI to protect our citizens from Iran or any other adversary who targets Americans.\" Trump was the subject of multiple failed assassination attempts during his run for president, which culminated in a sweeping election victory on Tuesday. The alleged plots detailed in the DOJ release are not related to the previous attempts on Trump's life. While Shakeri was alleged to have multiple assassination plots on the go, the DOJ has charged two other men, Carlisle Rivera, 49, and Jonathon Loadholt, 36, over a plan to murder an American citizen with Iranian heritage in New York. They were on Thursday arrested in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island respectively and remain in custody. It's alleged they met Shakeri in prison. Special Agent Chrusz's sworn statement filed in the court alleges Shakeri \"has a network of criminal associated that he met during his time in prison to supply the IRGC with operatives to conduct surveillance and assassinations\". While prosecutors did not specify who their alleged target was, the description matches outspoken journalist Masih Alinejad, who has been critical of the Islamic Republic's conservative religious regime. The sworn statement claimed Shakeri had promised to pay $US100,000 to Rivera and Loadholt if they carried out the murder. According to the sworn statement, Shakeri and Rivera exchanged voice notes (recordings) discussing efforts to locate the target in April. \"This bitch is hard to catch, bro,\" it's alleged Rivera said in one of them. The court documents claimed that, in another voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that \"you just gotta have patience\". The documents alleged that, in text messages, Shakeri had promised Rivera $US100,000 to \"finish the work\". US Attorney-General Merrick Garland said Iran was endangering America's national security. \"There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,\" he said in a statement.

(ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) Step inside Ashok Parekh's office and it is immediately clear he is not a typical charted accountant. The shelves are overflowing with sporting and other memorabilia.   Alongside bobblehead figurines of US presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and the newly re-elected Donald Trump, three red-coloured baseball caps stand out. One is branded WA Labor, next to an election poster signed by former Premier Mark McGowan.  Another is emblazoned with Mr Trump's famous presidential campaign line, \"Make America Great Again\", while the third says \"Make Hannan Street Great Again\".  The novelty hat is a local take on Donald Trump's campaign slogan for Kalgoorlie's main street. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) The novelty cap was a gift from a barista working on Hannan Street, the main street of Kalgoorlie named in honour of the pioneering prospector Paddy Hannan. His discovery 131 years ago kick-started one of the world's biggest gold rushes.  The mining city, 600 kilometres east of Perth, is hoping the tension driven by a second Trump presidency could drive the gold price even higher. A statue of Irish prospector Paddy Hannan stands outside the Kalgoorlie Town Hall. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) Like Hannan, Mr Parekh is an Irish immigrant, whose success as a entrepreneur since arriving 40 years ago has earned him the the unofficial moniker \"King of Kalgoorlie\".   Not only does he own pubs and hotels, he has been involved in countless mining ventures and currently chairs ASX-listed gold miner Horizon Minerals.  The Kalgoorlie CBD is dominated by the courthouse with its distinctive clock tower. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) While Mr Parekh strongly disagrees with Mr Trump's immigration policies, wearing his \"red\" hat as a mining executive, he believes the return to the White House of the former reality TV star and his \"strong, hard stance\" will only push gold prices higher.  \"I think the gold price is going to go up anyway,\" he said.  \"Trump winning [means] it will probably go up more and the reason is there's going to be economic turmoil to a degree ... they're saying we're worried about America, we're not worried about anybody else.\" Donald Trump speaks at a rally in California last month. (Reuters: Mike Blake) This year's unprecedented gold run during the lead-up to the US election has again set tongues wagging about what it could mean for the city's economy after it was hit by the demise of its once-booming nickel industry.   Gold prices have risen from about $3,000 an ounce at the start of the year to trade above $4,000 an ounce in Australian dollar terms for the first time.  The entry statement at Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport claims the title of gold capital of Australia. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) It peaked at $4,236/oz on October 28, according to Kitco data, and fell about $80/oz on election night after it became clear Mr Trump would win.   \"There are people I know who never thought in their lifetime they would see gold at this price,\" Mr Parekh said.  \"It will be good for Kalgoorlie … there will be acquisitions, mergers, investors will support companies which can get into production quickly and make cash.\" Herbert Hoover served as the 31st President of the United States. (Supplied: Gwalia Museum) The WA Goldfields has a unique connection to the US dating back more than a century.   Former US President Herbert Hoover made his fortune as a young geologist during the gold rush working for a London syndicate. He had convinced the syndicate to make him manager of the Gwalia mine, about 240 kilometres north of Kalgoorlie.     A truck emerges from the Gwalia mine, which was established in 1897 by Herbert Hoover. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Jarrod Lucas) Gwalia is still being mined at depths up to 2km below the surface via an underground access portal known as the Hoover Decline.   Last year it was sold as part of a $631 million deal to ASX-listed Genesis Minerals.    The gold miner's managing director, Raleigh Finlayson, said forecasts for gold were about $2,500 an ounce when the deal was done.   Raleigh Finlayson is managing director of WA gold miner Genesis Minerals. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) Mr Finlayson described this year's run as \"phenomenal\".   The Kalgoorlie-born mining engineer, who spent six months in the US studying an advanced management course at Harvard University in 2021, noted the gold price rose 55 per cent during Mr Trump's first presidential term.   \"I'm usually bearish on the gold price … we plan for the worst and hope for the best,\" he said.   \"We try and manage our business over a decade.\" He said his business planned for the gold price to be lower. \"The reality is gold generally does well when the world isn't in great shape, and that's probably been the main driver in my opinion,\" he said. In Mr Hoover's era, from the early 1900s until 1934, the US dollar gold price was fixed at $20.67 an ounce, under a gold standard which was introduced in Great Britain in 1821 and adopted by many other countries in the 1870s.    It was increased to $US35 an ounce in January 1934 as Franklin Roosevelt's government dealt with the impact of the Great Depression Gold mining enjoyed a renaissance in Western Australia. The gold price continued to be regulated worldwide until 1971 when it became freely floated.   Today, the spot price of gold varies from moment to moment as gold is traded in markets spread around the globe in London, New York, Sydney, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Sandra Close has followed the ups and downs of the gold price for decades. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas) Sandra Close, of Melbourne consultancy Surbiton Associates, said she had been stunned by the gold run. \"All we've been doing is watching the gold price go up and up and up … the rise we've had in the last couple of weeks has been extraordinary,\" she said. \"You have to assume a lot of it has to do with uncertainty around the election … I am not sure if anyone knows what the effect is going to be [on gold].\" The Australian dollar gold price has soared this year. (Supplied: Perth Mint) The 125-year-old Perth Mint refines about three-quarters of Australia's newly mined gold.   The mint is holding 8.43 tonnes of gold for clients, which is up more than 6 per cent in the past three months.   Perth Mint depository general manager John O'Donoghue said predicting the price was near impossible.   \"Some people are cashing out at these prices and selling, whereas others are buying because they believe gold will go higher,\" he said.   John O'Donoghue was appointed the Perth Mint's general manager of depository in 2023. (Supplied: Perth Mint) He said the US election, coupled with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, increased central bank buying and uncertainty about US interest rates had combined to make a perfect storm for gold. \"I think all those factors together are contributing to the record high prices,\" he said.   \"I wouldn't say the outcome of the US election is the key factor, but it's definitely a contributing factor.\" Browse for your location and find more local ABC News and information Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Commodities Markets Topic:Gold Topic:Gold Gold Kalgoorlie Leonora US Elections World Politics Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

During the campaign, Trump has called climate change a hoax, a scam, and has promised to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from international climate action. As a global superpower and the world's second-largest emitter, what the US does will have ripple effects around the world. But unpicking the climate policies in his own country could prove unpopular and hard to achieve. And the world is in a very different place since his first stint in the White House — the clean energy transition is now a global race for dominance. On American soil, Trump risks a blowback from his own supporters if he makes good on his promise to end the landmark climate policy passed by the Biden administration two years ago. \"My plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam,\" Trump said. Curiously named, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a sweeping package that unleashed funding and tax credits for climate change investments across America, as Columbia Business School climate economist Gernot Wagner explains. \"The Inflation Reduction Act, in many ways, is the most ambitious climate policy anywhere, period,\" Mr Wagner said. A staggering 85 per cent of the investments from the IRA have gone to projects in Republican congressional districts — Trump communities. The IRA has poured billions of dollars into clean technologies across the country, such as electric vehicles manufacturing, batteries, solar, and household upgrades. \"So for consumers, $US6 billion ($9 billion) or so set aside for heat pumps and upgrading your home electric system and insulating your home and buying your induction stove and all these sorts of things.\" But the most significant funds flow to big businesses to drive manufacturing and investment in clean energy technology across America. It has increased overall investment in climate solutions by using tax credits. \"You don't just get a blank check. You actually need to spend at least twice as much money. This full package encapsulates a trillion plus in spending, leveraging over $3 trillion in private investment,\" Mr Wagner said. Gernot Wagner is a climate economist at the University of Columbia Business School. (Suppied: Gernot Wagner) There are two key reasons why red states have benefited so significantly, according to Mr Wagner. \"Renewables take up space … states with lots of land [are] typically Republican, often Republican. \"The second [reason] in many ways is by design, by political design.\" This complicates the path for Trump in unwinding it. The IRA has many fans within his own party, politicians who see their home towns and counties benefiting from new manufacturing projects and jobs. The IRA also offers carrots to fossil fuel companies to implement technologies to curb their emissions, such as carbon capture and storage. \"It means on the one hand, we are paying industry to get cleaner … it also of course means that there are champions for the IRA in fairly unusual places,\" said Mr Wagner. One of the people to benefit from the IRA is his key ally, Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. The IRA offers tax credits for people buying Telsa's electric cars, but more importantly, it has wide-ranging tax credits across the entire battery production chain. Elon Musk has emerged as a major supporter of Donald Trump in his campaign. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) According to one analysis from Johns Hopkins University, the IRA has contributed $US44 billion in manufacturing capacity. More than 90 per cent of that manufacturing investment has gone into the battery supply chain, driving down the overall cost of electric cars. It found that US-made batteries receive strong support from the IRA, totalling about one-third the cost of a battery. Mr Musk's overwhelming support during the election campaign may just add another obstacle for Trump in winding back the climate legislation. The IRA's success underscores how different the world's standing on clean technologies is today compared to Trump's first presidency in 2016. The world's economies are being reshaped around clean technologies, according to climate scientist Bill Hare. \"[It's] very risky, I think, for the US to change track away from clean energy and clean tech, because that's the way the world is going,\" he said. \"We have fundamentally more investment going on now in clean tech than fossil fuels, that's very different than five or six years ago. That's going to be, I think, a big tailwind in keeping action moving forward.\" Texas, a traditional red state, is a leader in renewable energy. (Supplied: Sarah Fields) Mr Hare has been a key figure in international climate spaces since 1989 as a climate scientist and IPCC lead author, and now leads the think tank Climate Analytics. He believes that American businesses will put pressure on the Trump administration to maintain its position in clean technology development. \"American business hates to fall behind on the technology space. If the US goes slow, it's going to be overtaken by China, the EU and others. That'll be something that'll be worrying American capital a lot.\" In many ways, the US has already been overtaken by China's astonishing clean technology boom. Bill Hare is in Azerbaijan for COP29. (ABC News: Rhiannon Shine) Mr Hare points out that the Biden administration has overseen a boom in oil and gas. \"Let's be frank, under the Biden administration, we've seen much more oil and gas development in recent times than have happened before. So [it's] not as though we're dealing with a complete utopia in the US climate policy space.\" Kingsmill Bond from the Rocky Mountain Institute, which analyses clean energy trends, says China is driving the transition to renewables. \"This obviously confuses people because in most areas for the last 30 to 50 years, the United States has led and other countries have followed,\" Mr Bond said. \"China is clearly leading in almost every aspect of the energy transition and therefore we need to focus more on what happens in China and what happens in in other countries.\" This comes after years of government investment in renewable energy technologies to put them ahead of the rest of the world. \"There is this race to the top to lead the energy technologies of the future … you cannot hold back the tide of change,\" he stated. Bill Hare says this race has gone global. \"The reason why China has got the jump on critical technologies, electric vehicles, batteries, manufacturing capacity and renewables is because to some extent, policymakers in the US and Europe went to sleep at the wheel. They didn't roll out the kind of incentives needed in the way that China has. \"But I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that China would maintain the lead in these indefinitely. I think the right level of policy action, levers and incentives would enable others to catch up. And not just Europe and the US, but also other centres. \"We're seeing a growth of, for example, electric vehicle manufacturing in India now at scale … the numbers are quite staggering.\" Mr Bond says while international climate pacts such as the Paris Agreement have focused on the need to help the global south, the evidence shows these regions are pushing ahead on climate change, regardless of who is in the White House.\" And China's boom is making it cheaper for other countries to make the transition. \"We found that, in fact, 20 per cent of the global south has already leapfrogged what's going on in the global north and that 60 per cent of the global south is just rising up like everyone else. \"Because it's not surprising for the folks in Pakistan or Namibia or Bangladesh or Uruguay or Chile or Vietnam, they too want local cheap energy, and they too can buy cheap stuff from China and harness the sun. So why wouldn't they? And that's exactly what they're doing.\" China is already a leader in renewable energy technology.\n\n  (Getty: Song Wei/VCG) And Bill Hare says China is now in a position to start reducing its emissions, which could offset some of the damage of the US falling behind. \"We think in our own calculations that China has peaked its emissions already, and [they will] begin to start going down. If they double down on that, then the damage from the US being out of the game for four or five years will not be catastrophic.\" In his first presidency, Trump unpicked over 100 pieces of environmental policy across the US, including regulations on fuel efficiency standards aimed at reducing transport emissions, and became the first and only country to withdraw from the international climate pact, the Paris Agreement. He again derided the Paris Agreement during this year's campaign, leading many experts to believe he will again withdraw from it and possibly the UN treaty on climate change, the UNFCCC. The world will progress on the path to net zero — with or without Donald Trump. (Reuters: Simon Dawson) But Mr Hare says the fears of Trump's first withdrawal were overstated. \"When that happened, many pundits predicted that the Paris Agreement would collapse and stop, but it actually didn't. Whilst a shock at the time, in retrospect, the Trump withdrawal of the United States did not really significantly affect momentum.\" Climate experts watching to see if China will step into an international leadership role will get an indication at COP29, the world's annual climate conference, next week. A key goal for this year's COP is climate finance: getting wealthy countries like the US and Australia to commit more funding to help developing countries address the threats of climate change and transition their economies. Christian Downie thinks countries in Asia will be key in the climate leadership space. (Supplied: ANU) \"There's no doubt that the Trump election will cast a shadow over the COP. It is going to make the task of agreeing on a new finance goal much more difficult,\" says Mr Hare from Azerbaijan, where it is being held. The biggest concern is Trump's climate handbrake extending beyond the US. Christian Downie is an associate professor in the School of Regulation and Global Governance at the ANU who focuses on climate politics and diplomacy. He's watching to see which countries step into the climate leadership space. \"I think Europe will be considering the role it can play. But I think what's going to be more important is countries in Asia,\" he said. \"Will countries like China work more closely with the European counterparts to take a leadership role? Will Brazil, who's going to be hosting the UN negotiations the following year, take on more of a leadership role?\" This doesn't mean that there will be no impact on the climate from a Trump presidency. In fact, a Carbon Brief analysis predicted that emissions would rise under Trump by a staggering 4 billion tonnes by 2030 if the IRA was wound back. The world is halfway through the \"critical decade\" for climate action, and Trump will be president until 2029. His actions will, at the very least, impact his country's ability to meet its 2030 targets. This all matters, as rising global temperatures are tied directly to how much carbon pollution is emitted. More emissions, more warming. More emissions also means more climate disasters, like the hurricanes that hit during the presidential election campaign, and the recent devastating Spanish floods. \"These things are going to get worse and worse. And no amount of bluster from climate deniers is going to change that. There's going to be increasing political pressure on politicians everywhere to act. So I think there's going to be more of a reckoning to come,\" Mr Hare warns. The world is on the cusp of reversing gears on global greenhouse gas emissions. For Mr Wagner, the clean technology momentum cannot be stopped, but it can be slowed in the US. \"The raw economics, the plant-level economics, the bottom-up business case for renewables is there. There's nothing that will stop that. What Trump can do is delay, obfuscate, attempt to withdraw the IRA. \"I think the biggest problem with a Trump presidency is the uncertainty.\" Listen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and Kriol Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:US Elections Topic:Climate Change Topic:Extreme Weather Events ACT Alternative Energy Climate Change Energy Industry NSW NT QLD SA TAS US Elections United States VIC WA Topic:Health Topic:US Elections Topic:Explainer Topic:Explainer Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:Health Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War Topic:AFL Women’s Topic:Unrest, Conflict and War We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

(Reuters: Alyssa Pointer) It was a simple message, printed in large letters on the chests and heads of thousands of Trump supporters: \"Jesus is my Savior, Trump is my president.\" After he survived an assassination attempt, Donald Trump, the 45th and soon to be 47th president of the United States accelerated his shift from hero to messiah in the eyes of his supporters. His rallies were already drenched with religious language and symbolism: he was a martyr, an unlikely angel, a fighter for Christians, a protector of the faith. Saved by God, anointed by God, often confused with God. Trump would pause, mid-speech and his voice would soften: \"Christians, I love Christians.\" And indeed Christians have been crucial to his winning the White House, again. As the post-election headline read in Christianity Today: \"Trump's path to victory still runs through the church.\" JD Vance, who is Catholic, accused Kamala Harris of \"anti-Catholic bias\" when she said she would not accept religious exemptions from providing insurance coverage for abortions. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) In the hours after his victory speech in Florida, a crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach Convention Centre pooled in a lobby and sang How Great Thou Art, a hymn of praise and awe, at a mighty God that can wreak miracles on earth. It begins: \"When I in awesome wonder / Consider all the works / Thy hands have made / I see the stars / I hear the rolling thunder / Thy pow'r throughout / The universe displayed!\" The power of God. The power of the presidency. The power of Trump. As we crunch data and pore over the exit polls to try to get an understanding of the way America voted this week, along with the economy and immigration, religion must also be understood as a decisive factor delivering victory to the Republicans. Trump had majority support across all major religious groups — Washington Post exit polls found 58 per cent of Catholics (who had previously supported Biden by a 20-point margin). One in five voters is Catholic (and one in four in Pennsylvania). JD Vance is, of course, Catholic, and accused Harris of \"anti-Catholic bias\" when she said she would not accept religious exemptions from providing insurance coverage for abortions. About six in 10 Mormons backed Trump too. But by far Trump's strongest religious supporters were white evangelicals — broadly defined as bible-believing Christians — who are two out of every 10 voters (22 per cent). In 2020, 76 per cent of them supported Trump; in 2024, 82 per cent did, with even higher proportions in crucial swing states like Georgia. The campaign was increasingly depicted as not political combat, but spiritual warfare by a constituency that see themselves as increasingly under attack, a besieged army that needs a strong-man leader to ward off their enemies. To, as declared on one T-shirt where Jesus was shown laying hands on Donald Trump, \"Make America Godly Again\". The mingling of faith, patriotism and conservatism is not new. Nor is a hearkening back to core values of community, family, connection and security. Then President Donald Trump holds a bible at St John's Church near the White House in June 2020. But the strong Christian support for Trump has perplexed many outside the church: a convicted felon who has been married three times, found by a court to have sexually abused a woman, allegedly had an affair with a porn star (without a condom, she claimed) when his wife was pregnant, who has boasted of \"grabbing women by the pussy\", performed fellatio on a microphone, who speaks of opponents as \"vermin\", of women as \"bitches\", war veterans as \"losers\" and Democrats as \"retards\". It doesn't scream \"love thy enemy\" or \"blessed are the meek\". After all, Trump has not demonstrated a love of piety or devotion to church previously. When asked to name a favourite biblical verse he demurred and said the whole Bible was special. When asked if he sought God's forgiveness, he said no. Still, some believe he has a faith, that he has somehow repented. Others just don't care. As influential Southern Baptist pastor Robert Jeffress told NPR shortly after the Access Hollywood \"grab them by the pussy\" tape dropped: \"I don't want some meek or mild leader or somebody who's going to turn the other cheek. I want the meanest, toughest S.O.B I can find to protect this nation.\" As Tim Alberta points out in his superb book, The Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, these leaders reached a point where they \"no longer cared about fighting evil with good, they \"just wanted to fight evil, period\". In other words, flaws are accepted in Trump because he is seen as a flawed hero, like the leaders in the Bible who were clearly flawed men — David, Solomon and King Cryus, who was a Persian leader who protected the Israelites even though he didn't worship the same God. The greater Trump's criminal difficulties, the greater his support from evangelicals, most of whom did not think he had done anything wrong. If the barbarians are at the gate, they reason, then you need a barbarian to fight them. Donald Trump will return to the White House with what he calls a \"powerful mandate\". Here's a look at the policies he's put forward. Many evangelicals worry America is at the abyss, that Christianity is \"at the crosshairs\", and that secularism will devour faith, scorning the values of the devout. There is evidence that traditional Christianity is in decline. In 2007, 78 per cent of Americans identified with Christianity — this had dropped to 63 per cent by 2021. Only a third of millennials believe in God, compared to 89 per cent of their parents. What I hadn't realised before reading Alberta's book is how the COVID pandemic exacerbated this sense of persecution amongst many Christians. When Democratic governors called for a pause on public gatherings, including churches, it was as though their fears of secular shutdown had been realised, and many congregations became increasingly politicised. Some grumbled that they had done more to stop Christians from worshipping during COVID than they did to stop immigrants coming across the border. It's important to remember that the term \"evangelical\" has a broader meaning in the US than in Australia and the UK. John Dickson, an Australian Anglican cleric, author and historian, points out that as a lot of American evangelicals — perhaps as much as a third — don't regularly attend church, \"They are 'evangelical' in a nominal sense, in the same way that many Australians were 'Anglican' in the 1960s\". \"Evangelical comes to mean a generally conservative, pro-religion kind of American, who may or may not have an active spiritual faith,\" says Dickson, professor of biblical studies at Wheaton College. (According to Christianity Today, more Trump supporters began calling themselves evangelicals after 2020, \"even if they hadn't previously used the label and weren't going to church\".) This is something, Dickson says, that is hard to get his head around as a foreigner. \"Something like 30 per cent of evangelicals either sat the election out or voted for Harris,\" he says. \"The remainder — the clear majority — voted for Trump. But the reasons are mixed. \"Some are just rusted on conservative, without any particular religious motivation. But many others I have spoken to tell me they dislike Trump but are 'voting for policies' not a person. When I press them about what policies, they usually reference law and order, illegal immigration and, of course, abortion. Harris's indication late in the campaign that she doesn't support a religious exemption [for abortion] for religious healthcare providers cemented in their minds that the Democrats would curb religious freedoms.\" John Dickson says the growing \"Christian nationalism\" movement in America is a \"disturbing minority\". (Supplied) Dickson says the growing \"Christian nationalism\" movement in America is a \"disturbing minority\": \"In my view, Christian nationalism is a blasphemy — or perhaps less dramatically, an oxymoron.\" Yet a national survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings Institution found that about two in three white evangelicals either directly supported the idea of Christian nationalism or were sympathetic to it. And Republican primary voters now trust Trump more than the church, at 71 per cent to 44 per cent, according to an August 2023 CBS/YouGov poll. In his victory speech, Trump said: \"Many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason. And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\" But people like Alberta — the Christian son of a conservative pastor — worry that the fact that so many Christians compartmentalise standards by allowing Trump to act as he pleases, and offend large swathes of the population without impunity, will erode the credibility of the church. He likens their stance to \"the way a suburban husband views Las Vegas — a self contained escape, a place where the rules and expectations of everyday life do not apply\".

(Reuters: Brian Snyder) If you've ever watched a clip of a Donald Trump rally and paid attention to the crowd behind him, you might think you know what a typical Trump voter looks like. White. Male. Head-to-toe in MAGA merch. And enthusiastically cheering at every angry Trumpism, no matter how offensive, discriminatory or mean.  But away from the rallies and the MAGA cult fandom, here's something that might surprise you: a lot of Trump voters say they wish he'd watch his mouth. \"You might not like him personally, and he has some quirks, I totally agree,\" Mary Senuta, a member of a Pennsylvania Republican women's group, told me. \"But I'm voting on policy, not personality. \"We've had four years [since Trump's presidency] and if you ask someone, 'Were you better off four years ago than you are today,' if they say no, they're lying.\" Mary Senuta is part of a Republican women group in Pennsylvania's Westmoreland County. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) By the time I had this chat with Mary, at a casino outside Pittsburgh on election night, I'd heard this same thing over and over. In the days and weeks leading up to the election, I'd spent a lot of time talking to Trump voters, particularly in battleground Pennsylvania. I spoke to people queuing for his rallies, people doorknocking homes to campaign, and people at volunteer centres, polling stations and election-evening events. I even knocked on the doors of houses that were dressed up in Trump paraphernalia, trying to fully understand the mindsets and motivations of his Pennsylvania supporters. Many of them are indeed superfans. This group of MAGA diehards love the way he rails against political correctness, trash talks \"elites\", and fights the culture wars. Some are racist and misogynistic. But, as the demographic data from exit polls shows, a lot of Trump voters don't match the stereotype, and were keen to point out they knew he had his problems. In the swing county of Erie, retired corrections officer Brian Shank went to great lengths to help get Trump elected.  Brian Shank used his \"Trump trailer\" to help sign people up to vote. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) He built a \"Trump trailer\" with a homemade lookalike mannequin, and parked it by the public dock, where he helped people sign up to vote. Still, he admitted, he had reservations.  \"Is he an angel? No,\" Brian said. \"Does he do crazy things I don't agree with? Absolutely. But he gets the job done.\" Less than an hour's drive south-east of Pittsburgh is a place once known as \"Glass City\". Its real name is Jeannette – named after the wife of one of the glassmakers who drove the town's boom last century. At Jeannette's peak, seven glass factories employed thousands. Now, they've all closed. The population's halved to below 10,000, and a quarter of the town lives in poverty.  Jeannette, Pennsylvania, was once home to seven glass factories. Now there are none. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) When I asked a polling station volunteer, a well-presented woman of the Boomer generation, if Jeannette was a good place to live, she looked at me like it might be a trick question. \"Well,\" she said, \"I think if you asked a lot of people, it still has a bit of a bad reputation. We've had our problems, you know, with drugs and things.\" In a place like this, a lot of voters are thinking about one thing only. \"Groceries, gas, you name it, all of our utilities have gone up,\" Jeannette resident Jen Galbraith said. \"It's just insane, the price increases over the past few years.\" It was enough to get Jen out to vote for Trump in her first ever presidential election.  Jen Galbraith said \"insane\" living costs motivated her to vote for the first time. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Asked for her views on Kamala Harris, she said she felt indifferent. \"It's just the fact she's been in office for four years,\" she said. \"Her and Biden have done nothing to help the economy. And when Trump was in office, we flourished.\" According to CNN's exit poll, 83 per cent of Trump voters in Pennsylvania felt their family's financial situation was worse today than four years ago, and 91 per cent said the economy was in poor shape. Even in affluent neighbourhoods in Pittsburgh, I heard similar sentiments. During Trump's reign, people in Pennsylvania's second-largest city \"watched as industry and jobs opened up\", lawyer Eric Jackson Lurie told me. \"There was a point where I was driving down the street one day, and this was few years into his presidency, and I just realised every business had signs saying 'help wanted',\" he said. \"I remember calling my wife, going, 'Oh my gosh, this is crazy, what this president has been able to do with this economy – like, there are jobs everywhere'.\" Of course, people mentioned other issues. Immigration was a huge one. Trump-fuelled fears of an \"invasion\" at the Mexican border are widely held. \"It's something I'm going to worry about because I have children now,\" one young woman, a first-time voter, said through tears after she cast her vote for Trump.  \"There's rapists, drug dealers, all these things coming over here and I'm scared for my kids.\" But often, people would tie the immigration issue back to their own personal finances. I travelled to the Pennsylvania borough of Charleroi when Trump began describing it as a place experiencing \"massive crime\" committed by its growing Haitian community. (Local authorities, citing crime data, say that's untrue.) Many of Charleroi's downtown shops are now empty. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) When I asked people in Charleroi how they felt about migration from Haiti, some expressed strong views. But they didn't mention crime. Instead, a lot of them took exception to the financial support given to asylum seekers, which wasn't available to citizens.  \"I've worked my entire life, and they live better than me,\" resident Kevin Armstrong said. But many more people in Charleroi wanted to talk about what they said was the town's real problem – the impending closure of its Pyrex plant, the last remaining glass factory, cutting hundreds of jobs. \"We're worried about the glass factory,\" one elderly man said after I asked about immigration. \"That's the big issue right now.\" If you speak to a Trump supporter about politics for long enough, there's a good chance they will start talking about election fraud. As voting was closing across the United States and the count was getting underway, the streets around Howard University in Washington DC were buzzing. That feeling didn't last. For years, Trump's been pushing, without evidence, the claim that he would have won the White House in 2020 if Democrats hadn't \"cheated\". In many conservative circles, that now seems to have become conventional wisdom. Trump supporters have been told not to trust the election officials, investigators and more than 60 judges who have rejected his claim.  So, many of them don't. Some insisted on showing me social media posts or online videos to support their suspicions. Outside a polling station on election day, one man shared his \"proof\" it was happening again this year.  It was a photo of, supposedly, a ballot paper with a small, black dot printed in the circle next to Kamala Harris's name. \"That dot is so the machine will count it as a vote for Kamala,\" he told me. I asked him where the photo was taken.  \"A friend saw it on Facebook,\" he said.  When I suggested it might not be genuine, he conceded that was possible. But, he said, there was so much of this \"proof\" online, surely some of it was real? People cast their ballots in Jeannette, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) Other conspiracy theories are now widely believed also.  I spent some time in south-west Pennsylvania with some canvassers who were going door to door to encourage Republicans to make a plan to vote. One, a retired special education teacher, choked up as she told me she was doing the work for the sake of her grandchildren. \"I just feel like I have a responsibility to them,\" she said. She was clearly driven by good intentions; a desire to do her part to make the world a better place.  And she seemed unable to accept that not all Trump voters were the same. She insisted that the January 6 insurrection was not the doing of Trump supporters. Rather, \"plants\" were behind the violence at the Capitol Building. She knew this, because she had watched \"many informational videos\" about it, she told me. And besides, she said, \"I know Republicans, and we don't act that way. They weren't our people.\" For me, one of the most surprising things about Trump supporters was how willing they were to talk to me, and how generous they were with their time. Trump never misses an opportunity to attack journalists and journalism. He popularised the term \"fake news\" years ago. He regularly uses it to describe critical, rather than false, reporting – and as a blanket term for the media as a whole. At one of his final rallies, he joked that he wouldn't mind if the reporters there were shot. But if his supporters in Pennsylvania shared his disdain for the press, they did not show it. A sign seen by the side of the road in Jeannette on election day. (ABC News: Brad Ryan) I have to acknowledge that being Australian helps. In at least some cases, being a white male probably doesn't hurt either. But I was taken aback by how many Trump voters told me they enjoyed spending time with a reporter, and how much they appreciated being interviewed and able to give their perspective. \"Thank you for doing this. It is really, really important what you do,\" one told me. \"People probably don't tell you that enough.\" In a polarised America, a lot of people have stopped talking to one another. Instead, many default to the worst assumptions about those with different politics to their own. I sensed that at least some of the gratitude came from a desire to be seen, heard and understood. Now their man is headed back to the White House, it'll be interesting to see if they feel they're listened to over the next four years.
