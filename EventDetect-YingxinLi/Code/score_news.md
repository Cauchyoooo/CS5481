> Here we use GPT4o to help us score the preference (prefer Republican or Democratic parties) of news

## Input

`main_events_by_date.json`

## prompt

Here are some news about 2024 US Elections. For each main event, calculate the Republican-Democratic Score (RD Score): You can score from 0 to 10 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The more favorable it is to the Republicans or the more unfavorable to the Democrats, the closer the score is to 10 points; the more favorable it is to the Democrats or the more unfavorable to the Republicans the closer the score is to 0 points; a neutral event is 5 points. Don't just focus the people who appear the news, if the event of this party will increase Negative emotions(worry,angry) we consider it unfavorable to this party. And give a reason for scoring this score (Reason), don't simply say it favor to which party, say why it favor to which party. Generate new json file, which contains main events(and RD Score, Reason of each event) of each date, and count the number of events of each date.



## GPT4o Output

Let's start by examining the contents of the uploaded file, `main_events_by_date.json`. This will help us understand the structure of the data and then process each event to calculate the Republican-Democratic (RD) Score with the reasons for each score. After processing, I'll generate a new JSON file with the updated information. Let's take a look at the file now.
It seems that the JSON data is structured as a list, not a dictionary. Let's take another look at the first couple of entries to understand the structure.
The data is structured as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains:

- `date`: The date of the events.
- `main_events`: A list of events that occurred on that date.
- `event_count`: The number of events on that date.

Next, let's process each event to calculate the Republican-Democratic Score (RD Score) and provide a reason for each score. Then, I'll generate a new JSON file with this information and count the number of events for each date.

Let's proceed with this task.
The events have been processed to include the Republican-Democratic (RD) Score and a reason for each score. The updated data has been saved to a new JSON file:
