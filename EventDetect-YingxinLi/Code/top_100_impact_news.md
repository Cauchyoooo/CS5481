## GPT4o Output

To address your request, I'll start by examining the contents of the file `main_events_by_date.json`. Let's take a look at it.
It seems that the JSON file is loaded as a list, not a dictionary. Let's inspect the first few entries to understand the structure of the data.
The JSON data consists of entries that describe events related to the 2024 US election. Each event includes a date, a list of main events, and an event count. To fulfill your request, I need to do the following:

1. **Identify the Events with Greatest Impact:** I'll select 100 events that I believe have the greatest impact based on their descriptions.

2. **Sort by Impact and Create a New JSON File:** I will sort these events by their perceived impact from greatest to least and then save the top 100 into a new JSON file.

Let's proceed with evaluating this data to select and sort the most impactful events.To effectively determine the events with the greatest impact, we must first clarify what constitutes "impact" in this context. Since we are not using external information from the internet to evaluate the events' impacts, the selection will be based on the content and nature of the events described in each entry. Considering:
- **Legal significance or major legal actions** (e.g., impeachment proceedings, significant court rulings).
- **High-profile political endorsements or announcements** (e.g., major endorsements from political figures or organizations).
- **Events with a nationwide or international focus** (e.g., actions or announcements that seem to have broader implications or interest).

Based on these criteria, the next step is to parse through the events and identify those that align with these categories for selection. Let's go ahead and process this data.
I have selected and sorted the top 100 events based on their perceived impact and saved them into a new JSON file. You can download the file using the link below:
