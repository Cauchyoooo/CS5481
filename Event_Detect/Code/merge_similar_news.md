> Here we use GPT4o to help us detect the main events

## Input

`te_news.json`

## prompt

Here are some news about 2024 US Elections. Each event of the content forms [ title ]: summary. You need to Merge similar events on each date, or in a period (the period should shorter than a week, put the merged event on the last date).  For each date, summary the main events according their title and summary. Generate the new json file which includes main events of each dates and count the number of events of each date.



## GPT4o Output

It seems that the JSON data is structured as a list. Let's examine the first few entries of the list to understand the structure of the data.
The JSON data is structured as a list of entries, where each entry represents news data for specific dates. Each entry contains the following key elements:
- `date`: The date of the news events.
- `events`: A list of events with each event described in the format "[title]: summary".
- `news_count`: The number of news items/events for that particular date.

Next, I will process this data to:
1. Merge similar events on each date or within a period shorter than a week.
2. Summarize the main events according to their title and summary for each date.
3. Generate a new JSON file which includes the main events of each date and the count of events.

Let's proceed with this task.
I have processed the data to merge similar events for each date, summarized the main events according to their titles and summaries, and generated a new JSON file with the results.
